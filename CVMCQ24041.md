### 🫠 Pericardial Disease: Constrictive Pericarditis After Radiation Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Echocardiography** is the preferred initial test in the evaluation of possible **constrictive pericarditis**.
2. **Constrictive pericarditis** is characterized by **pericardial thickening** that impairs **diastolic filling** and limits **total cardiac volume**.
3. Causes of **constrictive pericarditis** include **cardiac surgery**, **chest irradiation**, **autoimmune disease**, and **tuberculosis**, although many cases are **idiopathic**.
4. **Constrictive pericarditis** most commonly presents as **indolent progression** of **right-sided heart failure** symptoms, such as **abdominal distention from ascites** and **peripheral edema**.
5. Physical exam signs of **constrictive pericarditis** include **elevated central venous pressure (CVP)** with **prominent x and y descents**, **Kussmaul sign** (paradoxical inspiratory increase in CVP), and a **pericardial knock**.
6. **Hemodynamic cardiac catheterization** may confirm constrictive pericarditis but is reserved for cases where noninvasive studies are inconclusive.
7. **Liver biopsy** and **ultrasound elastography** are not indicated when signs point to **cardiac disease** rather than primary **hepatic pathology**.
8. Ascitic fluid with a **high serum albumin-ascites gradient** and **elevated protein content** suggests a **cardiac etiology** rather than **cirrhosis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Echocardiography** can demonstrate exaggerated **ventricular interdependence**, a hallmark of constriction due to a rigid pericardium.
3. In many cases of constrictive pericarditis, no clear cause is identified despite extensive evaluation.
6. **Invasive testing** is appropriate only after a non-diagnostic **echocardiogram**.
7. The presence of **elevated CVP**, **ascites**, and **right-sided heart failure** signs makes **liver disease** less likely.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Radiation therapy to the thorax** is associated with a wide spectrum of **cardiovascular complications**, including **pericardial disease**, **valvular dysfunction**, **conduction abnormalities**, **myocardial fibrosis**, and **coronary artery disease**.
2. **Constrictive pericarditis** occurs in **10% to 20%** of patients **5 to 10 years** after **chest radiation therapy**, even in those who never had **acute pericarditis**.
3. **Pericardial calcification** is not always visible in cases of **radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis**.
4. **Radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis** can cause **diastolic dysfunction** and **restrictive cardiomyopathy** physiology.
5. Differentiating **restrictive cardiomyopathy** from **constrictive pericarditis** is critical, as treatment and prognosis differ.
6. Radiation-related **valvular disease** most often affects **left-sided valves** and progresses from **regurgitation** to **mixed regurgitation and stenosis** over time.
7. Radiation therapy may damage the **aorta**, leading to **calcification** that complicates surgical aortic valve replacement.
8. Up to **75%** of long-term survivors of **mediastinal radiation** show **conduction abnormalities** on **ECG**, including **sinus node dysfunction** and **heart block**.
9. **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** after radiation is more likely to involve **ostial**, **long**, **smooth**, and **concentric lesions** with a **high fibrotic content**.
10. Radiation-associated **aortic stenosis** is linked to **worse surgical outcomes** and **higher cardiovascular mortality** compared to non-radiation patients.
11. In patients with prior radiation, **percutaneous aortic valve replacement** is often preferred over **surgical approaches**.
12. **Stress echocardiography** is recommended **5–10 years** after radiation therapy or by **age 30**, whichever comes first, for surveillance.
13. **Serum biomarkers** are **not recommended** for routine surveillance of radiation-induced cardiac disease.
14. **Routine nuclear imaging** or **coronary computed tomography (CT)** should be avoided in asymptomatic patients post-radiation.
15. **Statins**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**, and **aldosterone antagonists** are not proven to **prevent radiation-induced cardiovascular disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Late-onset constriction may occur even without any prior history of **acute pericarditis**, underscoring the need for long-term follow-up.
4. Radiation-induced fibrosis leads to **restrictive physiology** that can mimic other forms of **cardiomyopathy**.
6. Valvular lesions begin with **retraction-related regurgitation** and later develop **fibrosis and calcification**.
8. These conduction defects may necessitate **permanent pacemaker** implantation, especially after **valve surgery**.
9. Radiation-accelerated atherosclerosis differs **morphologically** from traditional CAD, influencing **revascularization decisions**.
10. Higher mortality is observed both **short-term and long-term** after **valve surgery** in patients with prior radiation exposure.
12. Early detection through **noninvasive imaging** is advised even in **asymptomatic** cancer survivors.
14. These tests have **limited utility** in low-risk, asymptomatic individuals and may result in **false positives**.
15. Current evidence does not support **primary prevention** of radiation-related cardiotoxicity with pharmacologic therapy.
