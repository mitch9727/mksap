### 🫀 Cardio‑Oncology: Trastuzumab Cardiotoxicity

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Trastuzumab**, a monoclonal antibody used to treat **human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive cancers**, can cause **reversible left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction**, resulting in clinical heart failure symptoms in approximately **3 % – 7 %** of treated patients.  
2. The risk of **trastuzumab‑induced cardiotoxicity** is higher in **patients older than 50 years** and in those who receive **concomitant anthracycline chemotherapy**.  
3. Patients receiving **trastuzumab** should undergo serial **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** to monitor **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)** and detect early, asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction.  
4. Expert consensus recommends **holding trastuzumab temporarily** when **LVEF falls by >15 percentage points from baseline** or **drops by ≥10 percentage points to a value <50 %**.  
5. **Trastuzumab therapy may be resumed** once **LV function normalizes** after drug withdrawal, because the cardiotoxicity is usually **reversible**.  
6. Patients whose **LVEF remains ≥50 %** during **trastuzumab** treatment can generally **continue therapy** without evidence of long‑term cardiac injury.  
7. **TTE** is sufficient for both **initial detection** and **follow‑up assessment** of **trastuzumab‑related cardiac dysfunction**; **cardiac catheterization is not required** for routine monitoring.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Unlike anthracycline cardiotoxicity, trastuzumab‑related LV dysfunction is **not dose dependent** and typically improves within weeks to months after stopping the drug.  
2. Age‑related decline in cardiac reserve and prior anthracycline exposure create a vulnerable myocardial substrate that amplifies trastuzumab toxicity.  
3. The optimal frequency of TTE surveillance during trastuzumab therapy is individualized, but many centers perform imaging **every 3 months** in high‑risk patients.  
4. The LVEF threshold for interruption of therapy is derived from prospective trials and expert guidelines to balance cancer control with cardiac safety.  
5. Restoration of normal LVEF allows oncologists to **re‑initiate trastuzumab** and maintain oncologic efficacy without compromising long‑term cardiac outcomes.  
6. Observational studies report **no increase in heart failure events or mortality** when LVEF remains at or above 50 % during trastuzumab therapy.  
7. Non‑invasive imaging avoids procedural risks and provides additional data (for example, **global longitudinal strain**) that may detect subclinical dysfunction earlier than LVEF alone.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chemotherapy‑associated cardiotoxicity** includes both **reversible myocardial injury** (for example, with **trastuzumab**) and **dose‑dependent, irreversible injury** (for example, with **anthracyclines**).  
2. Before starting potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, clinicians should **optimize traditional cardiovascular risk factors** and identify **patients at greatest long‑term cardiac risk**.  
3. **Acute anthracycline cardiotoxicity** occurs in **<1 %** of patients, may manifest as **arrhythmias, heart block, myocarditis, pericarditis, or heart failure**, and is usually **reversible**.  
4. **Chronic progressive anthracycline cardiomyopathy** is typically **irreversible**, presents as **dilated cardiomyopathy**, and is most strongly linked to **doxorubicin** exposure, although **epirubicin** and **idarubicin** can also be implicated.  
5. The incidence of **heart failure** rises to **≈26 %** when the **cumulative anthracycline dose reaches 550 mg/m²**, and toxicity may not become apparent until **10 – 20 years** after treatment.  
6. **Dexrazoxane**, an **iron‑chelating agent**, reduces **anthracycline‑induced cardiotoxicity** and should be considered in **high‑risk patients**.  
7. Risk‑reduction strategies for anthracycline therapy include **continuous infusion** rather than bolus dosing and use of **liposomal doxorubicin formulations**.  
8. **Targeted cancer therapies** such as **trastuzumab**, **multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors** (for example, **sunitinib**), and **anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies** (for example, **bevacizumab**) frequently cause **reversible left ventricular dysfunction or hypertension**.  
9. **Sunitinib** is associated with **new or worsened hypertension in up to 50 %** of patients and **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction in up to 15 %**, effects that are generally **reversible with early recognition and management**.  
10. Baseline and surveillance testing for chemotherapy cardiotoxicity should include **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**; measuring **global longitudinal strain (GLS)** can detect **early, subclinical left ventricular dysfunction** more sensitively than ejection fraction alone.  
11. For patients receiving **anthracyclines**, it is reasonable to repeat TTE at a **cumulative dose of 250 mg/m²** and **before each additional dose** in those with **pre‑existing LV dysfunction** or when higher cumulative doses are planned.  
12. During **trastuzumab** therapy, the drug should be **withheld temporarily** if **LVEF falls by >15 percentage points from baseline** or **drops ≥10 percentage points to <50 %**.  
13. A **relative GLS decline >15 %** is considered **subclinical LV dysfunction** and should prompt **cardiology consultation**.  
14. Surveillance for **sunitinib cardiotoxicity** should include baseline **N‑terminal pro–B‑type natriuretic peptide (NT‑proBNP)** measurement and **LVEF assessment at baseline, 1 month, and every 3 months** thereafter.  
15. In patients who develop **clinical signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction** during chemotherapy, evaluation with **cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT‑proBNP)** and **TTE including GLS** is recommended, and treatment follows **standard heart failure guidelines** while decisions about continuing chemotherapy are **individualized**.
16. **High-dose anthracycline chemotherapy** (≥250 mg/m² doxorubicin or ≥600 mg/m² epirubicin) is a recognized factor that increases a cancer survivor’s long-term cardiovascular risk.
17. **Combined anthracycline + trastuzumab therapy** confers a higher likelihood of delayed cardiomyopathy than either agent used alone.
18. Thoracic **radiation of ≥30 Gy that includes the heart** in the treatment field is an independent predictor of late-onset cardiovascular disease.
19. **Alkylating agents** (for example, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide) can precipitate chemotherapy-related **left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction**.
20. Anti-metabolite therapy with **5‑fluorouracil or capecitabine** is strongly associated with **chemotherapy-induced myocardial ischemia**.
21. **Bevacizumab**, an anti‑vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, may produce **hypertension** *and* **ischemia** during treatment.
22. **Thalidomide**, an angiogenesis inhibitor, is linked to **venous thromboembolism** and can also provoke **bradycardia or atrioventricular block**.
23. **Oxaliplatin** therapy can **prolong the QT interval** and trigger **torsades de pointes** ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
24. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor **vandetanib** likewise carries a recognized risk of **marked QT prolongation** leading to torsades de pointes.
25. **Doxorubicin** exposure has been associated with **monomorphic ventricular tachycardia** in addition to its well-known cardiomyopathy.
26. **Paclitaxel** infusion may cause **transient bradycardia or atrioventricular nodal block** during administration.
27. **Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide** have been implicated in chemotherapy-related **atrial fibrillation** even in patients without prior structural heart disease.

#### 💬 Extra
3. These acute effects typically occur during or shortly after anthracycline infusion and often resolve with cessation of the drug and supportive care.  
5. Dose‑dependent anthracycline cardiomyopathy underscores the importance of lifetime dose limits and long‑term cardiac surveillance in survivors.  
9. Early interruption of **sunitinib** and initiation of antihypertensive or heart‑failure therapy can hasten recovery of blood pressure and LVEF.  
12. Observational studies show that resuming **trastuzumab** after LVEF recovery does not appear to increase long‑term cardiac risk.
16. The ≥250 mg/m² anthracycline threshold helps identify patients who should receive baseline and serial echocardiography for early cardiotoxicity detection.
17. Synergistic cardiotoxicity from combined DNA‑topoisomerase II inhibition and HER2 blockade underlies the high risk with concurrent anthracycline‑trastuzumab therapy.
18. Radiation‑induced heart disease may manifest years later as coronary artery disease, valvular stenosis, constrictive pericarditis, or LV dysfunction.
19. Cyclophosphamide‑related cardiomyopathy often appears within days of high‑dose therapy used for bone‑marrow conditioning.
20. 5‑Fluorouracil–induced coronary vasospasm can mimic an acute coronary syndrome and typically resolves with nitrates and calcium‑channel blockers.
21. Bevacizumab‑related hypertension is usually manageable with standard antihypertensive agents; ischemia is less common but warrants prompt evaluation.
22. Because of its thrombotic risk, thalidomide therapy often requires prophylactic low‑dose aspirin or anticoagulation in high‑risk patients.
23. Monitoring electrolytes and obtaining baseline and periodic electrocardiograms are recommended during oxaliplatin therapy.
24. Vandetanib’s label recommends ECG monitoring and correction of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia before and during therapy.
25. Ventricular arrhythmias with doxorubicin typically signify significant myocardial injury and may necessitate treatment interruption.
