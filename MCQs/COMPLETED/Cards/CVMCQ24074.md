### 🫀 Cardiology: Constrictive Pericarditis Treatment  

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. **Chronic constrictive pericarditis** is treated definitively with surgical **pericardial stripping (pericardiectomy)**.  
2. **Transient constrictive pericarditis** presents with pericardial constriction plus systemic or pericardial inflammation (for example, fever or elevated inflammatory markers) and is managed like **acute pericarditis** using **anti-inflammatory therapy** and **diuretics**.  
3. Chronic constrictive pericarditis is characterized by a **fibrotic or calcified pericardium** that restricts diastolic filling and limits total cardiac volume.  
4. Constrictive pericarditis most commonly manifests with **right-sided heart failure** and **systemic volume overload**, including ascites.  
5. **Pericardial thickening, fibrosis, or calcification** produce ventricular interdependence and impair diastolic ventricular filling in constrictive pericarditis.  

#### 💬 Extra  
1. Ventricular interdependence can be demonstrated by Doppler echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or invasive hemodynamic evaluation in constrictive pericarditis but is absent in restrictive cardiomyopathy.  
2. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as **ibuprofen** and **colchicine** are reserved for acute or transient pericardial inflammation and are ineffective in chronic fibrotic constriction.

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. Both **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** and **constrictive pericarditis** cause similar symptoms and echocardiographic findings, so distinguishing between them is essential because pericardiectomy can relieve symptoms and prolong life in constrictive disease.  
2. In patients with **prior cardiac surgery, pericarditis, or chest irradiation**, constrictive pericarditis should be strongly suspected when heart-failure symptoms develop.  
3. The **Kussmaul sign** (rise in the jugular venous waveform during inspiration) is more common in constrictive pericarditis than in RCM.  
4. **Pericardial calcification** on chest radiography or CT and **pericardial thickening** on CT or cardiac MRI favor a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis over RCM.  
5. A **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level below 100 pg/mL (100 ng/L)** supports constrictive pericarditis, whereas BNP is usually **≥400 pg/mL (400 ng/L)** in RCM.  
6. **Ventricular interdependence**—reciprocal filling of the ventricles limited by a rigid pericardium—is a hallmark of constrictive pericarditis and is absent in RCM.  
7. An **opening snap** is a **high‑frequency** diastolic sound of **mitral stenosis** heard best at the left lower sternal border and apex.
8. A **pericardial knock** is a **high‑frequency** early diastolic sound of **constrictive pericarditis** heard throughout the precordium and associated with deep x and y jugular venous descents.
9. A **tumor plop**, linked to an **atrial myxoma**, is a **low‑frequency** diastolic sound heard best at the apex and may vary with patient position.
10. An **S<sub>3</sub> gallop** is a **low‑frequency** diastolic sound associated with **heart failure**, best heard at the apex in the left lateral decubitus position.

#### 💬 Extra  
1. Ventricular interdependence can be demonstrated by Doppler echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or invasive pressure tracings.  
2. Differentiating constriction from restriction guides therapy: pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis versus medical management or transplantation evaluation for RCM.  
7. The opening snap follows mitral valve opening and precedes the diastolic rumble characteristic of rheumatic mitral stenosis.
8. The pericardial knock occurs earlier than a physiologic S<sub>3</sub> because ventricular filling abruptly halts when the non‑compliant pericardium reaches its limit.
9. The tumor plop represents the myxoma striking the ventricular wall or valve apparatus during diastole.
10. Presence of an S<sub>3</sub> often indicates elevated left ventricular filling pressures and reduced ejection fraction.
