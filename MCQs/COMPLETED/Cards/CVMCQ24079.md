### 🫀 Pericardial Disease: Acute Pericarditis Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Post–cardiac injury syndrome (Dressler syndrome)** is a secondary form of **pericarditis** that may occur after **acute myocardial infarction**, **cardiac surgery**, **traumatic injury**, or **endovascular procedures**.
2. First-line treatment for **acute pericarditis**, including post–cardiac injury syndrome, includes **high-dose aspirin** or another **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)** and **colchicine**.
3. **Colchicine** is recommended to **shorten symptom duration** and **reduce treatment failure and recurrence** in acute pericarditis.
4. **Glucocorticoids**, such as **prednisone**, are not indicated in the **acute treatment of pericarditis** and are typically avoided in the **first month after cardiac surgery**.
5. Most patients with **acute pericarditis** can be **managed as outpatients** unless high-risk features are present.
6. **Predictors of complicated pericarditis** include **temperature >38.0 °C (100.4 °F)**, **subacute onset**, **large pericardial effusion (>20-mm diastolic echo-free space)** or **tamponade**, **oral anticoagulation therapy**, or **lack of response after 1 week of treatment**.
7. The **clinical course of acute pericarditis** is usually **benign**, but complications such as **cardiac tamponade** and **constrictive pericarditis** may occur.
8. **Sinus tachycardia** in acute pericarditis often resolves with **treatment of the underlying inflammation**.
9. **Pericardiocentesis** is reserved for patients with **cardiac tamponade** or **other severe complications** of pericarditis.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This syndrome is also known as Dressler syndrome and typically occurs after a cardiac injury.
2. Aspirin or an NSAID like ibuprofen is used for 1 to 2 weeks as standard therapy.
3. Colchicine is added to prevent recurrence and improve outcomes.
4. Glucocorticoids are reserved for nonresponsive, recurrent, or specific types of pericarditis, and their use soon after cardiac surgery may impair healing.
5. Outpatient treatment is generally sufficient unless high-risk criteria are met.
6. These high-risk features help guide hospitalization and more intensive monitoring.
7. Although rare, serious complications from untreated or refractory pericarditis may necessitate intervention.
8. Although sinus tachycardia may be present, increasing β-blocker therapy is not appropriate unless other indications like heart failure or ischemia are present.
9. The patient in the vignette had no evidence of tamponade and therefore did not require pericardiocentesis.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Most patients with **acute pericarditis** can be treated **as outpatients**, but those with **high-risk features** may require hospitalization.
2. High-risk predictors include **temperature >38.0 °C**, **subacute onset**, **large pericardial effusion**, **cardiac tamponade**, **oral anticoagulation**, and **lack of response after 1 week**.
3. First-line treatment for **acute idiopathic pericarditis** is **high-dose aspirin** or **NSAIDs** for 1 to 4 weeks, with **colchicine** as adjunctive therapy.
4. In **recurrent pericarditis**, a **longer course of standard therapy** with **slow tapering** may be required.
5. **C-reactive protein (CRP)** levels may be used to monitor treatment response and guide tapering.
6. **Glucocorticoid therapy** is reserved for **recurrent, incessant, chronic, autoimmune, or uremic pericarditis**, or when **NSAIDs are contraindicated**.
7. **Rilonacept**, an **interleukin-1 inhibitor**, is an effective **glucocorticoid-sparing therapy** in **refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis**.
8. **Athletes** should avoid **competitive exercise for 3 months** from pericarditis onset; **nonathletes** should avoid strenuous activity until **symptoms resolve**.
9. **Prednisone** for recurrent pericarditis is dosed at **0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg** and continued for **3 months**.
10. Tapering of **prednisone** should not be initiated until **2 to 4 weeks** of therapy have elapsed or **CRP has normalized**.
11. Patients with **pericarditis after myocardial infarction** (post-infarction pericarditis or PIP) are managed with **acetaminophen and aspirin**, avoiding **other NSAIDs** and **glucocorticoids**.
12. In **post-infarction pericarditis**, **colchicine** is generally **not beneficial**.
13. **Tuberculous pericarditis** is treated with **standard antituberculosis therapy**, which reduces the risk of **constrictive pericarditis** from over 80% to less than 10%.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Most uncomplicated pericarditis cases are managed outpatient unless red flags are present.
2. These clinical features identify those at risk for progression or poor outcomes.
3. Colchicine improves both symptom duration and recurrence prevention.
4. Slow tapering is especially important in patients who relapse off therapy.
5. Normalization of CRP is a helpful sign to begin tapering therapy.
6. Steroids are not first-line due to increased recurrence risk and complications.
7. Rilonacept is used in refractory patients as a second-line agent.
8. Physical exertion can exacerbate inflammation or trigger relapse.
9. This dose of prednisone is added to standard therapy when NSAIDs/colchicine fail or are contraindicated.
10. This approach prevents premature withdrawal and recurrence.
11. PIP is treated differently than idiopathic or post-cardiac injury pericarditis.
12. The inflammatory mechanism in PIP differs, limiting colchicine's utility.
13. Tuberculosis is a unique etiology of pericarditis with distinct treatment goals.
