### 🫠 Pericardial Disease: Imaging Features of Constrictive Pericarditis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Constrictive pericarditis** is characterized by **pericardial thickening**, **fibrosis**, and sometimes **calcification** that impair **diastolic filling** and limit **total cardiac volume**.  
2. **Chest radiography** or **computed tomography (CT)** may demonstrate **partial or circumferential pericardial calcification** in patients with **constrictive pericarditis**.  
3. **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** or **CT** may demonstrate **pericardial thickening greater than 3 mm** in constrictive pericarditis.  
4. The presence of **pericardial constriction** can exist **even in the absence** of **pericardial thickening** or **calcification**.  
5. On **chest radiograph**, **pericardial calcification** may be seen on both **posterior-anterior** and **lateral views**, as illustrated in the embedded image below:

#### 💬 Extra
5. The radiographic findings of **pericardial calcification** in both chest views are highlighted in the provided image, supporting the diagnosis of **constrictive pericarditis**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Constrictive pericarditis** is most commonly idiopathic, but it can also be caused by **tuberculosis**, **cardiac surgery**, **chest irradiation**, **autoimmune disease**, or **bacterial infection**.
2. **Right-sided heart failure symptoms**, including **peripheral edema** and **abdominal swelling**, are the most common presentation of **constrictive pericarditis**.
3. **Exertional dyspnea** and **fatigue** in constrictive pericarditis are caused by **increased diastolic pressures** and an inability to increase **cardiac output** due to a **fixed stroke volume**.
4. Physical examination in constrictive pericarditis reveals **elevated central venous pressure** with **prominent x and y descents** in the jugular venous waveform.
5. **Kussmaul sign**, a paradoxical rise or lack of fall in jugular venous pressure on inspiration, is commonly seen in **constrictive pericarditis**.
6. **Pericardial knock** is an **early diastolic heart sound** in constrictive pericarditis, heard throughout the precordium, occurring earlier than **S₃**, and associated with prominent x and y descents.
7. **Peripheral edema**, **ascites**, **hepatomegaly**, and **pleural effusions** are common findings in **constrictive pericarditis**.
8. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** may show **low voltage** in constrictive pericarditis, but no ECG finding is specific.
9. **Transthoracic echocardiography** in constrictive pericarditis shows **normal ventricular size and systolic function**, but **dilated inferior vena cava** due to elevated right atrial pressure.
10. **Tissue Doppler** and **Doppler echocardiography** help differentiate **constrictive pericarditis** from **restrictive cardiomyopathy**, based on the presence of **preserved myocardial relaxation**.
11. **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** may show **inspiratory septal shift**, consistent with **ventricular interdependence**.
12. **Right heart catheterization** in constrictive pericarditis demonstrates a **dip-and-plateau** (square root) sign and **ventricular pressure discordance** during respiration.
13. During inspiration, **right ventricular systolic pressure increases** while **left ventricular systolic pressure decreases** in constrictive pericarditis, demonstrating **ventricular interdependence**.
14. **Pulsus paradoxus** is less commonly seen in constrictive pericarditis compared with **cardiac tamponade**.
15. In **transient constrictive pericarditis**, symptoms may include **fever**, **chest pain**, and **elevated inflammatory markers** such as **erythrocyte sedimentation rate** or **C-reactive protein**.
16. **Pericardial effusion** is more likely in patients with **transient constrictive pericarditis** than in those with fixed constriction.
17. **Pericardiectomy** is effective in **constrictive pericarditis**, but not in **restrictive cardiomyopathy**, making distinction between the two conditions essential.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Tuberculosis remains a key cause of constrictive pericarditis in endemic areas.
2. These symptoms reflect chronic systemic venous congestion.
4. The prominent y descent distinguishes constrictive pericarditis from cardiac tamponade, where the y descent is blunted.
6. The pericardial knock is a hallmark auscultatory finding in constrictive pericarditis.
9. The dilated IVC reflects impaired venous return due to elevated right-sided pressures.
10. Preserved or enhanced relaxation helps rule out restrictive cardiomyopathy.
12. The square root sign on right ventricular waveform represents early rapid diastolic filling followed by abrupt cessation.
13. These findings are visualized during simultaneous RV/LV pressure tracing in catheterization studies.
15. Transient constrictive pericarditis may follow **recent cardiac surgery**, **acute pericarditis**, **autoimmune disease**, or **chemotherapy**.
16. Effusion in transient cases reflects the ongoing inflammatory process.
