### 🫠 Cardiology: Posterior Myocardial Infarction Diagnosis via Modified Lead ECG

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** but nondiagnostic initial testing, **serial electrocardiograms (ECGs)** and, in some cases, **modified lead ECGs** are indicated to identify evolving **ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**.
2. In **posterior myocardial infarction**, **ST-segment depression** in anterior precordial leads with **tall R waves** suggests posterior injury; diagnosis is confirmed by **≥1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads V7, V8, or V9** on modified ECG.
3. Recognition of **ST-segment elevation** in **posterior leads V7 and V8** is diagnostic of **posterior myocardial infarction** and indicates the need for **immediate reperfusion therapy**.
4. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** or **thrombolytic therapy** is indicated in all patients with **STEMI** unless contraindicated; **PCI** is preferred if available within **120 minutes** of first medical contact.
5. **Thrombolytic therapy** is relatively contraindicated in patients with **a history of ischemic stroke**.
6. In **non–ST-elevation ACS**, **serial troponin testing** and use of **risk scores** (such as **TIMI** or **GRACE**) help guide timing of invasive management like coronary angiography.
7. **Urgent coronary angiography** is appropriate within **2 hours** in patients with suspected ACS who have **hemodynamic, electrical, or symptomatic instability**, even in the absence of ST-segment elevation.
8. **Temporary pacemaker implantation** may be indicated in **ACS** with **symptomatic high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block**, but is **not required** for **hemodynamically stable, vagally mediated sinus bradycardia**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. The patient's ECG showed **precordial ST depression** with tall R waves and isolated ST elevation in lead III, consistent with **posterior myocardial infarction**.
3. The diagnostic **≥1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads V7 and V8** was demonstrated in the provided modified lead ECG image (see below).
5. This patient’s **history of ischemic stroke** makes thrombolytics less desirable, reinforcing the need for clarity before initiating reperfusion.
6. **TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction)** and **GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events)** are validated risk scoring systems for non-ST-elevation ACS.
8. The patient had **sinus bradycardia** but was **hemodynamically stable**, so no pacemaker was needed.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** is diagnosed by **ST-segment elevation of ≥1 mm in two or more contiguous limb or chest leads**, except in leads **V2 and V3**, where the threshold is **≥2 mm in men** and **≥1.5 mm in women**.
2. **New left bundle branch block (LBBB)** may be considered a **STEMI equivalent**, suggesting **acute left anterior descending artery occlusion** or **extensive myocardial injury**.
3. In patients with **preexisting left bundle branch block (LBBB)** or **paced rhythms**, **STEMI diagnosis by ECG is less reliable**.
4. **Right bundle branch block (RBBB)** does **not obscure ST-segment elevation patterns** on ECG.
5. A **posterior myocardial infarction (MI)** is indicated by **ST-segment depression >2 mm in leads V1-V4** with **tall R waves**, and may involve **posterior, lateral, and inferior walls**.
6. The **De Winter sign** (tall, symmetric T waves) and **Wellens sign** (deeply inverted or biphasic anterior T waves) suggest **high-risk left anterior descending artery disease** and may evolve to **ST-segment elevation** on serial ECGs.
7. **Acute pericarditis** is associated with **concave ST-segment elevation** and **PR-segment depression**, which may mimic **STEMI**.
8. **Pericarditis or myopericarditis** can cause **cardiac enzyme elevation**, necessitating differentiation from STEMI using **clinical features and ECG**.
9. **Acute aortic syndromes** may cause **ST-segment elevation** if **coronary arteries are involved**, and can be identified by **differential upper extremity blood pressures**, **tearing chest pain**, and **mediastinal widening** on chest radiograph.
10. **Severe hypercalcemia** may mimic acute coronary syndrome with **ST-segment elevation**, and is typically associated with **short QT interval** and **flattened T waves** on ECG.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ST-elevation thresholds differ for leads V2-V3 due to normal variant differences by sex.
2. New LBBB may obscure ST elevation, but its presence in the appropriate clinical context can imply transmural ischemia.
3. In these settings, ECG interpretation requires greater clinical correlation.
4. RBBB does not distort ST segments the way LBBB does, allowing for more reliable interpretation.
5. These findings reflect a posterior wall infarction and may benefit from posterior lead placement (V7-V9) to aid diagnosis.
6. These dynamic patterns require repeat ECGs for progression to STEMI; they represent early high-risk findings.
7. These ECG changes plus positional or pleuritic chest pain support a diagnosis of pericarditis.
8. Overlapping ECG and biomarker changes can complicate diagnosis in inflammatory conditions.
9. Prompt identification is critical as aortic dissection is a surgical emergency.
10. Electrolyte abnormalities should be considered in differential diagnoses of ST elevations.
