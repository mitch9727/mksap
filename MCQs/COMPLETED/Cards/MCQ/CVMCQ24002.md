### 🫠 Coronary Artery Disease: Pharmacoinvasive Management After Thrombolytic Therapy for STEMI

#### ✅ True Statements
1. For patients with **ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** who receive successful **thrombolytic therapy**, elective **invasive coronary angiography** is recommended **3 to 24 hours** after lysis as part of a **pharmacoinvasive strategy** to define coronary anatomy and enable complete revascularization.
2. **Thrombolytic therapy** is indicated for **STEMI** when symptom onset is **≤12 hours** and **primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** cannot be performed within **120 minutes** of first medical contact.
3. Successful reperfusion after thrombolysis is demonstrated by **≥50% resolution of maximal ST‑segment elevation** on follow‑up **electrocardiography (ECG)** performed **60–90 minutes** after lytic administration.
4. Routine **immediate (<3 hours) coronary angiography and PCI** after thrombolytic therapy are **not recommended** in patients with evidence of successful reperfusion because very early intervention increases bleeding and thrombotic complications without additional benefit.
5. **Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA)** is **not recommended** for risk stratification in patients with **STEMI** treated with thrombolytics because invasive coronary angiography is already indicated before discharge.
6. **Noninvasive ischemia testing**, such as **exercise treadmill testing**, should **not** be performed prior to discharge when coronary angiography is planned after thrombolytic therapy for **STEMI**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Elective angiography improves outcomes by enabling complete revascularization of nonculprit lesions that contribute to future ischemic risk.
2. The mortality benefit of thrombolysis declines rapidly with treatment delay; primary PCI remains preferred when it can be performed within guideline time frames.
3. Failure to achieve the ECG reperfusion criterion signals failed lysis and mandates **rescue PCI**.
4. Very early routine PCI after lysis is reserved for patients without reperfusion or with clinical instability, where benefits outweigh bleeding risk.
5. CTA would neither change prognosis nor obviate the need for invasive angiography and thus adds cost and contrast exposure without benefit.
6. Stress testing offers no incremental information once all patients are destined for invasive evaluation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Thrombolytic therapy** may be considered for patients presenting **12–24 hours** after STEMI symptom onset when **hemodynamic instability** or extensive myocardium at risk exists and timely primary PCI is unavailable.
2. **Fibrin‑specific thrombolytic agents** — **alteplase**, **reteplase**, and **tenecteplase** — achieve higher infarct artery patency and cause fewer allergic reactions than **streptokinase**.
3. **Intracerebral hemorrhage** occurs in approximately **1%** of patients receiving thrombolytics for **STEMI** and is often catastrophic.
4. All patients receiving thrombolysis should receive **aspirin 162–325 mg** and **parenteral anticoagulation** with intravenous **unfractionated heparin**, **enoxaparin**, or **fondaparinux**, unless contraindicated.
5. A **300 mg oral clopidogrel loading dose** administered with thrombolytic therapy increases infarct vessel patency and is recommended.
6. If the post‑lytic **ECG** fails to show **≥50% ST‑segment resolution** at **60–90 minutes**, **rescue PCI** should be performed promptly because it improves outcomes compared with conservative management.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This 12–24‑hour window applies when transfer delays make primary PCI impossible and the patient remains at high ischemic risk.
2. Higher cost is the primary limitation to routine use of fibrin‑specific agents despite their superior efficacy and safety profile.
3. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for thrombolysis aim to minimize catastrophic intracranial bleeding.
4. Dual antithrombotic therapy reduces re‑occlusion and reinfarction after pharmacologic reperfusion.
5. Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is continued until revascularization and subsequently per guideline recommendations.
6. The ≥50% ST‑segment resolution threshold is a validated surrogate marker for infarct artery patency and successful reperfusion.
