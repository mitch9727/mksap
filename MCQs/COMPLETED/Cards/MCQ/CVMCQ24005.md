### 🫠 Aortic Disease: Acute Ascending Aortic Dissection

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute aortic dissection** is a potential mimic of **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** and can present with ST-segment elevation if the dissection involves the **right coronary artery ostium**, resulting in **myocardial ischemia**.
2. **Diagnostic clues** to acute ascending aortic dissection include **tearing chest pain radiating to the back**, **differential upper extremity pulses or blood pressures**, **aortic insufficiency**, **pulsus paradoxus**, and **mediastinal widening on chest radiograph**.
3. **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)**, **magnetic resonance angiography**, and **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** have **similar sensitivity and specificity** for diagnosing **acute thoracic aortic disease**.
4. **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)** is the most commonly performed imaging modality in suspected **aortic dissection** due to its **speed** and **widespread availability**.
5. **Acute thoracic aortic dissection** is a **surgical emergency** that requires **emergent thoracic surgery**.
6. In cases of suspected **acute aortic dissection**, **primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is inappropriate and may delay necessary surgical treatment due to the need for **anticoagulation** and **dual antiplatelet therapy**.
7. In **acute aortic dissection**, **intravenous fluid resuscitation** is not appropriate in the setting of **aortic insufficiency** and **pulmonary edema**.
8. In **acute ascending aortic dissection**, neither **intravenous anticoagulation** (e.g., **unfractionated heparin**) nor **thrombolytic therapy** is appropriate due to increased **bleeding risk** and interference with pending **surgical intervention**.
9. The only initial medical therapy with benefit in **acute ascending aortic dissection** is **blood pressure control**, usually achieved with **intravenous β-blockers**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads may occur if the dissection compromises coronary perfusion.
3. Despite equivalent diagnostic accuracy, CTA is preferred in most emergency settings.
4. CTA is readily accessible in most emergency departments and provides rapid imaging of the entire thoracic aorta.
5. Surgical intervention often involves emergent repair of the ascending aorta to prevent rupture or tamponade.
6. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) and anticoagulation complicate intraoperative management due to bleeding risk.
7. Volume overload may worsen left-sided filling pressures and pulmonary edema in patients with aortic regurgitation.
8. These therapies are commonly used in myocardial infarction but are contraindicated in dissection.
9. β-blockers reduce shear stress on the aortic wall by lowering heart rate and blood pressure.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** is diagnosed by **ST-segment elevation of ≥1 mm in two or more contiguous limb or chest leads**, except in leads **V2 and V3**, where the threshold is **≥2 mm in men** and **≥1.5 mm in women**.
2. **New left bundle branch block (LBBB)** may be considered a **STEMI equivalent**, suggesting **acute left anterior descending artery occlusion** or **extensive myocardial injury**.
3. In patients with **preexisting left bundle branch block (LBBB)** or **paced rhythms**, **STEMI diagnosis by ECG is less reliable**.
4. **Right bundle branch block (RBBB)** does **not obscure ST-segment elevation patterns** on ECG.
5. A **posterior myocardial infarction (MI)** is indicated by **ST-segment depression >2 mm in leads V1-V4** with **tall R waves**, and may involve **posterior, lateral, and inferior walls**.
6. The **De Winter sign** (tall, symmetric T waves) and **Wellens sign** (deeply inverted or biphasic anterior T waves) suggest **high-risk left anterior descending artery disease** and may evolve to **ST-segment elevation** on serial ECGs.
7. **Acute pericarditis** is associated with **concave ST-segment elevation** and **PR-segment depression**, which may mimic **STEMI**.
8. **Pericarditis or myopericarditis** can cause **cardiac enzyme elevation**, necessitating differentiation from STEMI using **clinical features and ECG**.
9. **Acute aortic syndromes** may cause **ST-segment elevation** if **coronary arteries are involved**, and can be identified by **differential upper extremity blood pressures**, **tearing chest pain**, and **mediastinal widening** on chest radiograph.
10. **Severe hypercalcemia** may mimic acute coronary syndrome with **ST-segment elevation**, and is typically associated with **short QT interval** and **flattened T waves** on ECG.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ST-elevation thresholds differ for leads V2-V3 due to normal variant differences by sex.
2. New LBBB may obscure ST elevation, but its presence in the appropriate clinical context can imply transmural ischemia.
3. In these settings, ECG interpretation requires greater clinical correlation.
4. RBBB does not distort ST segments the way LBBB does, allowing for more reliable interpretation.
5. These findings reflect a posterior wall infarction and may benefit from posterior lead placement (V7-V9) to aid diagnosis.
6. These dynamic patterns require repeat ECGs for progression to STEMI; they represent early high-risk findings.
7. These ECG changes plus positional or pleuritic chest pain support a diagnosis of pericarditis.
8. Overlapping ECG and biomarker changes can complicate diagnosis in inflammatory conditions.
9. Prompt identification is critical as aortic dissection is a surgical emergency.
10. Electrolyte abnormalities should be considered in differential diagnoses of ST elevations.
