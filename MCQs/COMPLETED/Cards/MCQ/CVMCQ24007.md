### 🫠 Cardiovascular Disease: Cardiogenic Shock Management in STEMI

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiogenic shock** has a mortality rate greater than **50%** and requires **early recognition** and treatment.
2. The initial treatment of **cardiogenic shock following ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** includes **prompt reperfusion** therapy and **inotrope support**.
3. **Inotrope therapy** such as **dobutamine infusion** is used to improve **systemic perfusion** in low-output states associated with cardiogenic shock.
4. **Vasopressors** may be used in conjunction with inotropes to maintain **adequate mean arterial pressure** in **cardiogenic shock**.
5. **Mechanical circulatory support devices** offer temporary hemodynamic support in cardiogenic shock but are not definitively associated with **improved survival** and may cause **bleeding or thrombotic complications**.
6. **β-Blockers**, including **metoprolol**, are **contraindicated** in patients with **cardiogenic shock**.
7. **Intravenous β-blockers** are not indicated in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to association with **adverse outcomes**.
8. **Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** in patients with **STEMI and cardiogenic shock** is associated with **worse outcomes** and should not be performed emergently for **non–infarct-related arteries**.
9. **Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** is not indicated in cardiogenic shock patients who have already undergone **culprit artery reperfusion**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Features of cardiogenic shock include hypotension, hypoxemia, confusion, cool extremities, and poor urine output with elevated lactate.
2. Dobutamine increases cardiac output by stimulating β1-receptors, improving tissue perfusion.
5. Examples include intra-aortic balloon pumps, percutaneous left ventricular assist devices, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
6. β-Blockers depress myocardial contractility and can worsen hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion in shock.
8. Multivessel PCI may increase the risk of acute kidney injury and major adverse cardiovascular events in this setting.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiogenic shock** is a common complication of **large anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** and is caused by **severely reduced left ventricular systolic function**.
2. Clinical signs of **cardiogenic shock** include **hypotension**, **sinus tachycardia**, **cool extremities**, **oliguria**, and **altered mentation**.
3. **Untreated cardiogenic shock** may progress to **end-organ failure**, including **acute kidney injury**, **hepatic failure**, or **mesenteric infarction**.
4. **Immediate infarct-related artery reperfusion** improves **survival** in **cardiogenic shock**, especially in patients **younger than 75 years**.
5. **Multivessel PCI** of nonculprit vessels during cardiogenic shock is associated with **worse renal outcomes** and **higher adverse cardiovascular events**.
6. **Intra-aortic balloon pump**, **percutaneous ventricular assist devices**, or **extracorporeal membrane oxygenation** may be used as **temporary support** in cardiogenic shock.
7. **Data supporting survival benefit** from **percutaneous support** in **myocardial infarction–related cardiogenic shock** are **limited**, requiring **careful patient selection**.
8. **β-Blockers** should be **avoided initially** in cardiogenic shock and only introduced when the patient is **hemodynamically stable**.
9. **Diuretics** may be used to treat **pulmonary vascular congestion** in cardiogenic shock once perfusion is stabilized.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Cardiogenic shock results from impaired myocardial contractility and low cardiac output.
3. Prolonged hypoperfusion can lead to irreversible tissue injury and multiorgan dysfunction.
6. These devices can serve as a bridge to recovery, durable support, or transplant.
7. Consideration includes bleeding risk, prognosis, and availability of resources.
9. Caution is required to avoid volume depletion and worsening perfusion.
