### 🫠 Acute Coronary Syndromes: Reperfusion Failure After Thrombolysis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is the preferred reperfusion strategy for patients with **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**.
2. **Thrombolytic therapy** is recommended for patients with **STEMI** if **symptom onset is within 12 hours** and **primary PCI is not available within 120 minutes** of first medical contact.
3. Patients undergoing **thrombolysis** should receive **aspirin**, **intravenous unfractionated heparin**, **enoxaparin**, or **fondaparinux**, and a **300 mg oral clopidogrel loading dose**.
4. **Thrombolytic therapy** is most effective within the **first 3 to 6 hours** after symptom onset.
5. **One quarter to one third of patients** treated with thrombolysis do not achieve successful reperfusion, particularly in the setting of **delayed presentation**.
6. In cases of **failed reperfusion after thrombolysis**, **rescue PCI** is associated with **improved outcomes** compared with conservative management.
7. **Early routine transfer** of patients after thrombolysis facilitates **early rescue PCI** in cases of reperfusion failure or reocclusion.
8. **Repeat thrombolytic therapy** is **not recommended** for failed reperfusion following initial thrombolysis.
9. **Tirofiban**, an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, is **not indicated** after adequate **P2Y12 inhibitor loading** in patients with failed reperfusion after thrombolysis.
10. **Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography** should not delay urgent **PCI** in the setting of clear evidence of **failed reperfusion** in STEMI.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PCI enables mechanical reperfusion and restoration of coronary flow and is associated with lower mortality in STEMI.
2. This time threshold reflects guideline-directed therapy when PCI is not rapidly available.
3. This combination improves vessel patency and outcomes in patients receiving thrombolysis.
4. Delayed administration reduces efficacy and increases likelihood of reperfusion failure.
5. Failure to reperfuse is associated with continued ischemia and infarct expansion.
6. Rescue PCI offers a higher likelihood of reperfusion and reduced infarct size compared to noninvasive options.
7. Transfer protocols aim to minimize time to PCI in the event thrombolysis is unsuccessful.
8. Repeat lytic therapy has not shown consistent benefit and increases bleeding risk.
9. Tirofiban is typically reserved for use in the catheterization lab in selected patients with high thrombus burden.
10. Persistent chest pain and unchanged ST elevation are sufficient indicators of failed reperfusion, warranting immediate intervention.

#### ✅ True Statements

18. In **STEMI patients with successful reperfusion after thrombolysis**, **coronary angiography** should ideally be performed **within 24 hours**, but **not within the first 2 to 3 hours**.

20. **Emergency coronary angiography** is indicated in **STEMI patients with persistent chest pain and failed thrombolysis**, regardless of initial hospital capabilities.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This thrombotic event results in sudden cessation of myocardial perfusion.
2. Prompt reperfusion reduces infarct size and improves clinical outcomes.
3. PPCI is more reliable than thrombolysis in restoring vessel patency.
4. Delays beyond this goal are associated with worse myocardial salvage.
5. Studies have shown lower event rates with complete revascularization strategies.
6. This approach may minimize ischemic burden without delaying PPCI.
7. These agents lyse fibrin-bound clots more efficiently but are more expensive.
8. This bleeding risk is the major limitation of systemic thrombolysis.
9. Serial ECG monitoring helps determine the need for rescue PCI.
10. Angiography allows for detection of residual stenosis or reocclusion.
11. This risk reflects the high likelihood of rebleeding in previously compromised cerebrovascular tissue.
12. Uncontrolled or active bleeding may be worsened by thrombolytic-induced fibrinolysis.
13. Postoperative central nervous system healing remains vulnerable to bleeding risks from systemic thrombolytics.
14. Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with thrombolytic agents.
15. This threshold defines a critical range where bleeding risk may outweigh benefit but is not automatically exclusionary.
16. The 30-minute benchmark represents the system-wide performance goal for thrombolytic therapy initiation.
17. ST resolution monitoring guides the decision to proceed with **rescue PCI**.
18. Early angiography may confound thrombolytic efficacy assessment or increase bleeding risk.
19. This approach improves long-term outcomes and minimizes staged re-intervention in carefully selected patients.
20. Rescue PCI provides mechanical revascularization when pharmacologic reperfusion is inadequate.

    ePatients with STEMI presenting to a hospital without PCI capabilities and who cannot be transferred to a PCI-capable center and undergo PCI within 120 minutes of FMC (“door-to-balloon time”) should be treated with thrombolytic therapy within 30 minutes of hospital presentation (“door-to-needle time”) as a systems goal unless thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. It is reasonable to transfer patients treated with thrombolytic therapy to a PCI-capable center for subsequent coronary angiography. Angiography should not be performed within 2 to 3 hours after successful thrombolytic therapy but is ideally performed within 24 hours. Emergent coronary angiography is indicated for patients with clinical thrombolysis failure, including patients with persistent chest pain and/or &lt;50% resolution of baseline ST-segment elevation at 60-90 minutes following thrombolytic administration.<br>
    fIn patients with successful reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy, it is reasonable to transfer these patients to a PCI-capable center for subsequent coronary angiography. Angiography should not be performed within 2 to 3 hours after thrombolytic therapy administration but is ideally performed within 24 hours.<br>
