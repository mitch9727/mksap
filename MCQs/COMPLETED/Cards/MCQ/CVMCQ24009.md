### 🫠 Cardiology: HEART Score for Chest Pain Risk Stratification

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients presenting with **chest pain**, the **HEART score** (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin) is a validated tool to determine the likelihood of an **acute ischemic process** and to stratify risk for **30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE)**.
2. The **HEART Clinical Decision Pathway**, which incorporates the HEART score and a 3-hour **follow-up troponin level**, can identify patients with **very low risk (~1%)** of short-term adverse events.
3. A **HEART score less than 3** suggests that a patient may be safely **discharged without additional immediate cardiovascular testing**.
4. In patients at **intermediate or high risk** for acute coronary syndrome, other risk scores such as **Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)** and **Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE)** help guide **treatment intensity**.
5. **Repeat ECGs** are only warranted if there is **clinical change** or ongoing concern for **evolving myocardial ischemia**.
6. **Repeat high-sensitivity troponin T testing** is useful when there is concern for **early presentation** or **clinical deterioration**, but is unlikely to be useful if serial levels are already normal.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The HEART score incorporates 5 elements: patient **history**, **ECG** findings, **age**, **risk factors**, and **troponin**.
2. A HEART score of **2** is associated with a **≤1% risk of MACE** in the next 6 weeks.
3. Use of the HEART score may allow for **early discharge** in low-risk patients, avoiding unnecessary testing or admission.
4. The **TIMI score** predicts **14-day risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization**.
5. This patient had a **normal ECG** and no ongoing chest pain or status change.
6. Serial normal troponin levels more than **3 hours after symptom onset** reduce the utility of further testing.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chest pain** is the most common presenting symptom of **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**, though **dyspnea**, **fatigue**, and **weakness** may be more prominent in **women**, **older adults**, and those with **diabetes mellitus**.
2. **Electrocardiography (ECG)** should be performed within **10 minutes** of presentation for suspected ACS and repeated every **15 to 30 minutes** as needed.
3. **ST-segment elevation** on ECG necessitates **urgent consideration of reperfusion therapy**.
4. In **non–ST-elevation ACS**, **serial ECGs** and **serial high-sensitivity troponin (hsTn)** measurements provide prognostic information.
5. A **summative risk score**, such as the **HEART score**, helps identify patients at **low risk** (<1%) for **30-day adverse cardiac events**.
6. In patients with **greater risk**, inpatient evaluation is recommended, with treatment intensity guided by **TIMI** or **GRACE** scores.
7. The **TIMI risk score** predicts **14-day mortality**, **recurrent myocardial infarction**, and **need for urgent revascularization**.
8. The **GRACE risk score** estimates **in-hospital**, **1-year**, and **3-year mortality** and myocardial infarction risk.
9. Identification of a **rise-and-fall pattern** in serial troponin measurements is essential for diagnosing **myocardial infarction**.
10. The **HEART score**, when modified to include a 3-hour troponin level, provides sufficient sensitivity to **rule out ACS** in selected low-risk patients.
11. The **TIMI risk score** for non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes assigns **1 point** for each of the following: **age ≥65 years**, **three or more traditional coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors**, **known CAD with ≥50% stenosis**, **ST-segment deviation**, **≥2 anginal episodes in 24 hours**, **aspirin use in the past week**, and **elevated cardiac biomarkers**.
12. A **TIMI score of 0–2** indicates **low risk**, **3–4** indicates **intermediate risk**, and **5–7** indicates **high risk** of short-term adverse cardiac events.
13. Initial inpatient management of **non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)** includes **aspirin**, **β-blockers**, **nitrates**, **anticoagulation**, **oxygen if hypoxic**, and **prognostic stratification** using scores such as **TIMI** or **GRACE**.
14. **Clopidogrel or ticagrelor** may be initiated at the time of hospital admission for **suspected ACS**.
15. If **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** is needed, **clopidogrel or ticagrelor** should be **stopped 5 days prior** to surgery to reduce bleeding risk.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atypical presentations are especially common in **older adults**, **women**, and **patients with diabetes**.
2. Early ECG interpretation helps rapidly identify **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**, prompting emergent treatment.
6. Patients with higher risk often require **admission**, **cardiac monitoring**, and **early invasive evaluation**.
8. The GRACE score includes variables such as **age**, **heart rate**, **blood pressure**, **serum creatinine**, and **cardiac enzyme levels**.
11. These seven variables are used to estimate the short-term likelihood of death or major ischemic events in patients with suspected non–ST-elevation ACS.
12. Risk categories help guide decisions on inpatient monitoring and early invasive strategies.
14. P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor are started early in ACS to reduce platelet aggregation and prevent thrombus formation.
15. Stopping P2Y12 inhibitors for at least 5 days prior to CABG lowers the risk of excessive surgical bleeding by allowing platelet recovery.
