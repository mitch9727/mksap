### 🫠 Cardiology: Medical Therapy for Persistent Angina

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **symptomatic stable coronary artery disease**, **β-blockers**, **nitrates**, **calcium channel blockers**, and **ranolazine** are indicated for symptom control, used at optimized doses and potentially in combination.
2. **β-Blockers** and **calcium channel blockers** are recommended as **first-line antianginal therapy** in patients with **stable coronary artery disease**.
3. **Nitrates** improve **myocardial oxygen delivery** through **coronary vasodilation** and reduce **oxygen demand** by decreasing **preload** and **ventricular wall stress**.
4. The beneficial effects of **nitrates** may be offset by **reflex tachycardia** unless combined with **β-blockers** or **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**.
5. **Long-acting nitrates**, such as **isosorbide mononitrate**, **isosorbide dinitrate**, and **nitroglycerin patch formulations**, provide **constant vasodilation** but require an **8- to 12-hour nitrate-free interval** to prevent tolerance.
6. Side effects of **nitrates** include **headache**, **flushing**, and **hypotension**.
7. Concurrent use of **nitrates** and **phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors** (e.g., **sildenafil**) is **contraindicated** due to the risk of **hypotension**.
8. **Ivabradine** inhibits the **Iᶠ current**, lowers **heart rate** without significant hemodynamic effects, and is approved for **stable heart failure** in the U.S. and **stable angina** in Europe in patients intolerant to β-blockers.
9. **Ranolazine** reduces **myocardial wall tension** and **oxygen consumption**, may be effective for **angina relief**, and is associated with **QT prolongation** and **drug interactions** via the **cytochrome P-450 3A4** pathway.
10. **Sustained-release diltiazem** improves **myocardial oxygen delivery** via **coronary vasodilation** and reduction in **coronary vascular resistance**, but should be used cautiously in **bradycardia** or **reduced ejection fraction** due to **negative chronotropic and inotropic effects**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient's **angina symptoms persist** despite **β-blocker therapy**, indicating the need for **additional antianginal medication**.
5. A nitrate-free interval helps prevent **nitrate tolerance**, which can reduce drug efficacy.
7. Co-administration with **sildenafil** can result in **profound hypotension**, which may be life-threatening.
9. **Dose reduction** of ranolazine may be required when combined with **verapamil** or **diltiazem**.
10. This patient has **bradycardia** likely due to **metoprolol**, making **diltiazem** a suboptimal choice without modifying or stopping β-blocker therapy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **β-Blockers**, **calcium channel blockers**, and **nitrates** are effective **first-line antianginal medications** for patients with **stable chronic angina**.
2. **β-Blockers** reduce **myocardial oxygen demand** by lowering **heart rate**, **myocardial contractility**, and **blood pressure**.
3. All **β-blockers** are equally effective in reducing angina symptoms, and the choice among them may depend on **comorbid conditions** such as **left ventricular dysfunction**, **kidney dysfunction**, **lung disease**, or **hypertension**.
4. The dosage of **β-blockers** should be titrated to achieve a **resting heart rate** of **55 to 60 beats per minute**.
5. **β-Blockers** should be used with caution in patients taking **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (e.g., **verapamil**, **diltiazem**) due to additive **negative inotropic and chronotropic effects**.
6. **β-Blockers** should also be used with caution in patients with **significant conduction disease** or **left ventricular dysfunction**.
7. **β₁-selective β-blockers** such as **metoprolol** and **bisoprolol** are preferred in patients with **lung disease** to avoid respiratory complications.
8. In patients with **reduced left ventricular function**, **metoprolol succinate**, **bisoprolol**, and **carvedilol** are associated with **reduced long-term mortality**.
9. Common side effects of **β-blockers** include **fatigue**, **lethargy**, **sleep disturbances**, and **erectile dysfunction**.
10. **Calcium channel blockers** improve **myocardial oxygen delivery** via **coronary vasodilation** and reduce **oxygen consumption** through **antihypertensive** and **negative inotropic effects**.
11. **Short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (e.g., **short-acting nifedipine**) should be avoided because they may worsen angina through **reflex tachycardia**.
12. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** should be avoided in patients with **left ventricular dysfunction** due to increased **adverse events** from **negative inotropy and chronotropy**.
13. **Short-acting sublingual nitrates** should be prescribed for **acute relief of angina**.
14. A **nitrate-free interval** of **8 to 12 hours**, typically at night, is necessary to prevent **nitrate tolerance**.
15. **Ranolazine** reduces **myocardial wall tension** and **oxygen consumption** by inhibiting the **late sodium current**, reducing **calcium overload**.
16. **Ranolazine** may be used in patients with **anginal chest pain** that persists despite **β-blocker**, **calcium channel blocker**, and/or **nitrate therapy**.
17. **Ranolazine** has a **modest QT-prolonging effect** but does **not cause proarrhythmia**.
18. **Ranolazine** should not be used with **strong CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g., **clarithromycin**, **itraconazole**, **ketoconazole**, **some HIV medications**).
19. **Ivabradine** inhibits the **If current**, lowers **heart rate** and **ischemic burden**, and is approved in the **U.S.** for **stable heart failure**, and in **Europe** for **stable angina** in **β-blocker–intolerant patients**.

21. **Ivabradine** side effects include **visual disturbances**, **headache**, **bradycardia**, and **QTc prolongation**.

23. **Coronary sinus reducer implantation** is an emerging device therapy for **refractory angina** management.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Comorbidity-directed β-blocker choice helps avoid adverse events in patients with complex medical histories.
5. Co-administration increases risk for bradycardia and AV block.
8. These agents have mortality benefit demonstrated in randomized trials for HFrEF.
11. Reflex tachycardia increases myocardial oxygen demand, worsening ischemia.
14. Tolerance reduces nitrate efficacy over time without this interval.
16. Ranolazine is useful for symptom relief when other medications are insufficient.
18. Strong CYP3A4 inhibition causes ranolazine serum levels to increase, raising toxicity risk.
19. Ivabradine’s U.S. approval is limited to HFrEF; off-label angina use not supported domestically.
22. Counterpulsation enhances diastolic perfusion and reduces afterload.
