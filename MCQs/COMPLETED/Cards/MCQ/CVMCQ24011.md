### 🫠 Cardiology: Refractory Angina Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **External counterpulsation (ECP)** and **spinal cord stimulation** have demonstrated **antianginal benefit** in patients with **refractory angina** who have **exhausted standard revascularization options** and remain symptomatic despite **optimal medical therapy**.
2. **External counterpulsation (ECP)** uses **three sets of pneumatic cuffs** that contract sequentially on the **lower extremities** to **augment venous return**, **increase aortic diastolic pressure**, and **enhance coronary artery blood flow**.
3. **External counterpulsation (ECP)** is generally well tolerated and effective in **reducing angina symptoms** and **increasing exercise tolerance**, even though patients with **marked left ventricular systolic dysfunction** may tolerate it less well.
4. **Repeat anatomic testing** (e.g., **coronary angiography**, **cardiac magnetic resonance viability assessment**) or **functional testing** (e.g., **regadenoson myocardial perfusion imaging**) is **not indicated** in patients with **stable symptoms** and previously documented **unrevascularizable coronary disease**.
5. **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** with **clopidogrel** and **aspirin** is **not indicated** as an antianginal strategy and may **increase bleeding risk** without benefit in patients **without recent stenting** or **acute coronary syndrome**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient has persistent **lifestyle-limiting anginal symptoms** despite **maximally tolerated medical therapy** and **no standard revascularization options**, making **ECP** the most appropriate management.
2. The mechanism of action mimics **diastolic augmentation**, improving myocardial perfusion.
3. Intermittent use allows most patients to **tolerate volume shifts**, especially when **left ventricular function is preserved**.
4. Repeat imaging may be warranted only in cases of **changing symptoms**, particularly **acute coronary syndrome**, which could reveal newly **treatable disease**.
5. **Clopidogrel** is indicated for **secondary prevention** after **stent placement** or **acute coronary syndrome**, not for chronic stable angina alone.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **β-Blockers**, **calcium channel blockers**, and **nitrates** are effective first-line antianginal medications in patients with **stable chronic angina**.
2. **β-Blockers** relieve angina by reducing **heart rate**, **myocardial contractility**, and **blood pressure**, thereby lowering **myocardial oxygen demand**.
3. All **β-blockers** are equally effective in managing angina symptoms, with choice influenced by comorbidities.
4. In patients with **chronic lung disease**, **β₁-selective β-blockers** such as **metoprolol** and **bisoprolol** are preferred to minimize pulmonary side effects.
5. In patients with **reduced left ventricular function**, **metoprolol succinate**, **bisoprolol**, and **carvedilol** reduce **long-term mortality**.
6. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**, such as **diltiazem** and **verapamil**, are contraindicated in **left ventricular systolic dysfunction** due to negative inotropic effects.
7. **Short-acting dihydropyridines**, like **nifedipine**, should be avoided in angina due to reflex tachycardia and increased myocardial oxygen demand.
8. **Nitrates** lower myocardial oxygen demand by **reducing preload**, which decreases **ventricular wall stress**.
9. **Long-acting nitrate therapy** must include a **daily nitrate-free interval of 8 to 12 hours** to prevent **tolerance**.
10. **Ranolazine** does not significantly lower blood pressure or heart rate and has **no proarrhythmic effects**, despite its **QT-prolonging property**.
11. **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**, including **clarithromycin**, **itraconazole**, and **ketoconazole**, are contraindicated with **ranolazine** due to increased risk of toxicity.
12. **Ivabradine**, an If current inhibitor, is not recommended in the U.S. for treating **stable coronary disease without heart failure**.
13. **All patients with angina or a history of ischemic events** should receive **guideline-directed medical therapy**, including **risk factor modification**, **cardioprotective medications**, and **antianginal medications** to improve functional capacity.
14. In **stable angina**, **low-dose aspirin** is indicated in all patients without contraindication; **clopidogrel** is an acceptable alternative in aspirin-intolerant patients.
15. **High-intensity statin therapy** is a cornerstone of treatment in **coronary artery disease (CAD)** due to its benefit in reducing **myocardial infarction (MI)**, **stroke**, and **death**.
16. In **type 2 diabetes mellitus** and **stable CAD**, a **SGLT2 inhibitor** or **GLP-1 receptor agonist** is the preferred treatment for diabetes.
17. **ACE inhibitors** are indicated in **stable angina** with **diabetes**, **chronic kidney disease**, **left ventricular dysfunction**, or **heart failure**.
18. **Ranolazine** reduces **angina** without affecting **blood pressure**, and is useful in patients with **persistent symptoms** despite optimized therapy.
19. **External enhanced counterpulsation** may be considered for **refractory angina** in patients not eligible for **revascularization**.
20. **Ezetimibe** and **PCSK9 inhibitors** may be used in patients not at LDL goal on statin therapy.
21. **Icosapent ethyl** provides additional risk reduction in patients with **hypertriglyceridemia** when added to statins.
22. **β₁-selective β-blockers** such as **metoprolol** and **bisoprolol** are preferred in patients with **lung disease**.
23. **Long-acting nitrates** require a **nitrate-free interval** of 8–12 hours to prevent **tolerance**.
24. **Ranolazine** reduces **wall tension** and **myocardial oxygen consumption** through **late sodium current inhibition**.
25. **Ranolazine** requires **dose reduction** with **moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors** and **avoidance** with **strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**.
26. **Coronary sinus reducer implantation** is an emerging **device therapy** for **refractory angina**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These medications balance myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
2. Oxygen demand reduction is key in exertional angina.
3. β-blocker choice may depend on comorbid hypertension, kidney disease, or lung disease.
4. Nonselective agents (e.g., propranolol) can worsen asthma or COPD.
5. These agents have been proven in large-scale trials for HFrEF.
6. Negative inotropes reduce contractility and can worsen heart failure.
7. Reflex tachycardia increases cardiac work and ischemia.
8. Nitrates relieve symptoms by reducing cardiac filling pressures.
9. Tolerance reduces therapeutic effectiveness unless nitrate-free intervals are observed.
10. This makes ranolazine ideal for patients who cannot tolerate hemodynamic changes.
11. These inhibitors increase ranolazine serum levels by preventing metabolism.
12. Ivabradine use is restricted by U.S. guidelines to HFrEF and not angina.
16. These agents provide both glycemic control and cardiovascular benefit, especially in patients with coexisting CAD.
18. Choice among these agents depends on comorbidities such as heart failure, arrhythmia, or hypotension.
21. Inclisiran and bempedoic acid may be considered in select statin-intolerant or high-risk patients.
24. Common moderate **CYP3A4 inhibitors** include **verapamil** and **diltiazem**.
25. QT monitoring is advised due to ranolazine's electrophysiologic effects, especially in elderly or polypharmacy patients.
26. The **coronary sinus reducer** increases pressure in the coronary venous system to improve subendocardial perfusion.
