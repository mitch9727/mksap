### 🫠 Cardiology: Stress Cardiomyopathy Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stress cardiomyopathy** (also known as **takotsubo cardiomyopathy** or **apical ballooning syndrome**) may present with **chest pain**, **elevated cardiac biomarkers** (e.g., **troponin T**), and **ECG changes** including **ST-segment elevation** and/or **deep T-wave inversion** in the **anterior precordial leads**.
2. Despite ECG and biomarker findings suggesting **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**, patients with **stress cardiomyopathy** typically have **normal coronary arteries** on angiography with **no acute occlusion**.
3. Imaging with **echocardiography** or **ventriculography** in stress cardiomyopathy usually reveals **systolic mid and apical ballooning** with **sparing of the base of the heart**.
4. **Stress cardiomyopathy** is a **diagnosis of exclusion**, requiring exclusion of **obstructive coronary disease**.
5. **Management of stress cardiomyopathy** is **supportive** and may include **β-blockers**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** (e.g., **captopril**), or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, along with **risk factor modification**.
6. **Left ventricular (LV) function** in stress cardiomyopathy **usually recovers** over the ensuing **weeks to months**.
7. **Inotropes** (e.g., **dobutamine**) may worsen **LV outflow tract obstruction** in stress cardiomyopathy and are **not recommended** unless absolutely necessary.
8. In patients with stress cardiomyopathy and hemodynamic instability, **hemodynamic support** may include **volume expansion** and/or **vasopressor therapy** with **minimal inotropic effects** (e.g., **phenylephrine**).
9. **Diuretics** (e.g., **furosemide**) may be used to relieve **congestion** in stress cardiomyopathy if **symptomatic volume overload** is present.
10. **Thrombolytic agents** (e.g., **tenecteplase**) and **revascularization** are **not beneficial or recommended** in stress cardiomyopathy in the absence of **occlusive coronary disease** and **plaque rupture**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The described patient had **deep anterior T-wave inversions**, **positive cardiac biomarkers**, and a **normal coronary angiogram** with **apical ballooning** seen on **left ventriculography**, consistent with stress cardiomyopathy.
2. **Dobutamine** was specifically contraindicated due to its potential to worsen dynamic obstruction in this condition.
3. **Furosemide** was not indicated because there was no evidence of congestion or volume overload.
4. **Tenecteplase** was ruled out because there was no acute coronary occlusion or plaque rupture.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. **Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA)** may present with **chest pain**, **elevated cardiac troponin levels**, and **ST-segment elevation on ECG**, but without obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Common causes of **MINOCA** include **spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)**, **coronary vasospasm**, **cardiac syndrome X**, and **stress cardiomyopathy**.
3. **Thrombolytic agents** and **revascularization** are **not recommended** in MINOCA when **occlusive coronary disease** and **plaque rupture** are absent.
4. **Stress cardiomyopathy** frequently follows a **psychological or physical stressor** and presents with **acute chest discomfort**, **dyspnea**, **ST-segment elevation** or **deep T-wave inversion**, and **elevated cardiac enzyme levels**.
5. **Stress cardiomyopathy** is more common in **women** and is a **diagnosis of exclusion**, characterized by a lack of **significant coronary stenosis** despite notable **wall motion abnormality** on imaging.
6. **Management of stress cardiomyopathy** includes **β-blockers**, **ACE inhibitors**, **ARBs**, and **risk factor modification**, with expected **recovery of LV function** over time.

#### 💬 Extra (Related Text)
1. The term **MINOCA** refers to myocardial infarction with angiographically nonobstructive coronary arteries (<50% stenosis).
2. **Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)** is a major cause of MINOCA in **young women**, particularly in the **peripartum period**, and may require invasive imaging to confirm.
3. **Thrombolytics** and **PCI** are avoided in MINOCA because interventions may not address the underlying pathology and could cause harm.
4. **Stress cardiomyopathy** frequently follows **acute emotional or physical stress** and often involves **transient LV dysfunction**.
5. **Wall motion abnormalities** in stress cardiomyopathy may include **mid or apical ballooning** with **basal sparing**, but variants exist.
6. **Supportive therapy** aims to reduce **neurohormonal stress**, promote **ventricular recovery**, and avoid harmful interventions like inotropes or unnecessary revascularization.
