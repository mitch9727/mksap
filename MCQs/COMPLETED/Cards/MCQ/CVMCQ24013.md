### 🫠 Cardiology: Urgent Coronary Angiography in High-Risk NSTE-ACS

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The timing and need for **coronary artery arteriography** in patients with **type I non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)** is determined by **clinical assessment** and **prognostic risk scores** such as **Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)** and **Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE)**.
2. Patients with **NSTE-ACS** and high-risk features—such as **ongoing chest pain**, **hemodynamic instability**, **ventricular arrhythmias**, or **heart failure**—should undergo **urgent coronary arteriography**.
3. **Urgent coronary angiography** is indicated for patients with **recurrent ventricular arrhythmias** and signs of **ongoing myocardial ischemia** despite appropriate medical therapy.
4. **β-Blockers** or **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** such as **diltiazem** are contraindicated in patients with **acute infarct-related cardiogenic shock** due to the risk of worsening hypotension.
5. **Cardioversion** does not address the underlying **ischemic cause** of **ventricular tachycardia** in high-risk NSTE-ACS and is not the preferred intervention.
6. **Thrombolytic therapy** such as **tenecteplase** is not indicated for **non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)**, even in cases with diffuse ischemic ECG changes.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The TIMI score predicts short-term events such as death and urgent revascularization, while the GRACE score predicts both in-hospital and postdischarge events.
2. This includes patients with **electrical instability** (e.g., symptomatic ventricular tachycardia), **pulmonary edema**, or **diffuse ECG changes**.
3. Revascularization can alleviate ischemia, reduce arrhythmia risk, and improve hemodynamics.
4. These agents reduce heart rate and contractility, potentially exacerbating shock.
5. While atrial fibrillation may contribute to hypotension, restoring rhythm alone will not reduce myocardial ischemia.
6. Thrombolytics are reserved for **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** when percutaneous coronary intervention is delayed.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)** should undergo **clinical assessment** and use of **TIMI** or **GRACE** risk scores to guide treatment, including the need for invasive therapy.
2. The **TIMI risk score** predicts 14-day risk of **death**, **recurrent myocardial infarction (MI)**, and **urgent revascularization**.
3. The **GRACE risk score** predicts **in-hospital and postdischarge death** and **recurrent MI** based on clinical features, ECG findings, and biomarkers.
4. **Thrombolytic therapy** is not recommended and offers **no benefit** in patients with **NSTE-ACS**.
5. **Urgent invasive treatment (within 2 hours)** is recommended in type I NSTE-ACS patients with **hemodynamic instability**, **refractory chest pain**, **acute heart failure**, or **ventricular arrhythmias**.
6. In **high-risk NSTE-ACS** (e.g., **GRACE score >140**, **elevated troponin**, **ST-segment depression**), an **early invasive strategy (within 24 hours)** improves outcomes compared with an ischemia-guided strategy.
7. **Intermediate-risk patients** (e.g., **GRACE score 109–140**, **diabetes**, **chronic kidney disease**, **LV dysfunction**) may be evaluated with **delayed invasive coronary angiography within 72 hours**.
8. **Low-risk patients** (e.g., **TIMI score <2**, **GRACE score <109**) may be managed with an **ischemia-guided strategy**, reserving catheterization for ongoing symptoms or positive stress testing.
9. The decision between **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** and **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** is based on **angiographic findings**.
10. In **type 2 NSTE-ACS**, coronary angiography is not indicated; management focuses on **treating the underlying condition** causing increased myocardial oxygen demand.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These scoring systems support objective stratification and decision-making.
2. The TIMI score is simpler and includes factors like age, known coronary artery disease, and ST deviation.
3. The GRACE model incorporates lab and exam data and is validated for mortality prediction.
4. NSTE-ACS is a **non–plaque-rupture** condition and does not benefit from thrombolysis.
5. These are features of **unstable ischemia** requiring immediate catheterization.
6. Early catheterization improves **death, MI, and rehospitalization rates**.
7. Stable patients with moderate risk factors benefit from **invasive evaluation within 72 hours**.
8. Functional assessment (e.g., stress test) is performed prior to discharge if symptoms are controlled.
9. Anatomy and coronary burden inform choice of revascularization strategy.
10. Type 2 ACS arises from **supply-demand mismatch** rather than primary coronary occlusion.
