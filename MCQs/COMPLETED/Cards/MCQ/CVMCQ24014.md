### 🫠 Coronary Artery Disease: Stable Angina Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients with **coronary artery disease (CAD)** should receive **guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)** including **risk factor modification**, **cardioprotective medications**, and **antianginal medications** to improve functional capacity.
2. The **primary goals of revascularization** in **stable coronary artery disease (CAD)** are to **lessen angina** and **improve quality of life**.
3. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is not superior to **guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)** in patients with **stable angina** who do not have **high-risk anatomic features**.
4. **Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** improves survival only in select patients, including those with **left main disease**, **three-vessel CAD**, or **multivessel disease with diabetes mellitus**.
5. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is not indicated in stable CAD without a question of **myocardial viability** or a need for **stress testing**.
6. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is indicated in **stable CAD** for **medically refractory angina**, **inability to tolerate GDMT**, or **high-risk findings on noninvasive testing**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. GDMT includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), lifestyle changes, and antianginal drugs such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers.
3. PCI has not been shown to reduce **myocardial infarction (MI)** or **sudden cardiac death** in this population.
5. CMR imaging is useful for evaluating **myocardial scar or viability**, typically in preparation for potential revascularization decisions.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **angina refractory to medical therapy**, or **markedly abnormal stress test or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA)** results, should be evaluated for **invasive coronary angiography**.
2. The primary goals of **coronary revascularization** in stable syndromes are to **relieve angina symptoms** and **improve quality of life**.
3. In patients with **high-risk clinical or anatomic features** (e.g., **left main CAD**, **large ischemic burden**, or **heart failure**), revascularization may be indicated to **prevent future cardiovascular events** and **improve survival**.
4. **Fractional flow reserve (FFR)** and **instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR)** are invasive physiologic tests used to assess the **hemodynamic significance** of angiographically indeterminate coronary lesions.
5. Use of **FFR** or **iFR** can reduce unnecessary **stenting** and the need for **urgent future revascularization**.
6. **Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** improves survival in patients with **left main coronary artery disease**.
7. **CABG** improves survival in patients with **triple-vessel coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular ejection fraction**.
8. **CABG** improves survival in patients with **multivessel coronary artery disease and reduced ejection fraction less than 35%**.
9. **CABG** improves survival in patients with **diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease**, especially when the **left anterior descending artery** is involved.
10. **CABG** may improve survival in patients with **multivessel coronary artery disease and left ventricular ejection fraction between 35% and 50%**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A detailed discussion of **risks, benefits, and alternatives** to angiography should be part of shared decision-making.
3. These high-risk features help stratify patients who derive **survival benefit** from revascularization, beyond symptom control.
4. FFR and iFR provide **objective, lesion-specific ischemia assessment**, especially in **borderline lesions**.
5. Physiologic testing may help **optimize procedural strategy** during coronary angiography.
6. Left main disease is associated with high-risk ischemia due to a large myocardial territory at risk, making surgical revascularization beneficial.
7. Surgical revascularization offers long-term survival benefit in anatomically extensive disease with preserved ventricular function.
8. Reduced ejection fraction in the setting of multivessel disease signifies ischemic cardiomyopathy, where CABG may offer both symptomatic and prognostic improvement.
9. The involvement of the left anterior descending artery in diabetic patients contributes to extensive myocardial risk, justifying surgical revascularization.
10. Survival benefit in this subgroup is less certain and may depend on patient-specific factors; CABG is a reasonable option in selected patients.
