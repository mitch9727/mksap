### 🫠 Cardiology: Stable Angina Management with Ranolazine

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ranolazine**, an antianginal agent approved for chronic stable angina, reduces wall tension and myocardial oxygen consumption through inhibition of the **late sodium current**, preventing intracellular calcium overload.
2. In patients with **stable angina**, **ranolazine** improves angina symptoms and increases exercise tolerance **without lowering blood pressure or heart rate**, making it useful in patients with baseline hypotension or bradycardia.
3. **Ranolazine** is most appropriate for patients with **stable angina** who continue to experience chest pain despite optimized therapy with **β-blockers**, **calcium channel blockers**, and/or **long-acting nitrates**.
4. **Ranolazine**, unlike some other antianginal agents, has a **modest QT-prolonging effect** but is **not associated with proarrhythmic effects**.
5. In patients treated with **ranolazine**, the **QT interval** should be monitored when coadministered with other **QT-prolonging medications** due to additive risk.
6. In patients receiving **moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors** such as **verapamil** or **diltiazem**, the dose of **ranolazine** should be reduced to avoid elevated serum levels and potential toxicity.
7. Use of **ranolazine** is not contraindicated in patients with **depressed left ventricular (LV) systolic function**, making it a safe option in such cases.
8. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**, including **diltiazem** and **verapamil**, have **negative inotropic effects** and should be avoided in patients with **left ventricular systolic dysfunction** due to the risk of worsening heart failure.
9. **Long-acting nitrates**, such as **isosorbide mononitrate**, require a **daily nitrate-free interval of 8 to 12 hours** to prevent the development of **nitrate tolerance** and maintain antianginal efficacy.
10. In patients with **stable angina** and **resting bradycardia** (heart rate <55–60/min), **increasing β-blocker dosage** such as **metoprolol** is not appropriate due to risk of worsening bradycardia.
11. In patients with **stable exertional angina** who have undergone **complete revascularization** and are on **maximal medical therapy**, the **addition of ranolazine** improves symptoms and exercise tolerance **without affecting blood pressure or heart rate**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Ranolazine works by reducing intracellular sodium and calcium, which decreases myocardial wall tension.
2. Decreased oxygen demand improves anginal symptoms during exertion.
3. The patient described had persistent angina despite revascularization and treatment with **metoprolol** and **isosorbide mononitrate**.
4. Ranolazine’s electrophysiologic safety profile makes it preferable in patients at risk for arrhythmias.
5. QT monitoring is particularly important when used with drugs like **fluoroquinolones**, **antipsychotics**, or **macrolide antibiotics**.
6. CYP3A4 inhibitors slow metabolism of ranolazine, increasing drug exposure and side effect risk.
7. Unlike **diltiazem** or **verapamil**, ranolazine does not depress systolic function.
8. Negative inotropes impair cardiac contractility and can exacerbate symptoms in patients with HFrEF.
9. Nitrate tolerance occurs due to continuous receptor stimulation; a break restores efficacy.
10. This patient’s ECG showed a heart rate of 54/min, precluding further β-blocker up-titration.
11. Ranolazine is particularly useful in patients with angina refractory to standard therapies who cannot tolerate dose escalation due to hypotension or bradycardia.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **β-Blockers**, **calcium channel blockers**, and **nitrates** are effective first-line antianginal medications in patients with **stable chronic angina**.
2. **β-Blockers** relieve angina by reducing **heart rate**, **myocardial contractility**, and **blood pressure**, thereby lowering **myocardial oxygen demand**.
3. All **β-blockers** are equally effective in managing angina symptoms, with choice influenced by comorbidities.
4. In patients with **chronic lung disease**, **β₁-selective β-blockers** such as **metoprolol** and **bisoprolol** are preferred to minimize pulmonary side effects.
5. In patients with **reduced left ventricular function**, **metoprolol succinate**, **bisoprolol**, and **carvedilol** reduce **long-term mortality**.
6. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**, such as **diltiazem** and **verapamil**, are contraindicated in **left ventricular systolic dysfunction** due to negative inotropic effects.
7. **Short-acting dihydropyridines**, like **nifedipine**, should be avoided in angina due to reflex tachycardia and increased myocardial oxygen demand.
8. **Nitrates** lower myocardial oxygen demand by **reducing preload**, which decreases **ventricular wall stress**.
9. **Long-acting nitrate therapy** must include a **daily nitrate-free interval of 8 to 12 hours** to prevent **tolerance**.
10. **Ranolazine** does not significantly lower blood pressure or heart rate and has **no proarrhythmic effects**, despite its **QT-prolonging property**.
11. **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**, including **clarithromycin**, **itraconazole**, and **ketoconazole**, are contraindicated with **ranolazine** due to increased risk of toxicity.
12. **Ivabradine**, an If current inhibitor, is not recommended in the U.S. for treating **stable coronary disease without heart failure**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These medications balance myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
2. Oxygen demand reduction is key in exertional angina.
3. β-blocker choice may depend on comorbid hypertension, kidney disease, or lung disease.
4. Nonselective agents (e.g., propranolol) can worsen asthma or COPD.
5. These agents have been proven in large-scale trials for HFrEF.
6. Negative inotropes reduce contractility and can worsen heart failure.
7. Reflex tachycardia increases cardiac work and ischemia.
8. Nitrates relieve symptoms by reducing cardiac filling pressures.
9. Tolerance reduces therapeutic effectiveness unless nitrate-free intervals are observed.
10. This makes ranolazine ideal for patients who cannot tolerate hemodynamic changes.
11. These inhibitors increase ranolazine serum levels by preventing metabolism.
12. Ivabradine use is restricted by U.S. guidelines to HFrEF and not angina.
