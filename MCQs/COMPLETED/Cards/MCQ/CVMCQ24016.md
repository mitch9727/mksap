### 🫠 Cardiology: Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Drug‑Eluting Stent

#### ✅ True Statements
1. After **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** with a **drug‑eluting stent** for **stable ischemic heart disease**, **dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** with **aspirin** plus a **P2Y12 receptor inhibitor** should be continued for **at least 6 months**.
2. In patients with a **high risk for stent thrombosis**—such as **depressed left ventricular (LV) systolic function**, **diabetes mellitus**, or **saphenous vein graft stenting**—continuation of **dual antiplatelet therapy** beyond 6 months is reasonable when bleeding risk is acceptable.
3. In patients at **high risk for bleeding**, it may be reasonable to **discontinue aspirin after 1–3 months** of DAPT and continue the **P2Y12 inhibitor** alone to reduce bleeding risk.
4. Alternatively, for patients with **high bleeding risk** or **overt bleeding**, **discontinuation of the P2Y12 inhibitor after 3 months** of DAPT with continuation of **lifelong aspirin** is reasonable.
5. Following any **coronary revascularization**, **lifelong single‑antiplatelet therapy with aspirin** is recommended to reduce late stent thrombosis and subsequent ischemic events.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A 6‑month minimum course of DAPT after drug‑eluting stent implantation in stable angina carries a **class I (level A)** recommendation in the 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guideline.
2. Examples of high thrombosis risk factors include **reduced LV ejection fraction (<40%)**, **diabetes mellitus**, and **saphenous vein graft stenting**.
3. Trials evaluating “aspirin‑free” strategies demonstrate lower bleeding rates while maintaining acceptable antiplatelet efficacy when a potent **P2Y12 inhibitor** is continued.
4. Continuing **aspirin alone** maintains coronary protection and is preferred over P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy when the bleeding risk of P2Y12 inhibition outweighs thrombotic concerns.
5. **Aspirin 81 mg daily** remains the cornerstone of secondary prevention after PCI.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Indefinite antiplatelet therapy** is recommended for **all patients** after **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** performed for **stable angina**.
2. After **bare‑metal stent** implantation for **stable coronary disease**, **dual antiplatelet therapy** should be administered for a **minimum of 1 month**.
3. In the setting of an **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**, a **longer duration** of dual antiplatelet therapy is generally indicated than after PCI for stable disease.
4. Patients with **atrial fibrillation** who undergo PCI should receive **triple therapy** with an **oral anticoagulant, aspirin, and clopidogrel** for **1–4 weeks**, after which **aspirin is discontinued**.
5. Between **6 and 12 months** after PCI in such patients, **clopidogrel can be stopped**, and **lifelong oral anticoagulant monotherapy** continued if bleeding risk is high.
6. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** are **contraindicated** in patients with a **mechanical heart valve**; these patients should receive **warfarin plus clopidogrel** when dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated.
7. Routine **periodic ischemic or anatomic testing** is **not recommended** in patients with **stable chronic coronary disease** after revascularization if clinical or functional status is unchanged.
8. After **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** for **stable coronary artery disease**, **12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy** may improve **saphenous vein graft patency**.
9. **Clopidogrel** is dosed with a **300 – 600 mg loading dose** followed by a **75 mg once-daily maintenance dose** when used after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery disease (CAD).
10. **Ticagrelor** is administered as a **180 mg loading dose** and then **90 mg twice daily** for maintenance therapy in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
11. **Prasugrel** is given as a **60 mg loading dose** followed by a **10 mg once-daily maintenance dose**, with a reduced **5 mg once-daily** maintenance dose recommended for patients who weigh **< 60 kg** or are **≥ 75 years old**.
12. **All P2Y₁₂ inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel) have an adverse effect of increased bleeding risk.**
13. **Ticagrelor** can cause **dyspnea** in addition to bleeding risk.
14. **A known allergy** to any specific P2Y₁₂ inhibitor is a **contraindication** to its use.
15. **Prasugrel is contraindicated** in patients with a **history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke**, and carries a **black-box warning for significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Aspirin 81–100 mg daily is the standard lifelong therapy used after PCI.
2. Bare‑metal stents have lower late thrombosis risk, allowing abbreviated DAPT.
3. Plaque instability during ACS increases thrombogenicity, justifying extended therapy.
4. Early discontinuation of aspirin reduces gastrointestinal bleeding while maintaining stroke and myocardial infarction prevention.
5. Continuing only the oral anticoagulant balances stroke prevention with lower hemorrhagic risk.
6. The RE‑ALIGN trial showed excess thrombotic events and bleeding with DOACs in mechanical valves.
7. The 2021 ACC/AHA guideline labels routine stress testing in asymptomatic post‑PCI patients as **low value care**.
8. Vein graft failure is most common within the first year, and DAPT may improve graft longevity.
9. Clopidogrel is also the preferred alternative in ACS when ticagrelor / prasugrel are not tolerated, unavailable, or contraindicated.
10. The weight- and age-adjusted prasugrel dose aims to lower bleeding risk in lighter or older patients.
11. The mechanism of ticagrelor-related dyspnea is thought to be adenosine-mediated.
12. The FDA black-box warning recommends avoiding prasugrel in patients with active pathologic bleeding or prior cerebrovascular events to prevent catastrophic hemorrhage.
