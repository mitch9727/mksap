### 🫠 Cardiology: Antithrombotic Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial **triple antithrombotic therapy** after **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** for **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** in a patient on long‑term oral anticoagulation consists of **aspirin**, **clopidogrel**, and the existing **direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)**.  
2. **Aspirin** should be discontinued **1 to 4 weeks** after PCI, with continuation of **clopidogrel** and the **DOAC** to limit bleeding risk while maintaining stent protection.  
3. **Clopidogrel** should be discontinued **12 months** after PCI, after which **lifelong DOAC monotherapy** is recommended for stroke prevention in **atrial fibrillation (AF)**.  
4. **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** alone is **insufficient** for stroke prevention in AF and must not replace oral anticoagulation.  
5. Extending **triple therapy** beyond **4 weeks** provides no additional ischemic benefit but substantially increases bleeding risk.  
6. **Lifelong triple antithrombotic therapy** is contraindicated because it exposes patients to an unnecessary bleeding risk without improving stent‑related outcomes.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. This 3‑drug regimen, often called **triple therapy**, targets the early period of highest stent‑thrombosis risk after PCI in the setting of ACS.  
2. Early aspirin discontinuation is supported by trials and consensus statements showing reduced gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding with no increase in thrombotic events when clopidogrel and a DOAC are continued.  
3. One year of clopidogrel allows complete endothelialization of drug‑eluting stents; beyond that, the bleeding risk of combination therapy outweighs ischemic benefit.  
4. Stroke in AF is largely cardio‑embolic, and platelet inhibition does not adequately prevent left‑atrial thrombus formation.  
5. Randomized trials of prolonged triple therapy demonstrated higher major‑bleeding rates without reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke, or stent thrombosis.  
6. Current American College of Cardiology (ACC) consensus documents recommend de‑escalation to DOAC monotherapy after the first year in most patients.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. After PCI with a **bare‑metal stent** for stable coronary artery disease, at least **1 month** of **dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** with **aspirin** and a **P2Y12 inhibitor** is recommended.  
2. Following PCI with a **drug‑eluting stent** for stable angina, guidelines advise **≥6 months** of uninterrupted DAPT to prevent late stent thrombosis.  
3. In patients at high bleeding risk, stopping **aspirin** after **1 to 3 months** while maintaining **P2Y12‑inhibitor** monotherapy may reduce hemorrhagic complications.  
4. Alternatively, in high bleeding‑risk patients, discontinuation of the **P2Y12 inhibitor** after **3 months** and continuation of lifelong **aspirin** is acceptable.  
5. Patients with AF who undergo PCI should receive **triple therapy** (oral anticoagulant + aspirin + clopidogrel) for **1 to 4 weeks**, then discontinue **aspirin** and continue clopidogrel together with the anticoagulant.  
6. **Clopidogrel** can be safely stopped **6 to 12 months** after PCI in such patients, leaving lifelong **oral‑anticoagulant monotherapy**.  
7. In patients with a **mechanical heart valve**, **warfarin** combined with **clopidogrel** is recommended, and **DOACs** are **contraindicated**.  
8. Concomitant use of a **proton pump inhibitor (PPI)** or an **H2‑receptor blocker** is recommended to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding when **DAPT** and **oral anticoagulation** are combined.  
9. After **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** for stable coronary artery disease, **12 months** of **DAPT** may improve saphenous‑vein graft patency.  
10. Routine surveillance imaging or stress testing is **not recommended** after coronary revascularization in clinically stable patients without new symptoms or functional decline.  
11. **Clopidogrel** is dosed with a **300 – 600 mg loading dose** followed by a **75 mg once-daily maintenance dose** when used after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery disease (CAD).
12. **Ticagrelor** is administered as a **180 mg loading dose** and then **90 mg twice daily** for maintenance therapy in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
13. **Prasugrel** is given as a **60 mg loading dose** followed by a **10 mg once-daily maintenance dose**, with a reduced **5 mg once-daily** maintenance dose recommended for patients who weigh **< 60 kg** or are **≥ 75 years old**.
14. **All P2Y₁₂ inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel) have an adverse effect of increased bleeding risk.**
15. **Ticagrelor** can cause **dyspnea** in addition to bleeding risk.
16. **A known allergy** to any specific P2Y₁₂ inhibitor is a **contraindication** to its use.
17. **Prasugrel is contraindicated** in patients with a **history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke**, and carries a **black-box warning for significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Bare‑metal stents endothelialize more rapidly, allowing shorter DAPT duration compared with drug‑eluting stents.  
2. Drug‑eluting stents delay endothelialization, necessitating longer platelet inhibition to prevent late stent thrombosis.  
3. Trials of aspirin‑free P2Y12‑inhibitor monotherapy have shown non‑inferiority for ischemic outcomes with fewer bleeding events in selected high‑bleeding‑risk patients.  
4. Aspirin monotherapy retains some antiplatelet effect when early discontinuation of the P2Y12 inhibitor is required.  
5. This step‑down strategy balances early stent‑thrombosis prevention with a lower bleeding burden.  
6. The timing of clopidogrel cessation depends on the interplay between individual bleeding and ischemic risks.  
7. The RE‑ALIGN trial demonstrated excess thromboembolic and bleeding events when dabigatran was used instead of warfarin in mechanical‑valve patients.  
8. Acid‑suppression therapy decreases peptic‑ulcer formation and upper‑gastrointestinal bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy.  
9. Vein‑graft thrombosis is most common in the first year after CABG, and DAPT can enhance graft survival.  
10. Avoiding unnecessary testing aligns with guideline recommendations and reduces cost without compromising outcomes.  
11. Clopidogrel is also the preferred alternative in ACS when ticagrelor / prasugrel are not tolerated, unavailable, or contraindicated.
12. The weight- and age-adjusted prasugrel dose aims to lower bleeding risk in lighter or older patients.
13. The mechanism of ticagrelor-related dyspnea is thought to be adenosine-mediated.
14. The FDA black-box warning recommends avoiding prasugrel in patients with active pathologic bleeding or prior cerebrovascular events to prevent catastrophic hemorrhage.
