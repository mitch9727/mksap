### 🫠 Cardiovascular Risk: ASCVD Risk Assessment and Prevention

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Calculation of 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology **Pooled Cohort Equations** is recommended to identify individuals who may benefit from preventive measures, including **statin therapy**.
2. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **universal lipid screening** in adults aged **40 to 75 years** to assess for **dyslipidemia** and to calculate **ASCVD risk**.
3. **Tobacco use**, the leading preventable cause of death, should be **addressed at every patient visit**.
4. In patients at **borderline or intermediate risk** for ASCVD, **coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring** may help guide decisions about **primary prevention therapy**.
5. **High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)** testing may be reasonable to refine risk stratification in patients with **borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk**, but it is **not the first step** in asymptomatic patients.
6. **Treadmill stress testing** is not indicated for **asymptomatic patients** without symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD); it is best reserved for those with **intermediate pretest probability** where test results would change management.
7. **It is inappropriate to forgo ASCVD risk assessment** even if other preventive interventions such as tobacco cessation are being implemented.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The **Pooled Cohort Equations** help assign a 10-year ASCVD risk and guide discussions about preventive strategies.
2. This age range represents the key window for primary ASCVD prevention in asymptomatic adults.
3. Interventions should include **counseling and pharmacologic therapy** to aid tobacco cessation.
4. CAC scoring is most helpful when the need for statin therapy remains uncertain after risk estimation.
5. hs-CRP may help refine risk when a patient’s 10-year risk is close to a decision threshold.
6. Stress testing lacks utility as a screening tool in **asymptomatic individuals** without concerning symptoms.
7. Risk assessment is essential for guiding **statin eligibility** and other interventions beyond lifestyle advice.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **seven metrics of ideal cardiovascular health** are optimal **lipid levels**, **blood pressure**, **glucose levels**, **healthy diet**, **appropriate energy intake**, **physical activity**, and **tobacco avoidance**.
2. **Very few individuals** meet all seven metrics of ideal cardiovascular health.
3. **Promotion of a healthy lifestyle** throughout life is the most important method to prevent **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
4. A **sedentary lifestyle**, **poor diet**, and **obesity** all contribute to increased cardiovascular risk.
5. Only **22.5% of adults** in the United States meet both **aerobic and strengthening exercise recommendations**.
6. Average daily fruit and vegetable consumption in the U.S. is **less than recommended**, with <1 cup of fruit (recommended: 1.5–2 cups) and <1.5 cups of vegetables (recommended: 2–3 cups).
7. In the **Diabetes Prevention Program**, interventions such as **diet change**, **exercise**, and **5%–7% weight loss** reduced the risk for diabetes by **58%** in high-risk individuals.
8. **Tobacco use** is the **leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death** in the United States.
9. After **15 years of tobacco cessation**, the **risk of heart failure and death** in former smokers approaches that of never smokers.
10. **Smoking status should be assessed at every clinical visit**, and **cessation counseling and pharmacologic therapy** should be offered to active smokers.
11. **Psychosocial factors** including **depression**, **anger**, and **anxiety** are associated with worse **cardiovascular outcomes**.
12. There is **no evidence** that **treating psychosocial disorders** improves **cardiovascular event risk**, although detection and management remain important for **overall health**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These metrics reflect the core goals of population-level cardiovascular prevention initiatives.
3. Lifestyle changes can impact multiple risk factors simultaneously, offering broad preventive benefits.
6. Suboptimal diet quality is a recognized modifiable risk factor contributing to national cardiovascular disease burden.
7. This landmark trial supports lifestyle intervention as a primary strategy for metabolic and cardiovascular risk reduction.
9. Tobacco cessation yields substantial long-term cardiovascular benefits, justifying aggressive intervention.
12. While mental health affects health behaviors and outcomes, its direct impact on ASCVD incidence is less clear.
