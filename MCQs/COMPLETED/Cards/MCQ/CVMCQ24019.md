### 🫠 Cardiovascular Risk: Metabolic Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Metabolic syndrome** is defined by the presence of any **three or more** of the following five conditions: **elevated glucose level**, **central obesity**, **low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level**, **elevated triglyceride level**, and **elevated blood pressure**.
2. **Metabolic syndrome** increases the risk for **type 2 diabetes mellitus**, **cardiovascular disease**, and **stroke**.
3. The hallmark feature of **metabolic syndrome** is **glucose intolerance**, but the diagnosis can be made even before confirmatory testing for **diabetes**, **prediabetes**, or **glucose intolerance**.
4. **Thiazide diuretics** may cause **minor elevations** in **total cholesterol**, **low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol**, or **triglycerides**, particularly at doses **greater than 50 mg/day**.
5. Low-dose **thiazide diuretics** are **not associated** with reduced **HDL cholesterol** levels.
6. **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)** is an inherited condition characterized by markedly elevated **LDL cholesterol** levels (often >200 mg/dL [5.18 mmol/L]), with **physical exam findings** (e.g., **xanthomas**, **xanthelasmas**, **corneal arcus**) and a **positive family history**.
7. The **lipid pattern** associated with **hypothyroidism** includes increased **total cholesterol**, **LDL cholesterol**, and **triglyceride** levels.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient meets criteria for metabolic syndrome with **central obesity**, **low HDL cholesterol**, **elevated triglycerides**, and **elevated blood pressure**.
4. The changes caused by thiazide diuretics are usually modest (5%–15%) and generally seen only at **higher dosages**.
6. This patient's **normal LDL cholesterol** and absence of characteristic findings make **familial hypercholesterolemia** unlikely.
7. The patient's **lipid pattern** (low HDL and elevated triglycerides) is **not typical** for **hypothyroidism**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **hallmark feature** of **metabolic syndrome** is **glucose intolerance**.
2. **Metabolic syndrome** is diagnosed by the presence of **three or more** of the following: **elevated glucose**, **central obesity**, **low HDL cholesterol**, **elevated triglycerides**, and **elevated blood pressure**.
3. From 2016 to 2018, the **prevalence of obesity** in the United States increased from **39.6% to 42.4%**, and **class III obesity (BMI >40)** increased from **7.7% to 9.2%**.
4. **Obesity** can increase the risk for **cardiovascular disease (CVD)** events **even in the absence** of metabolic risk factors.
5. Approximately **34% of adults** meet criteria for **metabolic syndrome**.
6. The risk of **cardiovascular disease** and **diabetes mellitus** increases as the **number of metabolic syndrome components** increases.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Although not required for diagnosis, **glucose intolerance** reflects the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance.
2. The diagnostic definition mirrors that provided by the **Endocrine Society**.
4. This indicates that **adiposity alone** may exert independent cardiovascular risk.
6. The relationship between **risk factor burden** and disease risk is **dose-dependent**.
