### 🫠 Cardiology: Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography for Chest Pain Evaluation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **worsening or new angina** should undergo **diagnostic testing and risk stratification** to guide therapy and prevent adverse cardiac events.  
2. **Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)** is recommended for adults **younger than 65 years** who have an **intermediate or high pre‑test probability of coronary artery disease (CAD)** when predominantly **non‑obstructive CAD** is expected.  
3. In the **emergency department**, a **CCTA‑based strategy** for acute chest pain **reduces time to diagnosis and enables earlier discharge** without compromising 1‑ to 6‑month safety outcomes when compared with a standard evaluation that includes stress testing.  
4. Indications for **CCTA** include a **prior inconclusive functional stress study**, suspicion of **anomalous coronary arteries**, and the need to evaluate the **aorta or pulmonary arteries**.  
5. **Adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging** is generally used for patients who **cannot exercise**, but it is **contraindicated** in **active bronchospasm**, **theophylline therapy**, **hypotension**, and **high‑degree atrioventricular block**.  
6. **Exercise stress echocardiography** is suboptimal when a patient **cannot achieve target heart rate** or when a **previous stress test was inconclusive**.  
7. **Invasive coronary angiography** is indicated for chest‑pain patients who are **high risk** according to validated scores such as **TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction)** or **GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events)**, or for those with **recurrent ischemic symptoms** or **significant left ventricular dysfunction**.  
8. **Fractional flow reserve (FFR)**—measured invasively or derived from CCTA as **fractional flow reserve computed tomography (FFR‑CT)**—quantifies the **hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis** and improves diagnostic specificity for obstructive CAD beyond anatomic imaging alone.  
9. Both **CCTA** and **invasive coronary angiography** provide **anatomic visualization of the epicardial coronary arteries**, but each requires **iodinated contrast** and exposes the patient to **ionizing radiation**.  
10. Interpretation of **CCTA** is limited in patients with **persistent tachycardia**, **extensive coronary calcification**, or **very small distal vessels**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Risk‑stratification tools help select patients for invasive versus noninvasive management and reduce missed diagnoses.
2. Younger patients have less coronary calcification, which improves CCTA image quality and diagnostic accuracy.
3. Randomized trials demonstrate equivalent rates of death, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina between CCTA and functional testing strategies.
4. These additional indications leverage CCTA’s high spatial resolution and wide field of view for thoracic imaging.
5. Adenosine’s bronchoconstrictive and hypotensive effects underlie its contraindications; **regadenoson** or **dobutamine stress testing** may be alternatives.
6. Adequate chronotropic response is essential for ischemia detection during stress echocardiography.
7. High‑risk criteria include elevated cardiac troponin, dynamic ECG changes, or a **GRACE score >140**.
8. **Instantaneous wave‑free ratio (iFR)** provides a hyperemia‑independent invasive assessment of lesion physiology.
9. Contrast‑induced nephropathy risk and cumulative radiation dose are important considerations when selecting an anatomic test.
10. Pre‑scan **β‑blockers** or **nitrates** can improve CCTA image quality in tachycardic patients.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In the **PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)** trial, symptomatic patients with suspected CAD who were evaluated with initial **CCTA** or **functional testing** experienced similarly **low composite cardiovascular event rates (<1 % per year)** and **no difference in 2‑year outcomes**.  
2. **Invasive coronary angiography** generates **two‑dimensional images of the coronary lumen** by injecting **non‑ionic contrast material** through **femoral, brachial, ulnar, or radial arterial access**.  
3. **FFR‑CT**, an **FDA‑approved** computational technique applied to CCTA datasets, provides combined **anatomic and functional assessment** of coronary lesions but is **limited by availability and analysis time** in acute presentations.  
4. **Instantaneous wave‑free ratio (iFR)** offers an **invasive physiologic assessment** of coronary stenosis severity **without pharmacologic vasodilation**.  
5. **CCTA** is reasonable for **intermediate‑risk patients** with acute chest pain, **no known CAD**, and a **negative or inconclusive acute coronary syndrome evaluation**, as it may reduce downstream testing and costs.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PROMISE enrolled nearly 10,000 patients with intermediate pre‑test probability of CAD and showed event rates <1 % per year in both study arms.  
2. Transradial access for coronary angiography is associated with fewer vascular complications than transfemoral access.  
3. **FFR‑CT** uses **computational fluid dynamics** to simulate hyperemic flow and calculate pressure gradients across stenoses.  
4. **iFR** measures the **resting diastolic wave‑free period**, avoiding the need for adenosine and reducing patient discomfort.  
5. Appropriate patient selection aims to minimize unnecessary hospital admissions, radiation exposure, and healthcare costs.
