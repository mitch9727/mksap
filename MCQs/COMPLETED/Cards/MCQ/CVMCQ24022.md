### 🫀 Acute Coronary Syndrome: High-Risk NSTEMI Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Invasive coronary angiography (ICA)** is recommended for patients with **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** who are designated as **high risk**.
2. High-risk ACS features include **older age**, **ECG abnormalities**, **ongoing chest pain**, **signs of heart failure**, and **elevated cardiac enzymes**.
3. Risk stratification tools such as the **HEART** (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and initial Troponin), **GRACE** (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), or **TIMI** (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) scores help classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk.
4. In high-risk **non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)** with ongoing ischemia, **functional testing** (e.g., **adenosine cardiac magnetic resonance stress test**) is **inappropriate** due to risk of vasodilatation and delays in revascularization.
5. **Fractional flow reserve computed tomography (FFR-CT)** combined with **coronary CT angiography** is not validated in patients with **acute chest pain** and ongoing ischemia and should not be used in this setting.
6. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is useful during hospitalization for assessing **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)** and regional wall motion, but is not appropriate as initial management in high-risk NSTEMI.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ICA enables early identification of culprit lesions and facilitates timely revascularization, improving outcomes in high-risk ACS patients.
2. These features correlate with poor prognosis and guide the urgency of invasive intervention.
3. These scoring systems help standardize risk stratification and guide clinical decision-making in the emergency setting.
4. Functional testing is reserved for stable or lower-risk patients to avoid delaying definitive therapy.
5. FFR-CT is designed for stable coronary artery disease assessment and has not been tested in emergent ischemic settings.
6. TTE is important for risk assessment but does not address coronary anatomy or provide revascularization options.
