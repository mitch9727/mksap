### 🫠 Cardiovascular Testing: Medication Management Before Stress Echocardiography

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The decision to withhold **cardiac medications** before **exercise or pharmaceutical stress testing** should be **tailored to individual patient circumstances**.
2. If the indication for stress testing is to assess **the efficacy of current therapy** in a patient on **β-blockers** or **nitrates**, these medications **can be continued**.
3. Continuing **β-blockers** such as **carvedilol** allows evaluation of a patient’s **response to stress while on their usual medical regimen**.
4. **Caffeine** and other **methylxanthines** should be **withheld for 12 hours** before **vasodilator stress testing** with agents like **adenosine** or **regadenoson**.
5. It is **not necessary to withhold caffeine** before **exercise stress echocardiography**.
6. Holding **β-blockers** before a stress test may represent a **de-escalation of medical therapy** and is **not recommended** in patients with **stable angina** on **maximal medical therapy**.
7. Initiating a **long-acting nitrate** before stress testing may **mask ischemia** and is **not indicated**.
8. **Nitrates** are **contraindicated** in patients taking **phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors**, such as **sildenafil**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Medication management may vary depending on whether the test is for diagnosis, risk stratification, or assessment of treatment response.
2. This is particularly relevant when deciding if invasive coronary angiography is needed.
3. A prior adequate stress test while on therapy suggests current regimens do not prevent an appropriate heart rate response.
4. Methylxanthines block adenosine A2A receptors and may reduce vasodilator efficacy.
6. Stress test sensitivity is not meaningfully improved by withholding β-blockers in most patients.
7. Pharmacologic vasodilation or myocardial ischemia may not be appropriately unmasked if a nitrate is newly added.
8. Combining nitrates with PDE5 inhibitors may result in life-threatening hypotension.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac stress testing** is most effective in patients with an **intermediate pretest probability (10–90%)** of **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
2. In patients with a **low pretest probability** of CAD, stress testing often results in **false-positive findings** and **unnecessary downstream testing**.
3. In patients with a **high pretest probability** of CAD, **invasive coronary angiography** may be more appropriate than stress testing.
4. **Exercise stress testing** is preferred over **pharmacologic stress testing** unless **exercise is contraindicated or not feasible**.
5. **Cardiac medications** that impair **heart rate response** (e.g., **β-blockers**) should be **withheld for 24 hours** before **diagnostic exercise stress testing** to improve sensitivity.
6. **Cardioactive medications** should be **continued** if the purpose of the test is to assess **symptom control**, **therapy efficacy**, or **prognosis** in patients with **known CAD**.
7. The “**warranty period**” of a **normal, adequate stress test** is **1 year** in patients with unchanged symptoms.
8. **Achieving 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate** or a **rate-pressure product ≥25,000** is considered an **adequate stress test workload**.
9. **Horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression ≥1 mm** occurring **80 milliseconds after the J point** is indicative of **ischemia** on **exercise ECG**.
10. A **heart rate recovery <12 beats/min** in the first minute after exercise is associated with **increased mortality**.
11. The **Duke Treadmill Score** combines exercise duration, symptom development, and ST depression to estimate **5-year mortality** in patients without known CAD.
12. **Stress echocardiography** detects **new wall motion abnormalities** as indicators of **ischemia**, and persistent resting abnormalities may suggest **hibernating or infarcted myocardium**.
13. **Dobutamine stress echocardiography** aims to achieve **85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate**, with **atropine** used as needed.
14. In patients with **left bundle branch block (LBBB)** or **paced rhythm**, **exercise is preferred** over **dobutamine** stress echocardiography.
15. A **perfusion defect on SPECT imaging** that is present both **at rest and after stress** suggests an **infarct or hibernating myocardium**.
16. **Left ventricular (LV) dilation after stress** on **SPECT or stress echocardiography** with a normal resting study may indicate **balanced ischemia** or **multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
17. A **wall motion abnormality** induced by stress on **echocardiography**, in the setting of a **normal resting wall motion**, is indicative of **stress-induced myocardial ischemia**.
18. On **SPECT myocardial viability testing**, **reperfusion of a previously hypoperfused area** after delayed thallium rest imaging suggests **viable myocardium**.
19. A **biphasic response to dobutamine** on echocardiographic viability testing (improvement at low dose, worsening at high dose) is consistent with **viable myocardium**.
20. On **positron emission tomography (PET)** viability imaging, a **perfusion defect with preserved metabolic activity** indicates **viable myocardium**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Intermediate pretest probability is the optimal zone for influencing post-test probability.
2. Young patients with atypical chest pain often fall in this low-likelihood category.
3. Invasive angiography may be a better option when pretest probability is high and CAD is suspected.
4. Exercise testing provides functional and prognostic data not obtained with pharmacologic testing.
5. β-Blockers blunt the heart rate response, potentially leading to nondiagnostic testing.
6. Symptom-driven testing reflects real-world performance under therapy.
7. A normal stress test predicts low cardiac event risk for about 1 year.
8. Rate pressure product reflects myocardial oxygen demand and test adequacy.
9. ST-segment depression on stress ECG suggests myocardial ischemia, though it lacks localization.
10. Heart rate recovery is a marker of autonomic function and cardiovascular fitness.
11. The Duke Score stratifies patients into low, intermediate, or high risk of death.
12. Stress echo detects ischemia earlier than ECG alone and helps localize affected territories.
13. Atropine is added if maximal heart rate is not achieved with dobutamine alone.
14. LBBB causes baseline ECG and wall motion artifacts that may confound pharmacologic testing.
15. Fixed perfusion defects imply scarred, nonviable tissue, while hibernating myocardium may regain function after revascularization.
16. Balanced ischemia refers to uniform subendocardial ischemia that may not show focal perfusion defects.
17. Stress-induced wall motion abnormalities reflect regional myocardial dysfunction due to inadequate perfusion.
18. Thallium rest redistribution imaging evaluates delayed perfusion recovery to distinguish viable from infarcted tissue.
19. The biphasic response pattern is highly specific for identifying dysfunctional but recoverable myocardium.
20. Preserved glucose metabolism in areas of reduced perfusion on PET suggests myocardial hibernation rather than scar.
