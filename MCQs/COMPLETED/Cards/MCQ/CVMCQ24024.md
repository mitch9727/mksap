### 🫀 Cardiovascular Medicine: Exercise Stress Echocardiography for Stable Chest Pain

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **stable chest pain** and an **intermediate pre‑test probability of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD)**, **exercise stress echocardiography (ESE)** is an appropriate initial diagnostic test.  
2. **Exercise‑based stress testing** is preferred over **pharmacologic stress testing** (for example, with dobutamine or vasodilator agents) unless the patient is unable to exercise.  
3. Key exercise‑test metrics—including **exercise capacity**, **heart‑rate recovery**, and **blood‑pressure response**—carry strong prognostic value for **future cardiovascular outcomes**.  
4. **Dobutamine stress echocardiography** is a reasonable alternative when exercise is not feasible, but it offers less prognostic information than exercise‑based testing.  
5. **Invasive coronary angiography (ICA)** is generally reserved for patients in whom **high‑risk features** are identified on non‑invasive testing and is not usually a first‑line test in stable chest pain.  
6. Hyperemic **vasodilator myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)** with agents such as **regadenoson** is preferred over exercise‑ or dobutamine‑based stress testing in patients with a **left bundle branch block (LBBB)** because it lowers the rate of **false‑positive septal perfusion defects**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient in the vignette has typical angina symptoms, is capable of exercising, and therefore meets criteria for an exercise‑based imaging test instead of pharmacologic stress or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).  
2. Typical contraindications to exercise testing include severe orthopedic limitation, advanced pulmonary disease, or significant neurologic impairment.  
3. Adverse exercise findings include **low exercise capacity (<5 metabolic equivalents [METs])**, **heart‑rate recovery ≤ 12 beats/min during the first minute of recovery**, and **exercise‑induced hypotension**.  
4. Dobutamine increases myocardial oxygen demand to provoke ischemia but does not allow assessment of exercise capacity or autonomic recovery.  
5. ICA involves procedural risk and is generally performed only after abnormal non‑invasive testing or when high‑risk coronary anatomy is strongly suspected.  
6. Vasodilator agents shorten coronary transit time independent of heart‑rate changes and minimize conduction‑related perfusion artifacts in LBBB.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) is a reasonable diagnostic test in patients with normal findings on baseline ECG and no disabling comorbid conditions.
2. Stress testing with adjunctive imaging or anatomic assessment with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is indicated in patients with baseline ECG abnormalities.
3. Achieving 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate during stress testing is adequate to identify obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
4. Exercise ECG identifies ischemia by development of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm occurring 80 milliseconds after the J point.
5. Heart rate recovery of less than 12 beats per minute in the first minute after cessation of exercise is associated with higher mortality.
6. The Duke Treadmill Score incorporates exercise duration, symptom development, and ST-segment depression to estimate 5-year mortality in patients without known CAD.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Disabling comorbidities include frailty, morbid obesity, peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or orthopedic limitations.
2. Baseline ECG abnormalities include left bundle branch block (LBBB), ST-segment depression >1 mm, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, or preexcitation.
3. The rate pressure product (heart rate × systolic blood pressure) is also used to assess workload.
4. Exercise-induced ST changes on ECG cannot localize ischemia or suggest the culprit vessel.
5. Heart rate recovery adds incremental prognostic information to treadmill test findings.
6. This scoring system is widely used in risk stratification of patients without established coronary disease.
