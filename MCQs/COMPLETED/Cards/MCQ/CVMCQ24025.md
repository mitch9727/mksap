### 🫀 Cardiology: Management After Low-Risk Exercise Treadmill Test

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The Duke Treadmill Score (DTS) incorporates exercise duration, symptom development, and degree of ST-segment depression to calculate 5-year mortality in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD).
2. Exercise treadmill test findings that suggest a poor prognosis include degree of ST-segment depression, short duration of exercise, slow heart rate recovery, blood pressure drop during stress, and development of exercise-limiting symptoms.
3. Patients with low-risk exercise treadmill test results may undergo a trial of guideline-directed medical therapy without invasive coronary angiography.
4. Coronary angiography is indicated for patients with a high-risk treadmill test result who may benefit from revascularization or if medical therapy has failed.
5. Exercise stress echocardiography is a first-line test to evaluate patients with an intermediate probability of CAD or when exercise treadmill test results are equivocal.
6. Vasodilator agents such as regadenoson and adenosine are used for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients who are unable to exercise or have contraindications to exercise.
7. There is no indication to perform further stress testing, including MPI, in patients with a low-risk exercise treadmill test result and no limiting symptoms.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The DTS is a validated risk stratification tool for patients undergoing exercise testing without known CAD.
2. Poor prognostic indicators are used to identify patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events or mortality.
3. Low-risk patients typically have excellent exercise capacity, normal hemodynamic response, and rapid heart rate recovery.
4. This applies when the treadmill test shows high-risk features such as significant ST-segment changes or symptoms.
5. This modality adds imaging to better identify ischemia when standard exercise ECG results are indeterminate.
6. Regadenoson is preferred when exercise is not feasible due to comorbidities or limitations.
7. Further testing would not yield additional diagnostic value and could lead to unnecessary procedures.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) is a reasonable diagnostic test in patients with normal findings on baseline ECG and no disabling comorbid conditions.
2. Stress testing with adjunctive imaging or anatomic assessment with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is indicated in patients with baseline ECG abnormalities.
3. Achieving 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate during stress testing is adequate to identify obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
4. Exercise ECG identifies ischemia by development of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm occurring 80 milliseconds after the J point.
5. Heart rate recovery of less than 12 beats per minute in the first minute after cessation of exercise is associated with higher mortality.
6. The Duke Treadmill Score incorporates exercise duration, symptom development, and ST-segment depression to estimate 5-year mortality in patients without known CAD.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Disabling comorbidities include frailty, morbid obesity, peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or orthopedic limitations.
2. Baseline ECG abnormalities include left bundle branch block (LBBB), ST-segment depression >1 mm, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, or preexcitation.
3. The rate pressure product (heart rate × systolic blood pressure) is also used to assess workload.
4. Exercise-induced ST changes on ECG cannot localize ischemia or suggest the culprit vessel.
5. Heart rate recovery adds incremental prognostic information to treadmill test findings.
6. This scoring system is widely used in risk stratification of patients without established coronary disease.
