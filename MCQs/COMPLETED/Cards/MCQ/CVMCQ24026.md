### 🫠 Cardiomyopathy: Cardiac Amyloidosis Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **99m‑Technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc‑PYP) scintigraphy** is a diagnostic imaging test that specifically identifies **cardiac amyloidosis** caused by **transthyretin (ATTR) protein** deposition.
2. The two most common forms of **cardiac amyloidosis** are **amyloid light‑chain (AL) amyloidosis**, in which amyloid fibrils consist of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains, and **ATTR amyloidosis**, in which fibrils consist of transthyretin.
3. Echocardiographic findings that suggest **cardiac amyloidosis** include **increased left ventricular wall thickness**, **grade 2 or higher diastolic dysfunction**, and an **apical‑sparing global longitudinal strain pattern**.
4. On **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **cardiac amyloidosis** may manifest as **low‑voltage QRS complexes** despite increased left ventricular wall thickness.
5. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** that demonstrates **diffuse late gadolinium enhancement** is highly suggestive of **cardiac amyloidosis** but cannot distinguish between AL and ATTR subtypes.
6. Evaluation for **AL amyloidosis** requires testing for a **monoclonal gammopathy** with **serum and urine immunofixation and free light‑chain assay**.
7. **Cardiac amyloidosis** should be suspected when an echocardiogram shows **increased wall thickness** in conjunction with a **low‑voltage ECG**.
8. **Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET)** myocardial perfusion imaging is useful for assessing **coronary artery disease** but has **no role** in diagnosing **cardiac amyloidosis**.
9. **Stress echocardiography** is indicated for ischemia or hemodynamic assessment but is **not useful** for evaluating suspected **cardiac amyloidosis**.
10. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is reserved for specific indications (such as infective endocarditis, prosthetic valve assessment, acute aortic pathology, or left atrial thrombus) and is **not indicated** for diagnosing **cardiac amyloidosis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. 99mTc‑PYP binds to myocardial ATTR amyloid deposits; positive cardiac uptake in the absence of a monoclonal protein essentially confirms ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.
2. Distinguishing AL from ATTR is crucial because AL amyloidosis requires prompt chemotherapy‑based treatment, whereas ATTR is managed with transthyretin stabilizers and gene‑silencing therapies.
3. The “apical‑sparing” strain pattern appears as relative preservation of longitudinal strain at the apex and correlates with amyloid infiltration of the basal and mid‑segments.
4. Low‑voltage ECG despite ventricular wall thickening reflects electrical dampening by interstitial amyloid deposition.
5. CMR findings support the diagnosis when echocardiography is equivocal, but tissue characterization cannot specify the amyloid subtype.
6. Identifying a monoclonal gammopathy differentiates AL from ATTR and guides subsequent hematologic evaluation.
8. PET tracers do not bind amyloid fibrils; therefore, PET perfusion imaging cannot detect amyloid infiltration.
9. Stress echocardiography does not improve diagnostic yield for amyloidosis and exposes the patient to unnecessary testing in this context.
10. TEE offers no additional information about myocardial infiltration and carries procedural risks not justified for suspected amyloidosis alone.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Diagnostic testing for structural heart disease should be considered in patients with a suggestive history and physical examination findings, such as **heart failure symptoms**, **grade 3/6 or louder systolic murmurs**, **diastolic or continuous murmurs**, or murmurs associated with **exertional dyspnea, light-headedness, or chest pain**.

15. **Esophageal injury**, including **perforation and bleeding**, is a rare complication of TEE.
16. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** imaging can evaluate **myocardial and pericardial disease**, especially **inflammatory and infiltrative cardiomyopathies**.
17. CMR is particularly useful for **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** with **eccentric or apical hypertrophy** not well seen on echocardiography.
18. CMR can serve as an **alternative to TEE** for assessing **valvular pathology** when **TTE is inadequate**.
19. TTE findings may raise suspicion for **cardiac amyloidosis**, but diagnosis requires **CMR or tissue biopsy**.

23. **Intravenous agitated saline** is **normally cleared by the pulmonary circulation** unless there is a **right-to-left intracardiac shunt**.
24. **TEE probe placement** occurs in the **distal esophagus and stomach**, providing proximity to posterior cardiac structures.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Murmurs with concerning characteristics or symptoms increase the pretest probability for structural abnormalities.
2. A clinical change warrants imaging to reassess anatomy and function.
3. This is aligned with adult congenital and valvular disease guidelines.
4. TTE is often the first-line diagnostic test for suspected structural heart disease.
5. Chamber dimensions and wall thickness are essential parameters in cardiomyopathy evaluation.
6. TTE assesses pericardial space for effusion and valvular leaflets for regurgitation or stenosis.
7. Agitated saline contrast reveals right-to-left shunts when bubbles bypass pulmonary filtration.
8. Dobutamine improves contractility, aiding in identifying flow-limiting stenosis under stress.
9. POCUS is a rapid bedside screening tool in emergency or critical care settings.
10. TEE is more sensitive than TTE for small vegetations and paravalvular abscesses.
11. TEE offers better resolution for surgical planning.
12. Acoustic shadowing from devices (e.g., prosthetic valves) limits TTE utility.
13. Visualization of LAA is critical before restoring sinus rhythm (see Figure 1).
14. Sedation and probe passage can worsen preexisting esophageal pathology.
15. Although rare, serious complications from TEE must be considered in risk-benefit analysis.
16. CMR can differentiate myocarditis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and pericardial constriction.
17. CMR offers superior apical resolution and detects variants not seen in standard echo windows.
18. CMR provides a noninvasive alternative when TEE is high risk or poorly tolerated.
19. Echocardiographic features of amyloidosis include thickened walls and granular appearance.
20. Differentiating AL from ATTR amyloidosis is critical because treatment strategies differ.
21. Bone tracer uptake by myocardium is characteristic of transthyretin amyloid infiltration (see Figure 2).
22. Inferior vena cava diameter collapsibility provides a bedside estimate of right atrial pressure or preload.
23. In a normal heart, microbubbles from agitated saline do not cross into the left heart due to pulmonary filtration.
24. This anatomic positioning allows TEE to image posterior valves (mitral, left atrial appendage) in high resolution.
25. This is valuable in structural heart disease where echocardiographic windows are limited or obstructed.
26. Cardiac uptake greater than bone uptake strongly supports transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis.
