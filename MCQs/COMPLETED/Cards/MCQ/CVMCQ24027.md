### 🫠 Dyslipidemia: High-Intensity Statin Therapy in ASCVD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **High-intensity statin therapy** with either **atorvastatin** or **rosuvastatin** is standard of care for patients with **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**, including **prior myocardial infarction**.
2. **Presence of ASCVD alone**—including **coronary**, **cerebrovascular**, or **peripheral arterial disease**—is sufficient to initiate **statin therapy**, regardless of **low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** level.
3. In **secondary prevention** of ASCVD, the **goal of statin therapy** is a **≥50% reduction in LDL cholesterol** and an **LDL level <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)**.
4. **Ezetimibe** should be added to **maximally tolerated statin therapy** in ASCVD patients if there is **<50% LDL reduction** or **LDL ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)**.
5. In **very high-risk ASCVD patients**—defined as having **multiple major ASCVD events** or **one event plus multiple risk factors**—the goal **LDL level is <55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L)**.
6. **High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)** testing is used to guide **initial statin therapy** in borderline-risk patients, but not in those with **established ASCVD**.
7. **Rosuvastatin** and **atorvastatin** are both appropriate high-intensity statins, and switching between them is not necessary if LDL goals are achieved.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient's **LDL cholesterol dropped by more than 50%** with **high-dose rosuvastatin**, indicating appropriate secondary prevention.
4. Nonstatin agents like **ezetimibe** are reserved for patients not meeting **LDL targets** despite **maximally tolerated statin therapy**.
5. This patient lacks **very high-risk features**, such as multiple ASCVD events or multiple comorbidities, so the **<55 mg/dL goal** does not apply.
6. **hs-CRP ≥0.2 mg/dL (2.0 mg/L)** can aid in **primary prevention risk discussions**, not required in **secondary prevention**.
7. Both statins are considered **equivalent options** for ASCVD when dosed at high intensity.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Secondary prevention statin therapy** is appropriate for patients with **acute coronary syndrome**, **myocardial infarction**, **angina**, **coronary revascularization**, **stroke**, **transient ischemic attack**, **peripheral artery disease**, or **aortic aneurysm**.
2. **High-intensity statin therapy** should be initiated in ASCVD patients **aged ≤75 years** to achieve **≥50% LDL reduction**.
3. If **high-intensity statin therapy** is not tolerated, **moderate-intensity statins** should be used to achieve **30–49% LDL reduction**.
4. If LDL goals are not met with statins alone, **ezetimibe** is the **first-line nonstatin** to add.
5. If further LDL reduction is needed, **PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies** may be considered, especially now that their **cost-effectiveness** has improved.
6. **Very high-risk ASCVD patients** may require **ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors** if LDL remains above **55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L)** despite maximal statin therapy.
7. The **American Diabetes Association (ADA)** recommends **high-intensity statins** for all patients with **diabetes and ASCVD**, with escalation to **ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors** as needed.
8. The **VA/DoD cholesterol guidelines** recommend **at least moderate-intensity statins** in all ASCVD patients, and **high-intensity therapy** in those at higher risk.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These conditions define the population eligible for **secondary prevention** lipid-lowering therapy.
2. The **<75 age threshold** aligns with trial inclusion criteria and balances benefit vs. tolerability.
5. **PCSK9 inhibitors** are now **more accessible** due to cost reductions, increasing their use in refractory hyperlipidemia.
7. The ADA aligns with ACC/AHA in using **LDL response thresholds** to guide therapy.
8. Higher-risk patients in VA/DoD include those with **recent MI/ACS**, **stroke recurrence**, or **CVD with other risk factors**.
