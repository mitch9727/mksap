### 🫠 Cardiovascular Risk: ASCVD Risk Estimation and Primary Prevention

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All adults aged **40 to 75 years** should undergo **lipid screening** to calculate the **10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
2. The **10-year ASCVD risk** should be calculated using the **American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Pooled Cohort Equations**, even if **low-density lipoprotein (LDL)** and **high-density lipoprotein (HDL)** cholesterol levels are in the normal or desirable range.
3. **Statin therapy** is indicated in patients with a **≥20% calculated 10-year ASCVD risk**, those with **diabetes mellitus**, or those with **LDL cholesterol >190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L)**.
4. In patients with **borderline (5% to <7.5%)** or **intermediate (≥7.5% to <20%) ASCVD risk**, **statin therapy** may be considered based on the presence of **additional risk-enhancing factors**.
5. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **against low-dose aspirin** for the **primary prevention of ASCVD** in adults aged **60 years and older**.
6. In patients with **low 10-year ASCVD risk**, **repeat lipid screening** at **3 to 5 years** is reasonable.
7. **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)** testing is not routinely used to calculate **ASCVD risk** but may be used as a **risk-enhancing factor** in select cases.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Lipid screening supports risk stratification and preventive management, even in asymptomatic individuals.
2. These pooled cohort equations incorporate age, sex, race, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status, and smoking.
3. These groups are considered to have sufficiently high cardiovascular risk to benefit clearly from statin therapy.
4. Shared decision-making should incorporate other factors like family history, metabolic syndrome, or elevated hsCRP.
5. Aspirin is associated with bleeding risks that outweigh its benefits in this age group.
6. For very low-risk individuals, exact timing for repeat testing is flexible but 3–5 years is a general guide.
7. ABI is typically reserved for patients with leg symptoms suggestive of peripheral artery disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Elevated **low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** is strongly associated with increased risk for **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
2. **LDL cholesterol** is the **most atherogenic lipoprotein**, and its measurement is primarily used to identify patients without known ASCVD who may benefit from **risk-lowering interventions**.
3. The **AHA/ACC cholesterol management guidelines** recommend initiating **fixed-dose statin therapy** in patients with **ASCVD**, regardless of the **LDL cholesterol level**, along with lifestyle modification.
4. In patients with **elevated LDL cholesterol**, potential **secondary causes** such as **hypothyroidism**, **poorly controlled diabetes mellitus**, **nephrotic syndrome**, or medications (e.g., **glucocorticoids**, **diuretics**, **amiodarone**) should be considered.
5. **Genetic testing** for **familial hypercholesterolemia** may be considered in adults with **LDL cholesterol >250 mg/dL (6.48 mmol/L)** or **LDL >190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L)** with a **first-degree relative** with premature **coronary artery disease (CAD)** or similar hypercholesterolemia.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The causal role of LDL cholesterol in atherosclerosis is supported by both epidemiologic and clinical trial evidence.
2. Risk stratification allows appropriate selection of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies.
3. Statin intensity may vary, but treatment initiation is based on risk category, not a target LDL level.
4. Identifying reversible causes of high LDL can prevent unnecessary treatment or reveal contributing disease.
5. Family history plays a crucial role in evaluating possible monogenic dyslipidemias like familial hypercholesterolemia.
