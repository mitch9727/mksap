### 🫀 Cardiovascular Medicine: Statin Monitoring in Asymptomatic Patients

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Statins** are first-line therapy for managing **dyslipidemia** for both primary and secondary prevention of **cardiovascular events**.
2. Routine laboratory monitoring of **statin therapy** in the absence of symptoms is **not indicated**.
3. No additional laboratory testing is needed in **asymptomatic patients** receiving **statin therapy**, aside from a follow-up **lipid panel**.
4. **Creatine kinase (CK)** testing is not indicated in the absence of **muscular symptoms**.
5. The incidence of **statin-associated muscle symptoms** is no greater than **1%**, and **myopathy/rhabdomyolysis** occurs in less than **0.1%**, based on randomized trial data.
6. A systematic review found only a **3% relative increase** in **myalgias** among patients taking statins compared with placebo.
7. **Hemoglobin A1c** testing is not required in asymptomatic patients on statins without other **diabetes risk factors**.
8. **Aminotransferase elevations** occur in approximately **1%** of patients taking statins and are usually asymptomatic and dose-related.
9. **Liver injury** from statins occurs in fewer than **0.001%** of patients.
10. **Liver chemistry tests** should be checked at **baseline** when initiating statin therapy, but not during routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Statins reduce **LDL cholesterol** and improve outcomes in cardiovascular disease prevention.
2. This recommendation aligns with **high-value care** principles to avoid unnecessary testing.
3. The follow-up lipid panel already ordered is sufficient for ongoing monitoring.
4. CK is useful only when there is **clinical suspicion** of myopathy.
5. Observational studies report higher rates, but these may overestimate true risk.
6. This reflects minimal increased risk for muscle pain attributable to statins.
7. The risk of **type 2 diabetes mellitus** from statins is mainly in patients with **obesity** or other risk factors.
8. Elevations are typically **transient** and resolve without intervention.
9. Statin-induced liver injury is **extremely rare**.
10. Routine monitoring has **not been shown to improve outcomes** in asymptomatic patients.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **lipid panel** should be obtained **4 to 12 weeks after initiation** of lipid-lowering therapy.
2. If treatment goals are not achieved, assess **medication adherence** and **lifestyle modifications**.
3. Once LDL cholesterol goals are met, **lipid levels** should be monitored every **3 to 12 months** as indicated.
4. **Liver chemistry tests** should be obtained **before starting statin therapy**.
5. Routine **liver chemistry and muscle enzyme tests** are **not recommended** during therapy unless symptoms develop.
6. **Statin-related liver injury** occurs in less than **0.001%** of patients.
7. **Statin-associated myopathy or rhabdomyolysis** occurs in less than **0.1%** of patients.
8. **Type 2 diabetes mellitus risk** increases by **approximately 0.2% per year**, mostly in patients with **existing risk factors**.
9. **Statin intolerance** can often be addressed by **switching agents**, reducing the **dose or frequency**, or trying **nonstatin therapy**.
10. **Drug-drug interactions** with statins may increase **plasma levels**, elevating the risk of **myopathy** and **rhabdomyolysis**.
11. All **statins are contraindicated in pregnancy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This test determines whether patients are responding to therapy appropriately.
2. Lifestyle and medication changes may enhance LDL reduction.
3. Follow-up frequency should be tailored to patient risk and response.
4. Baseline levels help identify preexisting liver disease.
5. Testing during therapy is useful only if the patient has **symptoms suggestive of liver or muscle injury**.
6. This supports the safety of routine statin use.
7. These rare side effects should be distinguished from common nonspecific myalgias.
8. Statin-related diabetes risk is **clinically small** and usually limited to high-risk groups.
9. Many patients reporting side effects can tolerate another statin.
10. Examples include interactions with **fibrates** or **dabigatran**.
11. Statins may harm fetal development and should be avoided during pregnancy.
