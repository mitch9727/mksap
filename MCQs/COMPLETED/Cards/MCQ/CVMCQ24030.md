### 🫠 Lipid Disorders: Hypertriglyceridemia in Secondary ASCVD Prevention

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Persistently elevated triglycerides** are an independent risk factor for **future adverse cardiovascular events** in patients with **known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
2. **Icosapent ethyl**, a purified formulation of **eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)**, can be added to **statin therapy** for **secondary prevention** of cardiovascular events in patients with **fasting triglyceride levels >150 mg/dL (1.70 mmol/L)**.
3. In the **REDUCE-IT trial**, adding **icosapent ethyl** to statin therapy reduced the risk of **major cardiovascular events** by **25%** compared with placebo.
4. The **U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/U.S. Department of Defense** guidelines recommend adding **icosapent ethyl** to **maximally tolerated statin therapy** in patients with **elevated triglycerides** and known ASCVD.
5. **Bile acid sequestrants** such as **cholestyramine** are primarily used to **lower LDL cholesterol** and may cause a **modest increase in triglyceride levels**.
6. **Fibrates**, such as **gemfibrozil**, are appropriate for patients with **severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides >500 mg/dL [5.65 mmol/L])** at risk for **acute pancreatitis**, but do **not reduce cardiovascular events** and may increase **myopathy risk** when combined with statins.
7. **Niacin** lowers **triglyceride levels by 25–30%** and raises **HDL cholesterol**, but it does **not improve cardiovascular outcomes** beyond statin therapy and is often **poorly tolerated**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Icosapent ethyl is used as an adjunct to statins in patients with elevated triglycerides despite optimal LDL control.
3. The REDUCE-IT trial included patients with ASCVD or diabetes plus other risk factors.
5. Cholestyramine is not appropriate for triglyceride lowering and can worsen hypertriglyceridemia.
6. Gemfibrozil is contraindicated in patients who require ongoing statin therapy due to elevated myopathy risk.
7. Niacin's use is limited by gastrointestinal and flushing side effects.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **High-intensity statin therapy** should be initiated in patients **aged ≤75 years with ASCVD** to achieve a reduction in **LDL cholesterol of ≥50%**.
2. If **high-intensity statin therapy** is contraindicated or not tolerated, **moderate-intensity statin therapy** should be initiated to achieve a reduction in **LDL cholesterol of 30% to 49%**.
3. If **LDL cholesterol remains ≥70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)** despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, **ezetimibe** should be added.
4. If **LDL cholesterol goals** are still unmet, then a **PCSK9 monoclonal antibody** may be considered.
5. Patients with **multiple major ASCVD events** or **one major ASCVD event plus multiple high-risk conditions** are considered **very high risk** and may benefit from **nonstatin therapies** when LDL goals are unmet.
6. **Bempedoic acid** or **inclisiran** may be considered if LDL goals are not achieved with **statin, ezetimibe, and/or PCSK9 inhibitor** therapy.
7. The **American Diabetes Association (ADA)** recommends **high-intensity statin therapy** for all patients with **ASCVD and diabetes**.
8a. The ADA also supports adding **ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies** if LDL remains **≥55 mg/dL (1.42 mmol/L)** or fails to decline by **≥50%**.
8b. **High-intensity statin therapy** should be initiated in patients **aged ≤75 years with ASCVD** to achieve an **LDL cholesterol reduction ≥50%**.
9. **Moderate-intensity statin therapy** is recommended for **primary prevention** in patients with **LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L)**, **diabetes mellitus**, or a **10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ≥12%**.
10. **High-intensity statin therapy** is suggested for **higher-risk patients** for **secondary prevention** of cardiovascular events.
11. Adding **ezetimibe** or a **proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor** to **statin therapy** is suggested in **higher-risk patients** for **secondary prevention**.
12. Adding **icosapent ethyl** to statin therapy is suggested for **secondary prevention** in patients with **fasting triglyceride levels >150 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L)**.
13. **Niacin** is not recommended for **primary or secondary prevention** of cardiovascular disease.
14. **Fibrates** are suggested against for use with statin therapy in **primary or secondary prevention**.
15. **Omega-3 fatty acid supplements** (excluding icosapent ethyl) are suggested against for **primary or secondary prevention** of cardiovascular disease.
16. **Routine lipid monitoring** is suggested against in patients receiving **statin therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines form the basis of this recommendation.
3. Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption and is well tolerated.
4. PCSK9 inhibitors significantly reduce LDL but have historically been cost-limiting; prices have recently declined.
5. High-risk conditions include diabetes, hypertension, smoking, or chronic kidney disease.
6. These agents offer newer mechanisms of action for LDL lowering.
8a. These LDL thresholds are more aggressive in diabetes due to higher baseline cardiovascular risk.
10. Higher-risk patients include those with **recent myocardial infarction**, **acute coronary syndrome**, **stroke**, or established **cardiovascular disease** with additional risk factors.
11. Shared decision-making is emphasized for adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in patients willing to intensify therapy.
12. This applies only to patients with **persistently elevated triglycerides** despite statin use, not to the general population.
13. Niacin's adverse effect profile and lack of added benefit over statins limit its clinical use.
14. Fibrates have not shown consistent cardiovascular benefit and may increase adverse effects when combined with statins.
15. Over-the-counter omega-3 supplements lack the clinical trial evidence seen with purified agents like **icosapent ethyl**.
16. Routine monitoring is not required unless there are **changes in clinical status**, **adherence concerns**, or **drug safety issues**.
