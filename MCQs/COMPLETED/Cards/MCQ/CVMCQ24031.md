### 🫀 Dyslipidemia: Screening for Dyslipidemia

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Screening blood cholesterol levels** identifies individuals at increased risk for **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** who may benefit from primary prevention with **statin therapy**.  
2. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **universal lipid screening** for adults aged **40 to 75 years** and calculation of 10‑year ASCVD risk using the **American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Pooled Cohort Equations**.  
3. The **2018 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol** emphasizes **lifetime ASCVD risk estimation** in children, adolescents, and adults and promotes lifestyle risk reduction across the age spectrum.  
4. Patients with a calculated **10‑year ASCVD risk ≥5 %** (at least “borderline risk”) should be considered for initiation of **statin therapy**.  
5. In adults at **intermediate 10‑year ASCVD risk (7.5 %–<20 %)** with uncertainty about statin therapy, **coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring** refines risk: a **CAC score of 0** may defer statin therapy (unless higher‑risk features are present), whereas a **CAC score ≥100** strongly favors statin initiation.  
6. Among intermediate‑risk patients who remain undecided about statins, measuring **risk‑enhancing biomarkers** such as **high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP)**, **lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]**, and **apolipoprotein B** can further clarify ASCVD risk and inform treatment decisions.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Primary prevention trials and guideline recommendations link cholesterol screening to reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  
2. The Pooled Cohort Equations incorporate age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking status to estimate 10‑year ASCVD risk.  
3. Early identification of elevated lifetime risk facilitates counseling on diet, exercise, and weight management beginning in childhood.  
4. “Borderline‑risk” corresponds to a 10‑year ASCVD risk of **5 %–<7.5 %** in guideline terminology.  
5. CAC scoring provides a direct measure of subclinical atherosclerosis and is most helpful when treatment decisions remain uncertain after traditional risk assessment.  
6. Elevations in these biomarkers reclassify some patients to a higher risk category and strengthen the rationale for statin therapy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **AHA PREVENT equations** provide **sex‑specific, race‑free ASCVD risk prediction** as an alternative to the Pooled Cohort Equations.  
2. The **AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline** does **not limit lipid screening to adults aged 40 to 75 years**, recommending assessment of **lifetime ASCVD risk** beginning in childhood.  
3. **Lipid testing** is indicated to **evaluate suspected familial hypercholesterolemia**, to **monitor adherence and effectiveness of lipid‑lowering therapy**, and to **investigate complications such as pancreatitis**.  
4. Routine **fasting lipid panels** are **unnecessary for screening** unless **hypertriglyceridemia** or **known coronary artery disease (CAD)** is present.  
5. The principal role of **low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measurement** is to identify individuals **without established ASCVD** who would benefit from interventions and to assess **response to therapy**.  
6. **Secondary causes of elevated LDL cholesterol** include **hypothyroidism**, **poorly controlled diabetes mellitus**, **nephrotic syndrome**, and medications such as **glucocorticoids**, **diuretics**, and **amiodarone**.  
7. In adults with **LDL cholesterol >250 mg/dL (6.48 mmol/L)** or **>190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) plus a first‑degree relative with similar hypercholesterolemia or premature CAD**, **genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia** may be considered.  
8. **Triglyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.65 mmol/L)** can precipitate **acute pancreatitis** and should prompt evaluation for **familial hypertriglyceridemia**.  
9. Pharmacologic therapy to **raise high‑density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol** is **not recommended**, despite the inverse association between HDL cholesterol and ASCVD risk.  
10. **Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] cholesterol ≥50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L)** is associated with **increased cardiovascular risk**, but **no randomized evidence** shows that lowering Lp(a) reduces cardiovascular events.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. PREVENT was developed to improve equity by omitting race from risk estimation.  
2. Early screening facilitates lifestyle counseling and identification of genetic dyslipidemias in youth.  
3. Severe hypertriglyceridemia can cause pancreatitis, and lipid testing guides both diagnosis and treatment monitoring.  
4. Non‑fasting samples are adequate for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol measurement in most adults.  
5. Fixed‑dose statin therapy targets relative risk reduction rather than LDL goal attainment in primary prevention.  
6. Medications raise LDL through varied mechanisms, including decreased hepatic LDL receptor expression.  
7. Genetic confirmation supports cascade screening of relatives and may alter treatment intensity.  
8. Chylomicronemia often accompanies triglyceride levels in this range and contributes to pancreatitis risk.  
9. HDL‑raising agents such as niacin and fibrates have not demonstrated outcome benefit in randomized trials.  
10. Lp(a) acts as a risk enhancer in current ASCVD prevention guidelines, guiding more aggressive risk‑reduction strategies.
