### 🫀 Dyslipidemia: Statin Therapy in Adults ≥75 Years  

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. Managing dyslipidemia for the **primary prevention** of **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** in adults **aged 75 years and older** requires an **individualized approach**.  
2. When statin therapy is selected for patients ≥75 years, a **moderate‑intensity statin** is recommended, and the **expected benefit is less robust** than in younger high‑risk groups.  
3. After a statin is started in an older adult, the **appropriateness of continued therapy** should be **reassessed frequently**.  
4. It is **reasonable to forgo initiating or to discontinue statin therapy** in patients with **functional decline, multiple comorbid conditions, frailty, or reduced life expectancy**.  
5. **High‑intensity statin therapy** is **rarely indicated** in patients **older than 75 years** outside the **acute phase of acute coronary syndrome**.  
6. **Older adults** are **more likely** to experience **statin‑associated muscle pain or weakness** and to have **drug interactions** with statins.  
7. A **coronary artery calcium (CAC) score** can help stratify risk in patients at **borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk** when deciding on statin therapy.  
8. In **select patients** with **persistently elevated triglyceride levels despite statin therapy**, particularly those with **established cardiovascular disease**, adding **icosapent ethyl** may lower cardiovascular event risk.  

#### 💬 Extra  
1. *(Refers to Statement 4)* Indicators of **frailty**, such as **weakness, unintentional weight loss, and impaired balance**, guide decisions to withdraw preventive medications like statins in older adults.  
2. *(Refers to Statement 6)* Discontinuing unnecessary drugs can **reduce pill burden** and **decrease adverse‑effect risk** in frail patients who take multiple medications.

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. Adults **older than 75 years** without known ASCVD and an **LDL cholesterol level of 70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (1.81–4.90 mmol/L)** may discuss the **potential benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention**.  
2. When statin therapy is chosen in this group, a **moderate‑intensity statin** is recommended, and the **benefit is less robust** than in higher‑risk populations.  
3. If the decision to start a statin is uncertain, measuring the **CAC score** is useful because **statin therapy can be avoided if the CAC score is 0**.  
4. It is **reasonable to forgo initiating or to discontinue statin therapy** in the presence of **functional decline, multiple comorbid conditions, frailty, or reduced life expectancy**.  
5. For **secondary prevention** in patients **older than 75 years**, continuing a **moderate‑intensity statin** is **beneficial and preferred** over high‑intensity therapy in those already tolerating statins.  
6. **Initiating statin therapy** is **not recommended** in adults receiving **dialysis for end‑stage kidney disease**, though **continuing an existing statin** may be reasonable.  
7. Counseling women about statins should account for **premature menopause** and **pregnancy‑associated disorders** (hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), which increase ASCVD risk.  
8. **Statins are contraindicated during pregnancy**; women of child‑bearing age should use **reliable contraception** while on a statin and **stop therapy 1–2 months before attempting pregnancy**.  
9. Patients with **HIV infection** have **increased coronary artery disease risk**; in such patients with low‑to‑moderate ASCVD risk, **moderate‑intensity pitavastatin** reduced cardiovascular events by **35 % over 5 years** compared with placebo.  
10. Patients with **rheumatoid arthritis** and other chronic inflammatory conditions have **increased cardiovascular risk**, but there are **no unique criteria** for initiating lipid‑lowering therapy in these populations.
