### 🫠 Cardiology: Patent Foramen Ovale Closure in Embolic Stroke

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Patent foramen ovale (PFO)** closure is recommended for patients **younger than 60 years** with a **cryptogenic embolic stroke** and **high-risk PFO features**.
2. **Catheter-based PFO closure** is a preferred treatment option in appropriate younger patients, following a **discussion of benefits and risks**, including **periprocedural complications** and **non-procedural atrial fibrillation**.
3. For patients who do **not undergo PFO closure**, **antiplatelet** or **anticoagulation therapy** is a reasonable alternative.
4. There are **no data supporting the combination** of **antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy** (e.g., **aspirin plus warfarin**) in PFO-associated stroke.
5. **Right heart catheterization** is not helpful in evaluating a **patent foramen ovale** unless **pulmonary arterial hypertension** or **atrial septal defect (ASD)** is suspected.
6. **Repeat transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** with bubble study is not necessary if a **large PFO with shunting** has already been demonstrated.
7. **Data are lacking** regarding the benefit of PFO closure in patients **older than 60 years**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This recommendation applies to patients with embolic stroke and **no alternate stroke mechanism**, such as large-artery atherosclerosis or atrial fibrillation.
2. PFO closure decreases recurrent stroke risk but may increase atrial fibrillation incidence.
3. In patients declining closure or over age 60, therapy selection is individualized.
4. Dual therapy increases bleeding risk without clear benefit in this context.
5. Right heart catheterization may be useful in **ASD-related evaluations**, not for isolated PFO with good functional status.
6. A **prior TEE with shunt confirmation** suffices; repeated imaging adds no value.
7. Clinical trials for PFO closure have primarily enrolled **younger adult populations**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **foramen ovale** is a fetal circulatory passage in the **interatrial septum**, which normally closes within the **first weeks of life**, but remains patent in **25% to 30%** of adults.
2. A **patent foramen ovale (PFO)** is typically found incidentally during **echocardiography** or **stroke evaluation**.
3. **Right-to-left shunting** across a PFO can be demonstrated by **color Doppler** or **agitated saline bubble study**, often with a **Valsalva maneuver**.
4. **PFO closure** is recommended in patients younger than 60 years with **high-risk PFO features** and **embolism of undetermined source**, after shared decision-making.
5. **High-risk features** include a **right-to-left shunt**, **atrial septal aneurysm**, and **absence of other embolic sources**.
6. **Antiplatelet therapy** is recommended for patients with PFO and embolic stroke who do not undergo closure.
7. There are **insufficient data** to support PFO closure for the treatment of **migraine**.
8. **No follow-up or treatment** is needed in **asymptomatic patients** with incidentally detected PFO.
9. **Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome** is a rare indication for PFO closure and is characterized by **upright hypoxemia and dyspnea** due to **right-to-left shunt**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The persistence of a PFO is considered a normal variant but may be clinically significant in select contexts.
3. Saline contrast studies are sensitive for detecting **functional shunting** across the atrial septum.
4. Guideline-directed closure is limited to stroke prevention and not other speculative benefits.
5. These features elevate the risk of **paradoxical embolism**.
7. Migraine treatment with PFO closure has not demonstrated consistent benefit in clinical trials.
9. Evaluation by a cardiologist is necessary when cyanosis is present with a known PFO.
