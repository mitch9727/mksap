### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Pulmonary Valve Stenosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pulmonary valve stenosis** causes obstruction of the **right ventricular (RV) outflow tract** and is usually an **isolated valve lesion**.
2. **Mild pulmonary valve stenosis** is typically **asymptomatic**, well tolerated, and rarely progresses to severe stenosis.
3. **Moderate to severe pulmonary valve stenosis** can cause **dyspnea** and **exercise intolerance**.
4. A **systolic ejection click** that **decreases during inspiration** is characteristic of **pulmonary valve stenosis**.
5. A **crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur** at the **upper left sternal border** is characteristic of **pulmonary valve stenosis**.
6. The **systolic ejection click** results from **restricted opening** of **tethered pulmonary valve leaflets**.
7. During **inspiration**, increased venous return reduces leaflet excursion, softening the **systolic ejection click**.
8. The **intensity of the murmur** generally correlates with the **severity of pulmonary valve stenosis**.
9. As severity increases, the **pulmonary component of S2** is **delayed** and may **eventually disappear**.
10. A **parasternal lift** suggestive of **RV hypertrophy** may be present in significant **pulmonary valve stenosis**.
11. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** findings in **pulmonary valve stenosis** may reflect **RV hypertrophy** in the presence of significant obstruction.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Patients with mild **exercise intolerance** due to pulmonary valve stenosis may be misdiagnosed with **reactive airways disease** such as **exercise-induced asthma**.
10. The **parasternal lift** on examination reflects **right ventricular hypertrophy** due to pressure overload.
11. The presence of **ECG changes** supports a more severe lesion requiring closer evaluation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Mild and moderate pulmonary stenosis** are generally **asymptomatic**, while **severe pulmonary stenosis** may cause **exertional dyspnea**.
2. **Mild pulmonary stenosis** is associated with a **normal jugular venous waveform** and **precordial impulse**.
3. **Significant pulmonary stenosis** can cause **right ventricular hypertrophy**, leading to a **prominent a wave** on the jugular venous waveform and a **palpable right ventricular lift**.
4. Auscultation in **pulmonary stenosis** reveals an **early systolic ejection click** followed by a **crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur**.
5. In **severe pulmonary stenosis**, the **systolic ejection murmur** increases in **intensity and duration**, and the **pulmonary component of S2** is **delayed** or **absent**.
6. A **right ventricular S4** is often heard in **severe pulmonary stenosis**.
7. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the **imaging modality of choice** for identifying pulmonary stenosis.
8. Pulmonary stenosis causes **right ventricular hypertrophy**, not **right ventricular enlargement**.
9. The presence of **right ventricular dilatation** should prompt evaluation for associated lesions such as **pulmonary regurgitation** or **atrial septal defect (ASD)**.
10. **Cardiac catheterization** is performed when **percutaneous intervention** for pulmonary stenosis is considered.
11. In **pulmonary valve stenosis**, ECG may show **right atrial enlargement**, **right axis deviation**, and **right ventricular hypertrophy** if RV systolic pressure exceeds 60 mm Hg.
12. Chest radiography findings in **pulmonary valve stenosis** may include **pulmonary artery dilatation** and **calcification of the pulmonary valve**; **right atrial enlargement** may be seen rarely.
13. Late complications after repair of **pulmonary valve stenosis** include **severe pulmonary valve regurgitation**, particularly after **valvotomy** or **valvuloplasty**.
14. In **aortic coarctation**, chest radiograph may show a **“figure 3 sign”** and **rib notching** due to collateral flow.
15. **Repaired tetralogy of Fallot** is associated with **right bundle branch block (RBBB)** and increased **QRS duration** on ECG.
16. **Eisenmenger syndrome** may show **right ventricular hypertrophy**, **prominent pulmonary artery**, and **reduced pulmonary vascularity** on chest radiograph.
17. In **ostium secundum atrial septal defect**, ECG may show **incomplete right bundle branch block**, **right atrial enlargement**, and **right axis deviation**.
18. **Patent foramen ovale** typically has **normal ECG and chest radiograph findings**.
19. Late complications of **large ventricular septal defects** include **pulmonary arterial hypertension**, **Eisenmenger syndrome**, and **right-sided heart failure**.
20. **Small ventricular septal defects** and **small patent ductus arteriosus** lesions are associated with a risk of **endocarditis** despite normal imaging.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Severe pulmonary stenosis** reduces cardiac output during exertion, resulting in **dyspnea**.
3. The **giant a wave** results from **impaired right atrial emptying** due to RV pressure overload.
4. The **early systolic ejection click** is the **only right-sided heart sound** that **decreases with inspiration**.
7. **TTE** provides structural and Doppler assessment of RV pressure gradients.
9. **Right ventricular dilatation** is uncommon in isolated PS and often indicates **additional congenital lesions**.
11. These ECG changes reflect pressure overload on the right heart from outflow obstruction.
12. Valve calcification and right atrial enlargement indicate chronic PS progression.
13. Regurgitation results from disruption of valve integrity during repair.
14. Rib notching is due to enlarged intercostal arteries collateralizing around the narrowed segment.
15. A prolonged QRS >180 ms increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.
16. These findings represent chronic hypoxia and shunting physiology.
17. These ECG features are classic for volume overload of the right heart due to left-to-right shunt.
18. PFO is often a silent lesion, only diagnosed by contrast imaging or bubble study.
19. Chronic left-to-right shunting causes elevated pulmonary pressures and eventual reversal.
20. Even small defects can allow bacterial seeding, particularly in high-flow turbulent lesions.
