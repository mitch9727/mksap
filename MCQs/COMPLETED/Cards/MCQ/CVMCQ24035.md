### 🫠 Cardiology: Endocarditis in Congenital Heart Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **congenital heart disease** are at increased risk for **infective endocarditis**, especially those with **unrepaired defects**, **repaired disease with residual defects**, or **prosthetic material** such as a **patch** or **valve**.
2. **Infective endocarditis** may present with **nonspecific symptoms**, including **fever**, **fatigue**, and **malaise**, particularly in patients with underlying **congenital heart disease**.
3. **Right-sided infective endocarditis** may follow an **indolent course** and may lack typical systemic findings such as high fever or leukocytosis.
4. A **high index of suspicion** for **infective endocarditis** is warranted in any patient with a history of **congenital heart disease** who presents with symptoms potentially attributable to endocarditis.
5. At least **two sets of blood cultures** should be obtained when even a modest probability of **infective endocarditis** exists.
6. **Echocardiography** should be performed when **infective endocarditis** is suspected in patients with **congenital heart disease**.
7. In patients with **prosthetic valve endocarditis**, **vancomycin and cefepime** are an appropriate empiric antibiotic regimen.
8. **Antibiotic therapy** should be initiated as soon as possible in **infective endocarditis**, but only **after blood cultures are obtained**, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or in septic shock.
9. **C-reactive protein** and **procalcitonin** may be elevated in **infective endocarditis**, but they are **not reliable** for assessing the likelihood of disease.
10. **Clinical observation alone** is not appropriate for patients at high risk for **infective endocarditis**, even in the absence of fever or leukocytosis.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The presence of a **bioprosthetic valve** and **poor dentition** further increases endocarditis risk.
2. Symptoms such as **low-grade temperature elevations**, **fatigue**, and **malaise** in high-risk individuals warrant urgent evaluation.
3. Fever and leukocytosis may be absent in **right-sided endocarditis** or infections with **less virulent organisms**.
5. Drawing blood cultures before antibiotics helps ensure accurate microbiologic diagnosis.
7. These agents provide broad-spectrum coverage, including **staphylococci**, **streptococci**, and **Gram-negative organisms**.
8. In unstable patients, **empiric antibiotic therapy** should not be delayed for culture results.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Late complications of **repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)** include **right heart failure** due to **pulmonary valve regurgitation**, and less commonly, **pulmonary stenosis** and **left heart failure**.
2. **Indications for pulmonary valve replacement** in patients with **severe pulmonary regurgitation** include **symptoms**, **decreased exercise tolerance**, **moderate or greater right heart enlargement**, **right or left ventricular dysfunction**, and **arrhythmias**.
3. **Pulmonary valve replacement** is reasonable in **asymptomatic patients** with **ventricular enlargement or dysfunction** and **moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation**.
4. Patients with **repaired TOF** may develop **atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias**, which should prompt evaluation of **valve and ventricular function**.
5. Patients with **pulmonary valve replacements** are at risk for **infective endocarditis** and require **endocarditis prophylaxis** and evaluation for **unexplained fever**.
6. **Physical activity restriction** is recommended in patients with **residual sequelae of repaired TOF**, including avoidance of **contact sports** and **heavy isometric exercise**.
7. Patients with **repaired TOF** and **no residual lesions after pulmonary valve replacement** may not require physical activity restrictions.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Volume overload from pulmonary regurgitation leads to **progressive right ventricular dilation** and dysfunction.
2. Symptom onset or imaging findings help guide timing of **valve replacement**.
4. Arrhythmias may indicate structural deterioration and necessitate prompt reassessment.
5. **Fever** in such patients should not be dismissed due to the risk of **prosthetic valve infection**.
