### 🫠 Cardiology: Adult Congenital Heart Disease—Severe Pulmonary Stenosis Follow‑up

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Adults with **congenital heart defects**—even after childhood surgical repair—require **lifelong follow‑up by an adult congenital cardiology specialist** to monitor for late complications.
2. Development of **late complications in adult congenital heart disease**, such as **severe pulmonary stenosis (PS)** with **right ventricular (RV) decompensation**, should be **managed in conjunction with a congenital cardiologist**, who can obtain advanced imaging and offer surgical or transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement when indicated.
3. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is useful for assessing myocardial, pericardial, and selected valvular disorders in congenital heart disease, but **should be ordered in consultation with an adult congenital heart disease expert** rather than as first‑line management.
4. In **severe pulmonary stenosis**, an elevated **RV systolic pressure** usually reflects the **trans‑pulmonary valve gradient** and not true **pulmonary hypertension**; empiric use of **pulmonary vasodilators** in this context may be harmful.
5. Symptomatic patients with suspected **severe pulmonary stenosis** and evidence of RV dysfunction require **prompt referral for evaluation and possible intervention**; waiting **6 months** for repeat echocardiography would inappropriately delay treatment.
6. **Gaps in specialized congenital heart disease care**, such as being **lost to follow‑up for more than a decade**, increase the risk of preventable adverse outcomes.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Childhood surgery often alleviates—but does not “cure”—congenital heart disease; residual lesions and sequelae can emerge decades later.
2. Imaging choices typically include **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** to quantify PS severity, with **CMR** or **cardiac computed tomography** reserved for complex anatomy or surgical planning.
3. CMR offers detailed assessment of ventricular size, function, flow, and scar burden, making it valuable once the need for advanced imaging is established.
4. The **pulmonary artery systolic pressure** is calculated by subtracting the Doppler‑derived **PS gradient** from the **RV systolic pressure**; failure to do so overestimates pulmonary pressures.
5. Delays allow progression to RV failure and worsen surgical or transcatheter outcomes.
6. Longitudinal registries show that routine follow‑up in specialized congenital heart centers reduces unanticipated hospitalizations and mortality.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Mild and moderate pulmonary stenosis (PS)** are typically **asymptomatic**, whereas **severe PS** often presents with **exertional dyspnea**.
2. Progressive **right ventricular hypertrophy** in pulmonary stenosis produces a **prominent a wave** on the jugular venous waveform and a palpable **right ventricular lift** on precordial examination.
3. **Auscultation in pulmonary stenosis** reveals an **early systolic ejection click** that **diminishes with inspiration**, followed by a **crescendo‑decrescendo systolic murmur** whose intensity and duration increase with severity; in **severe PS**, the pulmonary component of **S2** becomes delayed or absent.
4. A **right ventricular S4** is frequently audible in **severe pulmonary stenosis**.
5. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the **imaging modality of choice** for identifying and grading pulmonary stenosis.
6. **Pulmonary stenosis** causes **right ventricular hypertrophy** without chamber enlargement; detection of **right ventricular dilatation** should prompt evaluation for associated lesions such as **pulmonary regurgitation** or an **atrial septal defect (ASD)**.
7. **Cardiac catheterization** is performed when **percutaneous intervention** for pulmonary stenosis is being considered.
11. In **pulmonary valve stenosis**, ECG may show **right atrial enlargement**, **right axis deviation**, and **right ventricular hypertrophy** if RV systolic pressure exceeds 60 mm Hg.
12. Chest radiography findings in **pulmonary valve stenosis** may include **pulmonary artery dilatation** and **calcification of the pulmonary valve**; **right atrial enlargement** may be seen rarely.
13. Late complications after repair of **pulmonary valve stenosis** include **severe pulmonary valve regurgitation**, particularly after **valvotomy** or **valvuloplasty**.
14. In **aortic coarctation**, chest radiograph may show a **“figure 3 sign”** and **rib notching** due to collateral flow.
15. **Repaired tetralogy of Fallot** is associated with **right bundle branch block (RBBB)** and increased **QRS duration** on ECG.
16. **Eisenmenger syndrome** may show **right ventricular hypertrophy**, **prominent pulmonary artery**, and **reduced pulmonary vascularity** on chest radiograph.
17. In **ostium secundum atrial septal defect**, ECG may show **incomplete right bundle branch block**, **right atrial enlargement**, and **right axis deviation**.
18. **Patent foramen ovale** typically has **normal ECG and chest radiograph findings**.
19. Late complications of **large ventricular septal defects** include **pulmonary arterial hypertension**, **Eisenmenger syndrome**, and **right-sided heart failure**.
20. **Small ventricular septal defects** and **small patent ductus arteriosus** lesions are associated with a risk of **endocarditis** despite normal imaging.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Asymptomatic status correlates with Doppler‑derived gradients <36 mm Hg, while symptoms correlate with higher gradients and worsening RV compliance.
2. The supplemental video “Giant a Wave” demonstrates the large jugular **a wave** created by impaired right‑atrial emptying when the RV is hypertrophied or non‑compliant.
3. The systolic ejection click of PS uniquely **softens during inspiration** because the pulmonary valve opens earlier as RV preload rises.
4. The presence of an **S4** reflects a stiff RV that requires atrial contraction for late diastolic filling.
5. TTE provides direct measurement of the **peak instantaneous** and **mean trans‑pulmonary gradients** that define PS severity.
6. RV dilatation in the setting of fixed PS suggests volume overload from regurgitation or shunting rather than pressure overload alone.
7. Catheterization allows simultaneous pressure measurement and balloon valvotomy or valve implantation when indicated.
11. These ECG changes reflect pressure overload on the right heart from outflow obstruction.
12. Valve calcification and right atrial enlargement indicate chronic PS progression.
13. Regurgitation results from disruption of valve integrity during repair.
14. Rib notching is due to enlarged intercostal arteries collateralizing around the narrowed segment.
15. A prolonged QRS >180 ms increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.
16. These findings represent chronic hypoxia and shunting physiology.
17. These ECG features are classic for volume overload of the right heart due to left-to-right shunt.
18. PFO is often a silent lesion, only diagnosed by contrast imaging or bubble study.
19. Chronic left-to-right shunting causes elevated pulmonary pressures and eventual reversal.
20. Even small defects can allow bacterial seeding, particularly in high-flow turbulent lesions.
