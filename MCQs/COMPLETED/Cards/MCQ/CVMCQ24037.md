### 🫠 Aortic Disease: Turner Syndrome and Aortic Aneurysm Screening

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Turner syndrome** is associated with an increased risk of **bicuspid aortic valve**, **aortic coarctation**, and **thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)**.
2. **Echocardiography** and **cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** should be completed at the time of diagnosis of **Turner syndrome** to screen for congenital heart defects and TAA.
3. **Echocardiography** is the initial imaging modality used to detect **aortic coarctation**, **congenital heart defects**, and **thoracic aortic aneurysm**.
4. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the **thoracic aorta** than echocardiography.
5. **Computed tomography (CT) angiography** is not recommended as the initial screening modality for aortic disease in Turner syndrome due to **radiation and contrast exposure**.
6. **Exercise stress testing** is not indicated for cardiovascular screening in Turner syndrome.
7. Performing **no further evaluation** in patients with newly diagnosed Turner syndrome is inappropriate due to their elevated risk of aortic disease.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Thoracic aortic aneurysms in Turner syndrome are usually due to cystic medial degeneration, leading to weakening of the aortic wall.
2. These tests help identify congenital heart abnormalities as well as aneurysmal changes in the aorta.
5. CT angiography may be useful if further evaluation is required after initial echocardiographic screening.
6. The major cardiovascular risks in Turner syndrome involve the aorta, not exercise-induced ischemia.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)** is defined as an increase in thoracic aortic diameter of more than **50%** above the expected value for age, sex, and body size.
2. TAAs most commonly involve the **aortic root** and **ascending aorta**.
3. The most frequent pathologic mechanism of TAA is **cystic medial degeneration**.
4. **Connective tissue disorders**, such as **Marfan syndrome**, **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**, and **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**, are major causes of TAA in patients younger than 50 years.
5. Approximately **20%** of thoracic aortic aneurysms are **genetic or heritable**.
6. **Bicuspid aortic valve** is a significant risk factor for TAA, which occurs in ~50% of affected individuals.
7. Risk factors for TAA include **hypertension**, **smoking**, and **advanced age**.
8. TAAs are often **asymptomatic** and may be detected incidentally on imaging.
9. **Aortic regurgitation** may occur with TAA and present with **diastolic murmur**, **wide pulse pressure**, or **heart failure symptoms**.
10. Patients with a **family history of TAA/dissection** or who are **younger than 60 years** at presentation should undergo **genetic testing**.
11. If a **pathogenic variant** is identified, **first-degree relatives** should undergo **genetic screening** and **aortic imaging**.
12. In the absence of a pathologic genetic variant, first-degree relatives of affected individuals should still undergo **aortic imaging**.
13. Aortic imaging is indicated in all **asymptomatic patients** with a **bicuspid aortic valve** or a **genetic syndrome** predisposing to aortic disease.
14. Surveillance for TAA depends on **aneurysm size**, **location**, and **expansion rate**, with an average expansion of **0.1 cm/year**.
15. Expansion is faster during **pregnancy**, in **ascending aorta**, or with **Marfan syndrome** or **bicuspid aortic valve**.
16. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is preferred for imaging aneurysms <5.0 cm if good image quality is achievable.
17. Other imaging options include **CT angiography** and **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**.
18. **Medical therapy** for TAA includes **blood pressure control (<130/80 mm Hg)**, preferably with **β-blockers**, and **statin therapy**.
19. In **Marfan syndrome**, **β-blockers** and **losartan** may slow aneurysm growth.
20. **Elective aortic repair** is indicated for ascending aneurysms >5.5 cm or growing ≥0.5 cm/year.
21. **Surgery** may be considered for nonsyndromic aneurysms at ≥5.0 cm or ≥4.5 cm if family history is high risk.
22. In **bicuspid aortic valve**, repair is recommended at >5.5 cm or at 5.0 cm if additional risk factors are present.
23. **Descending aortic aneurysms** >5.5 cm warrant **thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)**.
24. TEVAR is preferred in patients at **high surgical risk** and offers benefit over open repair.
25. TEVAR complications include **stroke**, **spinal ischemia**, and **aortic graft endoleaks**.
26. **Smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome** and **ankylosing spondylitis** are connective tissue disorders associated with **thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)**.
27. **Relapsing polychondritis** and **IgG4-related disease** are autoimmune conditions that may cause **vasculitis-associated thoracic aortic aneurysm**.
28. **Direct bacterial inoculation**, **septic embolism**, **bacteremia**, and **syphilis** are infectious causes of **thoracic aortic aneurysm**.
29. **Aortography** provides **exact information** on **aortic size, shape, and anomalies**, but has **poor ability to diagnose intramural hematoma** due to lack of luminal disruption.
30. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** has a **sensitivity of 77%-80%** and **specificity of 93%-96%** for proximal aortic dissection.
31. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** has a **sensitivity of 88%-98%** and **specificity of 90%-95%** for proximal aortic dissection.
32. **CT angiography (CTA)** achieves **100% sensitivity** and **98%-99% specificity** for detecting thoracic aortic abnormalities.
33. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** achieves **>98% sensitivity and specificity** for detecting thoracic aortic abnormalities.
34. **Aortography** requires **power injection of contrast**, may be **nephrotoxic**, and carries a risk of **catheter-induced aortic dissection**.
35. **Surveillance frequency** for thoracic aortic aneurysm in **degenerative conditions including bicuspid aortic valve** is:
    - Every 12 months for 3.5–4.4 cm
    - Every 6 months for 4.5–5.4 cm
36. In **Marfan syndrome**, aneurysms ≥5.0 cm usually prompt **surgical repair** rather than surveillance.
37. In **newly diagnosed Marfan syndrome**, follow-up imaging should be performed **6 months after diagnosis** to assess the **rate of aortic enlargement**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This diagnostic threshold accounts for normal aortic size variation.
3. Cystic medial degeneration involves loss of smooth muscle and elastic fibers.
10. Genetic testing should be done even if no clinical signs of a syndrome are apparent.
14. Faster growth is an independent predictor of rupture risk.
18. These therapies reduce aneurysm expansion and complications.
22. Additional risk factors include family history, rapid growth, coarctation, or root dilation.
26. These disorders are less commonly discussed but contribute to aortopathy via connective tissue abnormalities.
29. This is why aortography is often reserved for interventional planning rather than first-line diagnosis.
35. These intervals guide echocardiographic or cross-sectional imaging schedules to assess aneurysm stability or progression.
36. Surgical thresholds are lower in genetically mediated aortopathies due to higher rupture risk.
