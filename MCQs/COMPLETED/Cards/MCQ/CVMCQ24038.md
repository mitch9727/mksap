### 🫠 Aortic Disease: Marfan Syndrome and Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Surveillance

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Marfan syndrome** is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** pattern and involves **multisystem abnormalities**, including **aortic disease**, **mitral valve prolapse**, **musculoskeletal abnormalities**, and **ectopia lentis**.
2. Patients with **Marfan syndrome** should undergo **aortic imaging** at diagnosis and have the study **repeated 6 months later** to determine the **rate of aortic enlargement**.
3. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is preferred for **surveillance** of **thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)** in Marfan syndrome to **avoid radiation** and provide **detailed aortic assessment**.
4. For **aneurysms measuring 3.5 to 4.4 cm**, follow-up imaging should occur **annually**.
5. For **aneurysms measuring 4.5 to 5.0 cm**, follow-up imaging should occur **every 6 months**.
6. **More frequent imaging** is recommended if **aortic diameter increases by more than 0.5 cm per year** or if the aneurysm is **approaching the threshold for repair**.
7. **Elective aortic repair** in patients with Marfan syndrome is generally indicated when the aneurysm reaches **5.0 cm in diameter**.
8. Patients with **Marfan syndrome and thoracic aortic aneurysm** should be counseled to avoid **isometric exercise with straining**, **competitive contact sports**, **scuba diving**, and **exercising to exhaustion**.
9. **Transthoracic echocardiography**, **CT**, and **CMR** are all acceptable imaging modalities for **aortic surveillance**, though CMR is often preferred for serial imaging.
10. **A family history of aortic dissection** in a **first-degree relative** increases the importance of **close monitoring** in patients with Marfan syndrome.

#### 💬 Extra
2. A 6-month follow-up allows assessment of the expansion rate and helps stratify future imaging intervals.
3. CMR does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation and allows three-dimensional visualization of the aorta.
4–5. Imaging intervals are guided by the diameter of the aneurysm, per 2022 ACC/AHA guidelines.
8. These activities are discouraged due to their association with increased aortic wall stress and dissection risk.
10. The patient in this case had a dilated aorta and family history of dissection, further supporting the need for early follow-up.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Screening for **thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)** is indicated in asymptomatic patients with **bicuspid aortic valve** and **genetic syndromes** such as **Marfan syndrome**, **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**, and **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**.
2. **First-degree relatives** of patients with aortic disease should undergo **genetic testing or aortic imaging**, depending on the features of the index case.
3. **Genetic testing** should be offered in patients with TAA or dissection who have **clinical features of a syndromic condition**, **a family history**, or **onset before age 60**.
4. If a **pathogenic genetic variant** is found, **first-degree relatives** should undergo **variant testing**, and if positive, receive **aortic imaging**.
5. If no genetic variant is identified, **first-degree relatives** should still receive **aortic imaging screening**.
6. If the index case has a **sporadic aneurysm at age ≥60 years**, **aortic imaging** alone is recommended for first-degree relatives.
7. Accurate measurement of the **aortic cross-sectional diameter** must be performed **perpendicular to the aorta's long axis**, and modality differences may affect the result.
8. **TAA rupture** is the **leading cause of death**, and risk of rupture increases with **aneurysm size**, **faster expansion**, and presence of **connective tissue disorders**.
9. The **average TAA expansion rate** is **0.1 cm/year**, but expansion is more rapid in patients with **Marfan syndrome**, **bicuspid aortic valve**, **pregnancy**, or **ascending aortic involvement**.
10. **Transthoracic echocardiography**, **CT angiography**, and **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** are all used for surveillance of TAA, with **TTE preferred** for aneurysms <5.0 cm if visualization is adequate.
11. **CT angiography (CTA)** provides **100% sensitivity** and **98%–99% specificity** for diagnosing thoracic aortic aneurysms.
12. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** is contraindicated in some patients with **implanted pacemakers or defibrillators**.
13. **Some gadolinium contrast agents used in MRA** are contraindicated in patients with **advanced kidney disease** (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m²).
14. **Aortography** requires **power injection within the aorta** and is considered an **invasive procedure**.
15. **Catheter manipulation during aortography** may **worsen aortic dissection**.
16. Patients with **thoracic aortic aneurysm 5.0–5.4 cm** from **degenerative conditions** (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve) should undergo **imaging every 6 months**.
17. **Patients with Marfan syndrome and aneurysms ≥5.0 cm** are typically referred for **surgical repair**, and surveillance is not typically continued beyond this threshold.

#### 💬 Extra
2–6. The decision to pursue genetic testing vs. imaging is based on clinical features, age, and familial history of aneurysmal disease.
2. Genes associated with TAA syndromes include **FBN1**, **TGFBR1**, **TGFBR2**, **COL3A1**, and **MYH11**.
3. Different imaging techniques may yield variable diameters; consistency in modality is important for serial comparisons.
4. Surveillance intervals should be individualized when higher-risk features are present (e.g., pregnancy or syndromic diagnoses).
11. These performance metrics are superior to echocardiographic modalities for detecting dissection.
12. This limitation makes MRA unsuitable in some patients needing long-term device therapy.
13. Group I gadolinium agents are unsafe in severe kidney disease; Group II is safer, and Group III is uncertain.
14. The invasiveness and need for contrast limit its role in routine surveillance.
15. Iatrogenic worsening of dissection is a known procedural risk.
16. This frequency aligns with progression risk and potential surgical planning.
17. ACC/AHA guidelines suggest elective repair once the 5.0 cm threshold is reached in Marfan syndrome.
