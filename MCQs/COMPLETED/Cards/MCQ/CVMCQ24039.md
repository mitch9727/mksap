### 🫠 Cardiology: Genetic Risk of Aortic Dissection

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree relatives** of patients with **thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or dissection** should undergo **noninvasive aortic imaging** to identify asymptomatic disease.
2. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the most appropriate initial screening test for asymptomatic aortic disease in **first-degree relatives**, as it is noninvasive, widely available, and does not require contrast.
3. **Screening echocardiography** may also be considered in **first-degree relatives** of patients with **bicuspid aortic valve**.
4. If **TTE is not available** or the imaging is **inadequate**, **computed tomography angiography (CTA)** or **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** is a reasonable alternative.
5. **Genetic counseling and testing** are indicated for **first-degree relatives** of patients with known pathogenic variants associated with aortic aneurysm or dissection, such as **FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, COL3A1, and MYH11**.
6. In the **absence of a known familial mutation**, **echocardiography** is the most appropriate next step in screening asymptomatic first-degree relatives.
7. **Reassurance alone** is not appropriate in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of individuals with early-onset aortic dissection, due to the potential for **heritable aortic disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This applies regardless of symptom presence and helps detect silent aortic dilation or structural changes.
2. TTE can also identify coexisting conditions like bicuspid aortic valve, common in hereditary aortopathies.
4. These tests provide better visualization of the thoracic and abdominal aorta when TTE is limited by acoustic windows.
5. Genetic testing should follow identification of a mutation in the proband; it guides targeted family screening.
6. In families without a known pathogenic variant, imaging takes precedence to detect phenotypic disease.
7. Early dissection in a family member suggests a genetic aortopathy, necessitating active screening rather than observation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)** is defined as an increase in thoracic aortic diameter of more than **50%** above the expected value for age, sex, and body size.
2. TAAs most commonly involve the **aortic root** and **ascending aorta**.
3. The most frequent pathologic mechanism of TAA is **cystic medial degeneration**.
4. **Connective tissue disorders**, such as **Marfan syndrome**, **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**, and **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**, are major causes of TAA in patients younger than 50 years.
5. Approximately **20%** of thoracic aortic aneurysms are **genetic or heritable**.
6. **Bicuspid aortic valve** is a significant risk factor for TAA, which occurs in ~50% of affected individuals.
7. Risk factors for TAA include **hypertension**, **smoking**, and **advanced age**.
8. TAAs are often **asymptomatic** and may be detected incidentally on imaging.
9. **Aortic regurgitation** may occur with TAA and present with **diastolic murmur**, **wide pulse pressure**, or **heart failure symptoms**.
10. Patients with a **family history of TAA/dissection** or who are **younger than 60 years** at presentation should undergo **genetic testing**.
11. If a **pathogenic variant** is identified, **first-degree relatives** should undergo **genetic screening** and **aortic imaging**.
12. In the absence of a pathologic genetic variant, first-degree relatives of affected individuals should still undergo **aortic imaging**.
13. Aortic imaging is indicated in all **asymptomatic patients** with a **bicuspid aortic valve** or a **genetic syndrome** predisposing to aortic disease.
14. Surveillance for TAA depends on **aneurysm size**, **location**, and **expansion rate**, with an average expansion of **0.1 cm/year**.
15. Expansion is faster during **pregnancy**, in **ascending aorta**, or with **Marfan syndrome** or **bicuspid aortic valve**.
16. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is preferred for imaging aneurysms <5.0 cm if good image quality is achievable.
17. Other imaging options include **CT angiography** and **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**.
18. **Medical therapy** for TAA includes **blood pressure control (<130/80 mm Hg)**, preferably with **β-blockers**, and **statin therapy**.
19. In **Marfan syndrome**, **β-blockers** and **losartan** may slow aneurysm growth.
20. **Elective aortic repair** is indicated for ascending aneurysms >5.5 cm or growing ≥0.5 cm/year.
21. **Surgery** may be considered for nonsyndromic aneurysms at ≥5.0 cm or ≥4.5 cm if family history is high risk.
22. In **bicuspid aortic valve**, repair is recommended at >5.5 cm or at 5.0 cm if additional risk factors are present.
23. **Descending aortic aneurysms** >5.5 cm warrant **thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)**.
24. TEVAR is preferred in patients at **high surgical risk** and offers benefit over open repair.
25. TEVAR complications include **stroke**, **spinal ischemia**, and **aortic graft endoleaks**.
26. **Smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome** and **ankylosing spondylitis** are connective tissue disorders associated with **thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)**.
27. **Relapsing polychondritis** and **IgG4-related disease** are autoimmune conditions that may cause **vasculitis-associated thoracic aortic aneurysm**.
28. **Direct bacterial inoculation**, **septic embolism**, **bacteremia**, and **syphilis** are infectious causes of **thoracic aortic aneurysm**.
29. **Aortography** provides **exact information** on **aortic size, shape, and anomalies**, but has **poor ability to diagnose intramural hematoma** due to lack of luminal disruption.
30. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** has a **sensitivity of 77%-80%** and **specificity of 93%-96%** for proximal aortic dissection.
31. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** has a **sensitivity of 88%-98%** and **specificity of 90%-95%** for proximal aortic dissection.
32. **CT angiography (CTA)** achieves **100% sensitivity** and **98%-99% specificity** for detecting thoracic aortic abnormalities.
33. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** achieves **>98% sensitivity and specificity** for detecting thoracic aortic abnormalities.
34. **Aortography** requires **power injection of contrast**, may be **nephrotoxic**, and carries a risk of **catheter-induced aortic dissection**.
35. **Surveillance frequency** for thoracic aortic aneurysm in **degenerative conditions including bicuspid aortic valve** is:
    - Every 12 months for 3.5–4.4 cm
    - Every 6 months for 4.5–5.4 cm
36. In **Marfan syndrome**, aneurysms ≥5.0 cm usually prompt **surgical repair** rather than surveillance.
37. In **newly diagnosed Marfan syndrome**, follow-up imaging should be performed **6 months after diagnosis** to assess the **rate of aortic enlargement**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This diagnostic threshold accounts for normal aortic size variation.
3. Cystic medial degeneration involves loss of smooth muscle and elastic fibers.
10. Genetic testing should be done even if no clinical signs of a syndrome are apparent.
14. Faster growth is an independent predictor of rupture risk.
18. These therapies reduce aneurysm expansion and complications.
22. Additional risk factors include family history, rapid growth, coarctation, or root dilation.
26. These disorders are less commonly discussed but contribute to aortopathy via connective tissue abnormalities.
29. This is why aortography is often reserved for interventional planning rather than first-line diagnosis.
35. These intervals guide echocardiographic or cross-sectional imaging schedules to assess aneurysm stability or progression.
36. Surgical thresholds are lower in genetically mediated aortopathies due to higher rupture risk.
