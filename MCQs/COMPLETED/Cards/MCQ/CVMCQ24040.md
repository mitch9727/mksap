### 🫠 Cardiology: Coronary Artery Disease After Chest Irradiation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Thoracic irradiation therapy** in childhood may cause long-term damage to the **pericardium**, **myocardium**, **valves**, **coronary vasculature**, and **conduction system**, typically manifesting clinically two to three decades after treatment.
2. **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** caused by **radiation therapy** often involves **ostial**, **long**, **smooth**, and **concentric lesions** with higher **fibrotic content** than standard atherosclerotic lesions.
3. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as **smoking**, **dyslipidemia**, and **hypertension** increase the incidence of **radiation-induced CAD**, and aggressive management of these risk factors is indicated.
4. Young adults who received **chest irradiation** during childhood and present with **chest pain** should undergo prompt evaluation for **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
5. **Regadenoson myocardial perfusion imaging** is an appropriate diagnostic modality for evaluating **myocardial ischemia** in patients with suspected **radiation-induced CAD**.
6. **Conduction system abnormalities** such as **ECG conduction delays** may be a manifestation of prior **radiation-induced cardiac damage**.
7. In the absence of **pleuritic chest pain**, **friction rub**, or **typical ECG changes**, **acute pericarditis** is less likely despite a history of thoracic irradiation.
8. In younger patients with chest pain and no clear cause, **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** may be considered, but **radiation-induced CAD** must be prioritized in those with a history of thoracic irradiation.
9. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is useful for evaluating **valvular** and **pericardial disease**, but **stress testing** is preferred when **coronary artery disease** is the main concern.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The latency of radiation-induced cardiac complications emphasizes the importance of long-term surveillance in cancer survivors.
2. Radiation-associated CAD differs pathologically from typical atherosclerosis, influencing imaging findings and potentially revascularization strategies.
4. Earlier onset of CAD due to irradiation warrants a higher index of suspicion and lower threshold for cardiac work-up in symptomatic young adults.
5. Regadenoson is a vasodilator stress agent suitable for patients with limited exercise tolerance or conduction abnormalities.
6. The presence of conduction delay in this patient suggests possible early radiation-related conduction disease.
7. NSAIDs like **ibuprofen** are indicated in pericarditis but not in cases lacking typical clinical features.
8. While **pantoprazole** can be empirically used for GERD-related chest pain, in high-risk patients such as those with prior radiation, cardiac causes should be excluded first.
9. Echocardiography remains essential in many post-radiation evaluations but lacks sensitivity for ischemia-related assessments.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Radiation therapy to the thorax** is associated with a wide spectrum of **cardiovascular complications**, including **pericardial disease**, **valvular dysfunction**, **conduction abnormalities**, **myocardial fibrosis**, and **coronary artery disease**.
2. **Constrictive pericarditis** occurs in **10% to 20%** of patients **5 to 10 years** after **chest radiation therapy**, even in those who never had **acute pericarditis**.
3. **Pericardial calcification** is not always visible in cases of **radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis**.
4. **Radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis** can cause **diastolic dysfunction** and **restrictive cardiomyopathy** physiology.
5. Differentiating **restrictive cardiomyopathy** from **constrictive pericarditis** is critical, as treatment and prognosis differ.
6. Radiation-related **valvular disease** most often affects **left-sided valves** and progresses from **regurgitation** to **mixed regurgitation and stenosis** over time.
7. Radiation therapy may damage the **aorta**, leading to **calcification** that complicates surgical aortic valve replacement.
8. Up to **75%** of long-term survivors of **mediastinal radiation** show **conduction abnormalities** on **ECG**, including **sinus node dysfunction** and **heart block**.
9. **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** after radiation is more likely to involve **ostial**, **long**, **smooth**, and **concentric lesions** with a **high fibrotic content**.
10. Radiation-associated **aortic stenosis** is linked to **worse surgical outcomes** and **higher cardiovascular mortality** compared to non-radiation patients.
11. In patients with prior radiation, **percutaneous aortic valve replacement** is often preferred over **surgical approaches**.
12. **Stress echocardiography** is recommended **5–10 years** after radiation therapy or by **age 30**, whichever comes first, for surveillance.
13. **Serum biomarkers** are **not recommended** for routine surveillance of radiation-induced cardiac disease.
14. **Routine nuclear imaging** or **coronary computed tomography (CT)** should be avoided in asymptomatic patients post-radiation.
15. **Statins**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**, and **aldosterone antagonists** are not proven to **prevent radiation-induced cardiovascular disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Late-onset constriction may occur even without any prior history of **acute pericarditis**, underscoring the need for long-term follow-up.
4. Radiation-induced fibrosis leads to **restrictive physiology** that can mimic other forms of **cardiomyopathy**.
6. Valvular lesions begin with **retraction-related regurgitation** and later develop **fibrosis and calcification**.
8. These conduction defects may necessitate **permanent pacemaker** implantation, especially after **valve surgery**.
9. Radiation-accelerated atherosclerosis differs **morphologically** from traditional CAD, influencing **revascularization decisions**.
10. Higher mortality is observed both **short-term and long-term** after **valve surgery** in patients with prior radiation exposure.
12. Early detection through **noninvasive imaging** is advised even in **asymptomatic** cancer survivors.
14. These tests have **limited utility** in low-risk, asymptomatic individuals and may result in **false positives**.
15. Current evidence does not support **primary prevention** of radiation-related cardiotoxicity with pharmacologic therapy.
