### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Mitral Stenosis and Pregnancy Risk

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Severe mitral stenosis** is a contraindication to pregnancy because it confers maternal risk for **heart failure**, **arrhythmias**, and **thrombotic events** if not addressed before conception.
2. **Conditions that confer significant cardiovascular risk in pregnancy** should be corrected before conception.
3. Patients with significant **obstructive left-sided valvular disease**, such as **aortic stenosis** and **mitral stenosis**, are at particularly high risk for **maternal mortality and morbidity** or **fetal complications**.
4. **Multidisciplinary evaluation** should be performed in patients with cardiovascular disease anticipating pregnancy to assess risk and develop a pregnancy and delivery management plan.
5. **Cardio-obstetrics teams** are ideally suited to counsel patients on pregnancy risks and management options such as **valve replacement** or **balloon valvuloplasty**.
6. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is used to assess **mitral valve anatomy** suitability for **balloon valvuloplasty** in severe mitral stenosis.
7. **Exercise testing** is not helpful in patients with **symptomatic severe mitral stenosis** when pregnancy risk is already known to be high.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This includes women with **rheumatic mitral stenosis** and significant **exercise intolerance** contemplating pregnancy.
4. Evaluation should include a **cardiologist**, **maternal-fetal medicine specialist**, and **obstetric anesthesiologist**.
5. Management decisions include counseling on **pregnancy avoidance**, **surgical or interventional options**, and **future pregnancy timing**.
6. TEE is typically done once pregnancy is deferred and intervention is being considered.
7. Exercise testing is reserved for those with **uncertain pregnancy risk**, not for clearly high-risk individuals.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All women with **cardiovascular disease** should receive **pregnancy counseling**.
2. Women with significant cardiovascular disease anticipating pregnancy should undergo **multidisciplinary evaluation** involving a **cardiologist**, **maternal-fetal medicine specialist**, and **obstetric anesthesiologist**.
3. **Cardio-obstetrics teams** manage patients from **preconception through the postpartum period**.
4. Risk assessment for pregnancy in cardiovascular disease is best done using the **modified World Health Organization (WHO) pregnancy risk classification**.
5. **Exercise testing** to assess **heart rate response** and **maximal oxygen consumption** may aid in risk stratification for pregnancy in selected cases.
6. Cardiovascular conditions that confer **high maternal and fetal risk** in pregnancy include **pulmonary hypertension**, **severe left ventricular dysfunction**, **severe mitral/aortic stenosis**, **mechanical valves**, **aortopathy**, and others.
7. Structural heart lesions with high risk should be **addressed before pregnancy** if possible.
8. Patients with **Marfan syndrome** and an **aortic diameter ≥4.5 cm** should undergo **aortic repair before pregnancy**.
9. Certain conditions such as **uncomplicated patent ductus arteriosus**, **mild mitral valve prolapse**, and **successfully repaired simple congenital lesions** do not increase maternal risk during pregnancy.

#### 💬 Extra
2. This team approach ensures that pregnancy-related cardiovascular risks are minimized and managed proactively.
4. The modified WHO classification stratifies maternal risk from class I (no detectable increased risk) to class IV (pregnancy contraindicated).
6. Additional high-risk conditions include **coarctation with residual gradient** and **marked ascending aortic dilatation**.
9. These low-risk patients may not require care at an expert cardio-obstetrics center.
