### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: Mitral Valve Prolapse and Pregnancy Risk

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **asymptomatic mild mitral valve prolapse (MVP)** with **mild mitral regurgitation** are at **low risk** for complications during pregnancy.
2. No further cardiac evaluation is indicated in patients with **mild MVP and mild mitral regurgitation** who are asymptomatic.
3. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are common in young individuals with **mitral valve prolapse** and do not necessarily indicate more significant cardiac disease.
4. During pregnancy, **atrial ectopy** and **palpitations** may increase, but this is **not a contraindication** to pregnancy.
5. Further cardiac workup is unlikely to change risk stratification in patients with **mild MVP**, **mild mitral regurgitation**, and **identified PACs**.
6. An **event monitor** is not helpful for pre-pregnancy risk stratification when **PACs are already identified on ECG**.
7. **Exercise testing** is not indicated in patients with **low pregnancy risk** and excellent **exercise tolerance**.
8. **β-Blocker therapy** is unnecessary for treating symptomatic PACs in patients at **low risk for cardiovascular complications** during pregnancy.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Risk is low in patients with an otherwise normal echocardiogram and excellent exercise tolerance.
3. Symptomatic palpitations and PACs are often benign in MVP and do not indicate structural heart disease.
4. These rhythm changes are physiological and do not necessitate intervention.
6. Event monitors are useful only when ECG findings are inconclusive.
7. Exercise testing may help clarify risk only in patients with uncertain or higher baseline cardiovascular risk.
8. β-Blockers such as **metoprolol succinate** may affect the fetus, and are reserved for cases where benefit outweighs risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All women with **cardiovascular disease** should receive **pregnancy counseling** before conception.
2. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease anticipating pregnancy should undergo **multidisciplinary evaluation** with a **cardiologist**, **maternal-fetal medicine specialist**, and **obstetric anesthesiologist**.
3. The **cardio-obstetrics team** manages cardiovascular patients from **preconception through postpartum**.
4. **Modified World Health Organization (WHO) pregnancy risk classification** is the most accurate system for assessing cardiovascular risk in pregnancy.
5. **Exercise testing** to assess **heart rate response** and **maximal oxygen consumption** may be used in risk stratification.
6. Cardiovascular conditions associated with **high maternal or fetal risk** in pregnancy include:
   - **Pulmonary hypertension**
   - **Peripartum cardiomyopathy with residual left ventricular dysfunction**
   - **Severe left ventricular dysfunction**
   - **Severe mitral or aortic stenosis**
   - **Mechanical valves**
   - **Coarctation with residual gradient**
   - **Marked ascending aorta dilatation**
7. Patients with **Marfan syndrome** and an **aortic diameter ≥4.5 cm** should undergo **aortic repair before pregnancy**.
8. Patients with **uncomplicated small patent ductus arteriosus**, **mild pulmonary stenosis**, **mild MVP**, and **repaired simple congenital lesions** have **no increased risk during pregnancy**.
9. Patients at **low cardiovascular risk** may be cared for and deliver in **non-specialty hospitals**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. This evaluation ensures a shared decision-making process for managing pregnancy and delivery safely.
4. The modified WHO risk classification ranges from Class I (lowest risk) to Class IV (pregnancy contraindicated).
6. Patients with these conditions should deliver in centers experienced in managing cardiac disease in pregnancy.
8. Examples of repaired lesions include **atrial septal defect**, **ventricular septal defect**, and **anomalous pulmonary venous drainage**.
