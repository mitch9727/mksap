### 🫠 Cardiology: Peripartum Cardiomyopathy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** may present with **nonspecific symptoms** including **exercise intolerance**, **fatigue**, **shortness of breath**, **cough**, or **wheezing**.
2. Patients with these symptoms, particularly in the **early postpartum period** and those with **risk factors**, should be evaluated for **heart failure**.
3. **Risk factors** for peripartum cardiomyopathy include **multiparity**, **age older than 30 years**, **multifetal pregnancy**, **gestational hypertension**, **preeclampsia**, **history of peripartum cardiomyopathy**, and **tocolytic therapy**.
4. **Delays in diagnosis** of peripartum cardiomyopathy are common and contribute to **increased mortality**.
5. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is the best initial imaging modality to evaluate for **peripartum cardiomyopathy** in symptomatic patients.
6. **Spontaneous coronary artery dissection** may occur in the **peripartum period**, most commonly in the **first month postpartum**.
7. **Conservative, noninterventional therapy** is preferred for most patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection.
8. **Chest computed tomography (CT) with pulmonary embolism protocol** is not preferred when symptoms are gradual in onset and more consistent with **cardiomyopathy** than **venous thromboembolism**.
9. **Upper respiratory infections** may mimic early signs of heart failure, but features such as **dyspnea**, **hypotension**, and **tachycardia** warrant evaluation for **cardiomyopathy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These symptoms are often mistaken for normal changes of pregnancy or postpartum fatigue.
2. Evaluation should not be delayed, especially in patients with **multiple concurrent risk factors**.
3. These risk factors are associated with myocardial stress or increased hemodynamic burden during pregnancy.
4. Nonspecific presentation often leads to misdiagnosis or late recognition.
5. Echocardiography assesses **left ventricular function** and can confirm **reduced ejection fraction**.
6. Coronary dissection presents as myocardial infarction and should be considered in patients with chest pain.
7. Most cases resolve without stenting or surgery unless ongoing ischemia or hemodynamic instability is present.
8. This patient's subacute symptoms (e.g., nocturnal cough, gradual dyspnea) are atypical for **pulmonary embolism**.
9. In the presence of hypotension and tachycardia, further investigation is essential to exclude **heart failure**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** is defined as **left ventricular systolic dysfunction** with an **ejection fraction <45%**, recognized **toward the end of pregnancy** or **in the months after delivery** in the absence of another identifiable cause.
2. Patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy should be **co-managed by a cardiologist** and receive **guideline-directed medical therapy** during pregnancy.
3. Recommended therapies during pregnancy include **β-blockers**, **digoxin**, **hydralazine**, and **nitrates**.
4. **Diuretics** should be used at the **lowest effective dose** to reduce the risk of **placental hypoperfusion**.
5. **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**, **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, and **aldosterone antagonists** are **teratogenic** and should be **avoided until after delivery**.
6. **Anticoagulation** should be considered in pregnant patients with **left ventricular ejection fraction <30%** due to high thromboembolism risk.
7. **Anticoagulation duration** is typically **6 to 8 weeks postpartum**, unless ejection fraction normalizes earlier.
8. Patients with **severe refractory heart failure** should be **referred to a specialty center** for advanced care.
9. Most patients recover **left ventricular function within 6 months**, but some may have **persistent severe cardiomyopathy** or **major cardiovascular events**.
10. **Prognostic factors** for poor recovery include **severe left ventricular dysfunction or dilation at presentation**, **older maternal age**, and **multiparity**.
11. **Subsequent pregnancy** in patients with prior peripartum cardiomyopathy may cause **recurrent or worsened left ventricular dysfunction**, potentially leading to **clinical deterioration or death**.
12. Patients with **persistent left ventricular dysfunction** after peripartum cardiomyopathy should be **counseled about the risks of future pregnancy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Diagnosis requires exclusion of other causes of cardiomyopathy in the peripartum period.
2. Early collaboration improves maternal and fetal outcomes.
3. These agents are safe in pregnancy and target both preload and afterload.
4. Excessive diuresis can compromise uteroplacental perfusion.
5. These agents should be initiated **only postpartum** to avoid fetal risk.
6. Hypercoagulability in peripartum cardiomyopathy increases embolic risk.
7. Shorter duration may be appropriate if ejection fraction improves promptly.
8. Specialized centers may offer **mechanical circulatory support** or **transplant evaluation**.
9. Monitoring ejection fraction helps determine prognosis and guide follow-up.
10. These factors correlate with lower likelihood of full cardiac recovery.
11. Risks of recurrence should be carefully considered before conceiving again.
12. Counseling should emphasize the high risk of morbidity or mortality.
