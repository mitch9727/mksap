### 🫠 Heart Failure: Peripartum Cardiomyopathy and Pregnancy Planning

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** is defined as **left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <45%** occurring toward the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery without another identifiable cause.
2. **Risk factors** for peripartum cardiomyopathy include **multiparity**, **maternal age >30 years**, **multifetal pregnancy**, **gestational hypertension**, **preeclampsia**, **tocolytic therapy**, and **prior history of peripartum cardiomyopathy**.
3. Patients with **peripartum cardiomyopathy** may present with **nonspecific symptoms** such as **exercise intolerance**, **fatigue**, **shortness of breath**, **cough**, or **wheezing**, especially in the **early postpartum period**.
4. **β-Blockers**, **digoxin**, **hydralazine**, and **nitrates** are guideline-directed medical therapies for **peripartum cardiomyopathy** during pregnancy.
5. **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**, **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, and **aldosterone antagonists** are **teratogenic** and should be **avoided during pregnancy**.
6. **Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** should be avoided in pregnancy due to **unknown safety profiles**.
7. **Anticoagulation** should be considered in **pregnant patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy** and **LV ejection fraction <30%** due to increased risk of **thromboembolism**.
8. **Duration of anticoagulation** in peripartum cardiomyopathy is generally **6 to 8 weeks postpartum**, or may be discontinued earlier if **ejection fraction normalizes**.
9. Patients with **persistent LV dysfunction** after an episode of peripartum cardiomyopathy should be **counseled about the risks** of future pregnancy, including **cardiac deterioration** and **maternal death**.
10. **ACE inhibitors** like **lisinopril** should be **discontinued** before a planned pregnancy due to **teratogenic effects**.
11. **Metoprolol**, a β-blocker, is considered **pregnancy category C** and may be **continued during pregnancy** if the benefits outweigh the risks.
12. **Digoxin** is generally **safe during pregnancy**, but not indicated in asymptomatic patients.
13. **Furosemide** and other diuretics should be used **only when needed** and at the **lowest effective dose** to avoid **placental hypoperfusion**.
14. **Most patients** with peripartum cardiomyopathy eventually **recover LV function**, though some have **persistent cardiomyopathy** or **major cardiovascular events**.
15. In patients with **refractory heart failure** from peripartum cardiomyopathy, **referral to a specialty center** is recommended.

#### 💬 Extra
3. These symptoms may overlap with common postpartum changes, contributing to delayed diagnosis and increased mortality.
4. These medications are considered safe and effective for managing heart failure during pregnancy.
5. These drugs are avoided due to known teratogenic effects, including renal anomalies and fetal demise.
6. There are no adequate human studies confirming the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors during pregnancy.
7. The prothrombotic state of pregnancy combined with severe LV dysfunction increases thromboembolic risk.
8. If recovery occurs more quickly, anticoagulation duration may be adjusted accordingly.
9. Risk remains elevated even in women with partial recovery of LV function, particularly with subsequent pregnancies.
10. Lisinopril is FDA pregnancy category D and associated with fetal renal toxicity and death.
11. Discontinuing metoprolol may precipitate heart failure decompensation; monitoring is necessary.
12. Although digoxin has low fetal risk, it provides no additional benefit in stable, asymptomatic individuals.
13. Diuretics may reduce intravascular volume and uteroplacental blood flow, so careful dosing is essential.
14. Persistent dysfunction or events occur in ~13% of cases based on prospective studies.
15. Advanced therapies may be required in severe or treatment-resistant cases.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** occurs during late pregnancy or early postpartum and is defined by **left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <45%** without other identifiable causes.
2. **Symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy** are often **nonspecific**, and diagnosis may be delayed, contributing to **increased mortality**.
3. **Anticoagulation** is recommended in **peripartum cardiomyopathy** with **LV ejection fraction <30%** during pregnancy due to **high thromboembolic risk**.
4. **Guideline-directed therapy** for peripartum cardiomyopathy in pregnancy includes **β-blockers**, **digoxin**, **hydralazine**, and **nitrates**.
5. **ACE inhibitors**, **angiotensin receptor blockers**, and **aldosterone antagonists** should be **avoided until after delivery** due to **teratogenicity**.
6. **Most patients** with peripartum cardiomyopathy **recover LV function**, but approximately **13%** experience **persistent severe cardiomyopathy** or **major cardiovascular events**.
7. **Subsequent pregnancy** in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy—particularly with **persistent LV dysfunction**—is associated with **clinical deterioration** or **maternal death**.
8. Patients with **severe refractory heart failure** from peripartum cardiomyopathy should be **referred to a specialty center**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Symptoms like fatigue, dyspnea, and cough may mimic normal postpartum physiology, leading to underdiagnosis.
3. Pregnancy increases thrombotic risk due to hypercoagulability, particularly when cardiac output is low.
4. These agents help control symptoms and improve hemodynamics without teratogenic risk.
5. These agents interfere with fetal renal and cardiovascular development and are contraindicated during pregnancy.
6. Recovery typically occurs within 6 months postpartum; however, a subset of patients sustain permanent dysfunction.
7. Counseling should emphasize the elevated risk for deterioration even in those with apparent recovery.
8. Specialty centers can provide advanced therapies, such as mechanical circulatory support, when indicated.
