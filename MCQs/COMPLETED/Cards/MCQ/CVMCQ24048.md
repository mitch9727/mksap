### 🫀 Cardiology: Supraventricular Tachycardia Management in Pregnancy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In **hemodynamically stable pregnant patients** with symptomatic **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)**, the first‑line therapy is **vagal maneuvers**, such as the **Valsalva maneuver** or **carotid sinus massage**.
2. When **SVT** persists after vagal maneuvers during pregnancy, **intravenous adenosine** is the **treatment of choice** to restore sinus rhythm.
3. **Adenosine** is **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category C** but is considered the **safest acute antiarrhythmic** for SVT in pregnancy, with **no known teratogenic effects**.
4. **Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)** is the most common mechanism of SVT during pregnancy and usually terminates with **adenosine**.
5. **Synchronized electrical cardioversion** should be reserved for **pregnant patients with SVT** who are **hemodynamically unstable** or refractory to vagal maneuvers, adenosine, and atrioventricular‑node–blocking drugs.
6. Maternal cardioversion in pregnancy requires **conscious sedation** with **obstetric team participation** and **continuous fetal monitoring**.
7. **Amiodarone** is **contraindicated** for the treatment of SVT in pregnancy because of **fetal toxicity** and limited efficacy for this arrhythmia.
8. **β‑Adrenergic blockers (β‑blockers)** such as **metoprolol** can be used to **prevent recurrent episodes** of SVT during pregnancy when needed after acute termination.
9. **Catheter ablation** may be considered during pregnancy for **recurrent or drug‑refractory AVNRT** when symptoms remain significant despite medical therapy.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Vagal maneuvers transiently increase vagal tone and slow atrioventricular nodal conduction, interrupting re‑entrant circuits.
2. The **plasma half‑life** of adenosine is **<10 seconds**, minimizing sustained fetal exposure.
3. Case reports of fetal adverse effects with adenosine have not been confirmed in larger series.
4. **AVNRT** involves dual atrioventricular nodal pathways forming a re‑entry circuit dependent on nodal conduction.
5. Hemodynamic instability includes maternal hypotension, heart failure, chest pain, or altered mental status.
6. Fetal monitoring detects transient fetal bradycardia that can occur during maternal cardioversion.
7. **Amiodarone** crosses the placenta and has been associated with **fetal hypothyroidism** and **growth restriction**.
8. β‑Blocker prophylaxis is usually initiated with **cardio‑selective agents** after assessing maternal blood pressure and fetal growth.
9. Modern ablation systems use **three‑dimensional electro‑anatomic mapping** to minimize or eliminate fluoroscopic radiation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Because **safety data are limited**, most **cardiovascular medications** are **not FDA‑approved** for pregnancy and should be prescribed **only when the expected maternal benefit outweighs fetal risk** at the **lowest effective dose**.
2. **β‑Adrenergic blockers (β‑blockers)** cross the placenta and are present in human breast milk, so **fetal and newborn heart‑rate monitoring** is recommended when they are used during pregnancy or lactation.
3. **Labetalol** is the **preferred β‑blocker** for **hypertension management** in pregnancy, whereas **metoprolol** is preferred when β‑blockade is needed for **heart failure** or **arrhythmia control**.
4. **Atenolol** is generally **avoided during pregnancy** because it has been linked to **premature delivery** and **small‑for‑gestational‑age infants**.
5. **HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)** are **contraindicated** in pregnancy and should be **discontinued at least 6 weeks (preferably 12 weeks) before planned conception**.
6. **Sotalol** and **flecainide** have been used **safely** to prevent **recurrent tachyarrhythmias** during pregnancy when β‑blockers are inadequate or contraindicated.
7. The **LactMed database** provides comprehensive information on **medications and breastfeeding**, including potential adverse effects and safer therapeutic alternatives.
8. **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**—including **captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril**—are **contraindicated throughout pregnancy** because they are **teratogenic in the first trimester** and can cause **fetal or neonatal renal failure** when taken in the second or third trimester.
9. **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** and **direct renin inhibitors** such as **aliskiren** are likewise **contraindicated in pregnancy** for the same risks of teratogenicity and fetal/neonatal kidney injury.
10. **Intravenous adenosine** has **no documented effect on fetal heart rate** when used to treat maternal supraventricular tachycardia during pregnancy.
11. **Low-dose aspirin (≤ 81 mg/day)** is considered **safe for both pregnancy and breastfeeding**.
12. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**—including **apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban**—carry **insufficient safety data**, so **pregnancy and lactation should be avoided** while receiving these agents.
13. The ultra–short-acting β-blocker **esmolol** is a **second-line option** in pregnancy but produces **more pronounced fetal bradycardia** than other β-blockers.
14. **Diltiazem and verapamil** (non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers) are **second-line agents** for maternal SVT; rapid intravenous administration can cause **maternal hypotension**, and they are occasionally used for **fetal SVT**.
15. **Sodium nitroprusside** is **contraindicated in pregnancy** owing to the risk of **fetal thiocyanate toxicity**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Dose minimization reduces fetal drug exposure while still achieving therapeutic goals.
2. Monitoring helps identify fetal bradycardia, a known effect of β‑blockade.
3. **Labetalol** has combined α‑ and β‑blocking properties that maintain uteroplacental blood flow.
4. Observational studies associated **atenolol** with impaired fetal growth when used early in pregnancy.
5. Cholesterol synthesis is critical for fetal development, underpinning statin contraindication.
6. Both agents have acceptable maternal‑fetal safety profiles in published case series.
7. The **National Library of Medicine** maintains **LactMed** as a publicly accessible evidence‑based resource.
8. ACE-inhibitor exposure after organogenesis disrupts fetal renal blood flow, leading to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.
9. Like ACE inhibitors, ARBs impede the renin-angiotensin system; fetal effects mirror those seen with ACE-inhibitor exposure.
10. The supplemental table explicitly notes “No change in fetal heart rate” with adenosine.
11. Low-dose aspirin is widely used for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis and has no adverse lactation signal.
12. Registry data for DOACs are sparse; animal studies do not suggest teratogenicity, but human risk remains undetermined.
13. Esmolol’s rapid metabolism (t½ ≈ 9 min) permits tight titration but still crosses the placenta.
14. Maternal hypotension from rapid CCB infusion can compromise uteroplacental perfusion; slow bolus or oral dosing mitigates this risk.
15. Prolonged nitroprusside infusion generates cyanide and thiocyanate metabolites that readily cross the placenta.
