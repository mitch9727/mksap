### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Anticoagulation for Mechanical Heart Valve During Pregnancy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In **pregnant patients with a mechanical heart valve**, the preferred anticoagulation strategy is to switch from **warfarin** to **low‑molecular‑weight heparin (LMWH)** during gestational weeks 6 through 12, resume **warfarin** until week 36, and then use **intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH)** for delivery.
2. **Warfarin** administration in the **first trimester of pregnancy** can cause **warfarin embryopathy**, and the teratogenic risk is greatest when the maternal daily dose exceeds **5 mg**.
3. Continuous use of **LMWH** or **UFH** during pregnancy is safer for the fetus than **warfarin** but is associated with a **higher risk of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis**.
4. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** such as **apixaban** are **contraindicated** in patients with **mechanical heart valves** and have insufficient safety data for use during pregnancy.
5. Pregnant patients with a mechanical valve who enter **preterm labor while receiving warfarin** require **cesarean delivery** because warfarin crosses the placenta and increases the risk of **fetal intracranial hemorrhage** with vaginal delivery.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This regimen balances maternal protection against valve thrombosis with fetal safety: weeks 6–12 encompass organogenesis, and withdrawing warfarin before delivery minimizes neonatal bleeding risk.
2. Warfarin embryopathy classically causes nasal and skeletal abnormalities; risk rises sharply above the 5 mg/day dose threshold.
3. LMWH and UFH do not cross the placenta but must be monitored closely (anti‑Xa levels or activated partial thromboplastin time) to ensure adequate anticoagulation.
4. Trials such as RE‑ALIGN showed increased thrombosis with DOACs in mechanical valves, and all DOACs cross the placenta to some extent.
5. Warfarin’s placental transfer creates a bleeding hazard during the mechanical stresses of vaginal delivery, so cesarean section is recommended if labor begins while the mother is anticoagulated.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pregnancy** induces a **hypercoagulable state**, so pregnant individuals who require chronic anticoagulation need carefully monitored therapy.
2. **Prepregnancy counseling** is recommended for women who will need **long‑term anticoagulation** during pregnancy so they can make informed choices about drug selection and maternal versus fetal risk.
3. **Warfarin**, **unfractionated heparin**, and **low‑molecular‑weight heparin** can each be used during pregnancy when dosages are adjusted to achieve therapeutic targets.
4. **Warfarin** is **discontinued before delivery** to prevent **fetal intracranial hemorrhage** if spontaneous labor occurs.
5. Pregnant patients with a **mechanical valve prosthesis** should be managed by a **multidisciplinary cardio‑obstetrics team** and should undergo **frequent anticoagulation monitoring** throughout pregnancy.
6. When **low‑molecular‑weight heparin** is prescribed for a pregnant patient with a mechanical heart valve, dosing must be **adjusted by anti‑Xa levels** to ensure adequate anticoagulation.
7. Women who become pregnant while taking a **direct oral anticoagulant** should switch promptly to **heparin or warfarin** because safety data on DOACs in pregnancy are limited.
8. For **venous thromboembolism** prophylaxis during pregnancy, **weight‑based low‑molecular‑weight heparin** or **intravenous/subcutaneous unfractionated heparin** targeting an **activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) twice control** is recommended from **week 6 until delivery**.
9. In **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**, women who can maintain a therapeutic **international normalized ratio (INR)** with **≤5 mg/day of warfarin** may continue warfarin during **weeks 6‑12 of gestation**; otherwise, **UFH** or **weight‑based LMWH** are alternatives.
10. During **weeks 13‑37** of pregnancy, patients with **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation** may receive **subcutaneous UFH**, **weight‑based LMWH**, or **therapeutic‑INR warfarin**.
11. In **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**, **intravenous UFH** (aPTT 2 × control) is the anticoagulant of choice from **week 37 to term**.
12. For pregnant patients with a **mechanical heart valve** whose daily warfarin dose is **≤5 mg**, **continuing warfarin** during **weeks 6‑12** carries a **Class 2a** recommendation.
13. If the required **warfarin dose exceeds 5 mg/day** in a pregnant patient with a mechanical valve, **intravenous UFH** or **anti‑factor Xa–adjusted LMWH** are preferred during **weeks 6‑12**.
14. From **weeks 13‑37** of gestation, patients with a **mechanical valve prosthesis** should receive **therapeutic‑INR warfarin**.
15. During **week 37 to term**, **intravenous UFH** targeting an **aPTT twice control** is recommended for patients with a **mechanical valve prosthesis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Increased levels of clotting factors (VII, VIII, X, and fibrinogen) and reduced protein S activity contribute to pregnancy‑related hypercoagulability.
2. Counseling covers the teratogenicity of warfarin, thrombosis risk of heparin‑based regimens, and delivery planning.
3. Target international normalized ratio (INR) for warfarin is typically 2.5–3.5 for mechanical aortic valves, while anti‑Xa targets for LMWH are 1.0–1.2 U/mL 4‑6 h post‑dose.
4. Switching to UFH or planned cesarean ensures minimal fetal exposure to warfarin during labor and delivery.
5. Disciplines involved include cardiology, maternal‑fetal medicine, hematology, and anesthesiology.
6. Standard weight‑based LMWH dosing may under‑anticoagulate because of the increased renal clearance and volume of distribution in pregnancy.
7. Because DOACs lack reversal agents suitable for pregnancy and cross the placenta, guideline committees advise against their use.
8. Weight‑based LMWH dosing typically uses the patient’s pregnancy‑adjusted weight and aims for anti‑factor Xa levels of 0.8‑1.2 U/mL 4‑6 h post‑dose.
9. The **Class 2a** and **2b** designations reflect guideline strength of recommendation, with **Class 2a** indicating moderate benefit and **Class 2b** indicating weaker evidence.
10. Switching to UFH near delivery allows rapid reversal of anticoagulation if emergent cesarean section is required.
