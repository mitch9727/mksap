### 🫀 Aortic Disease: Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Surveillance and Surgical Thresholds

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs)** of the ascending aorta or aortic root that measure **3.5 – 4.4 cm** should be imaged **annually** to monitor diameter.  
2. When the TAA diameter reaches **4.5 – 5.4 cm**, **imaging every 6 months** is recommended.  
3. **More-frequent imaging** (shorter than 6 months) is indicated when the aneurysm shows **rapid expansion (>0.5 cm per year)** or is **approaching the operative threshold**.  
4. In degenerative disease of the ascending aorta, **surgical repair is warranted when the diameter exceeds 5.5 cm**.  
5. **Rapid growth alone can trigger surgery**: operative repair is indicated for expansion **≥0.3 cm per year in two consecutive years** *or* **≥0.5 cm in a single year**, even if the diameter is <5.5 cm.  
6. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the preferred surveillance modality for **aneurysms <5.0 cm**.  
7. **Computed-tomography angiography (CTA)** or **magnetic-resonance angiography (MRA)** is recommended for **larger aneurysms** or when a **bicuspid aortic valve** limits TTE visualization.  
8. The **target blood pressure** for patients with TAA is **<130/80 mm Hg**.  
9. **β-Blockers** are the **first-line antihypertensive agents** for patients with TAA.  
10. **Combined β-blocker + losartan therapy** has evidence of slowing aneurysm growth in **Marfan syndrome**, but it is **not routinely indicated** in degenerative TAA without Marfan syndrome.  
11. **Genetic testing** for heritable aortopathies is appropriate **only when clinical features suggest a syndrome** (e.g., Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos) **or when a first-degree relative carries a known pathogenic variant**.  
12. When a TAA is **rapidly expanding or within ~0.3 cm of the 5.5 cm threshold**, **re-imaging at ~3 months** is reasonable to guide timely surgical referral.

#### 💬 Extra
3. A diameter increase of **0.3 cm in 6 months projects to ≥0.5 cm/year**, meeting the guideline definition of rapid expansion.  
6. **TTE** offers accurate measurement of the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta for **aneurysms <5.0 cm**, minimizing radiation exposure and cost.  
7. **CTA and MRA** provide superior spatial resolution for **aneurysms ≥5.0 cm**, arch involvement, or settings where **bicuspid aortic valve anatomy** obscures TTE windows.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Screening for **thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)** is indicated in asymptomatic patients with **bicuspid aortic valve** and **genetic syndromes** such as **Marfan syndrome**, **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome**, and **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**.
2. **First-degree relatives** of patients with aortic disease should undergo **genetic testing or aortic imaging**, depending on the features of the index case.
3. **Genetic testing** should be offered in patients with TAA or dissection who have **clinical features of a syndromic condition**, **a family history**, or **onset before age 60**.
4. If a **pathogenic genetic variant** is found, **first-degree relatives** should undergo **variant testing**, and if positive, receive **aortic imaging**.
5. If no genetic variant is identified, **first-degree relatives** should still receive **aortic imaging screening**.
6. If the index case has a **sporadic aneurysm at age ≥60 years**, **aortic imaging** alone is recommended for first-degree relatives.
7. Accurate measurement of the **aortic cross-sectional diameter** must be performed **perpendicular to the aorta's long axis**, and modality differences may affect the result.
8. **TAA rupture** is the **leading cause of death**, and risk of rupture increases with **aneurysm size**, **faster expansion**, and presence of **connective tissue disorders**.
9. The **average TAA expansion rate** is **0.1 cm/year**, but expansion is more rapid in patients with **Marfan syndrome**, **bicuspid aortic valve**, **pregnancy**, or **ascending aortic involvement**.
10. **Transthoracic echocardiography**, **CT angiography**, and **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** are all used for surveillance of TAA, with **TTE preferred** for aneurysms <5.0 cm if visualization is adequate.
11. **CT angiography (CTA)** provides **100% sensitivity** and **98%–99% specificity** for diagnosing thoracic aortic aneurysms.
12. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** is contraindicated in some patients with **implanted pacemakers or defibrillators**.
13. **Some gadolinium contrast agents used in MRA** are contraindicated in patients with **advanced kidney disease** (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m²).
14. **Aortography** requires **power injection within the aorta** and is considered an **invasive procedure**.
15. **Catheter manipulation during aortography** may **worsen aortic dissection**.
16. Patients with **thoracic aortic aneurysm 5.0–5.4 cm** from **degenerative conditions** (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve) should undergo **imaging every 6 months**.
17. **Patients with Marfan syndrome and aneurysms ≥5.0 cm** are typically referred for **surgical repair**, and surveillance is not typically continued beyond this threshold.

#### 💬 Extra
2–6. The decision to pursue genetic testing vs. imaging is based on clinical features, age, and familial history of aneurysmal disease.
2. Genes associated with TAA syndromes include **FBN1**, **TGFBR1**, **TGFBR2**, **COL3A1**, and **MYH11**.
3. Different imaging techniques may yield variable diameters; consistency in modality is important for serial comparisons.
4. Surveillance intervals should be individualized when higher-risk features are present (e.g., pregnancy or syndromic diagnoses).
11. These performance metrics are superior to echocardiographic modalities for detecting dissection.
12. This limitation makes MRA unsuitable in some patients needing long-term device therapy.
13. Group I gadolinium agents are unsafe in severe kidney disease; Group II is safer, and Group III is uncertain.
14. The invasiveness and need for contrast limit its role in routine surveillance.
15. Iatrogenic worsening of dissection is a known procedural risk.
16. This frequency aligns with progression risk and potential surgical planning.
17. ACC/AHA guidelines suggest elective repair once the 5.0 cm threshold is reached in Marfan syndrome.
