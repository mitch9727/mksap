### 🫠 Aortic Disease: Incidental Aortic Atheroma Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic atheromatous plaques (atheromas)** commonly occur in patients with **atherosclerosis in other vascular beds**.
2. The presence of **aortic atheroma** represents **atherosclerotic vascular disease** and warrants consideration of **antiplatelet and statin therapy**.
3. **Aspirin and high-intensity statin therapy** should be initiated in asymptomatic patients with an **incidentally discovered aortic atheroma**.
4. **Carotid duplex ultrasonography** is **not indicated** in asymptomatic patients with aortic atheroma who lack signs or symptoms of carotid artery stenosis.
5. **Oral anticoagulation therapy** is **not indicated** in asymptomatic patients with aortic atheroma, even though large or mobile plaques may increase embolic risk.
6. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is not useful for asymptomatic aortic atheroma, as no effective medical or surgical intervention is available based on TEE findings.
7. **Anticoagulation therapy** does not reduce thromboembolic events more than **antiplatelet therapy** in patients with aortic atheroma.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Aortic atheromas are often detected incidentally on imaging studies such as CT scans.
3. The patient in the vignette was asymptomatic and found to have aortic atheroma on CT imaging.
4. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force** recommends against screening asymptomatic patients for **carotid artery stenosis**.
5. Aortic atheromas **>4 mm in diameter** or with a **mobile component** are more likely to be associated with **systemic thromboembolism**.
6. There is **no proven medical or surgical therapy** shown to reduce the incidence of complications related to aortic atheroma.
7. Current evidence does not support using anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy in asymptomatic cases.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic atheromas** are frequently found in patients with **atherosclerosis in other vascular beds**.
2. The most common complication of **aortic atheroma** is **systemic thromboembolism**, including **transient ischemic attack** or **stroke**.
3. **Aortic atheromas >4 mm in diameter** or with a **mobile component** are more likely to be associated with **thromboembolism** than smaller, non-mobile plaques.
4. **Aortic atheromas** detected on imaging should prompt treatment as a **coronary artery disease (CAD) risk equivalent** with **antiplatelet and statin therapies**.
5. **Anticoagulation** does not provide benefit in **asymptomatic patients with aortic atheroma**.

#### 💬 Extra
4. CAD risk equivalent implies aggressive risk factor modification is warranted, similar to patients with known coronary artery disease.
5. Absence of symptoms limits the justification for systemic anticoagulation, even when plaques appear high-risk on imaging.
