### 🫠 Peripheral Artery Disease: Post-Revascularization Antithrombotic Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic limb-threatening ischemia** requires **urgent surgical or endovascular limb revascularization** in patients who are good candidates for intervention.
2. Following revascularization for **chronic limb-threatening ischemia**, **antiplatelet therapy** is mandatory to reduce the risk for **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, and **peripheral arterial events**.
3. The **combination of low-dose aspirin and low-dose rivaroxaban** is more effective than **aspirin monotherapy** in preventing a composite of **acute limb ischemia**, **major amputation**, **myocardial infarction**, **ischemic stroke**, or **cardiovascular death** in patients after peripheral arterial revascularization.
4. **Vitamin K antagonist therapy** such as **warfarin** is not more effective than antiplatelet monotherapy for peripheral artery disease and increases the risk of **major bleeding**, including **intracerebral bleeding**.
5. **No change in antithrombotic therapy** after revascularization for peripheral artery disease is inappropriate, as **combination therapy with rivaroxaban and aspirin** reduces the risk of future ischemic events.
6. **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy** is not indicated following successful limb revascularization unless there is a **poorly healing ulceration** or **no alternative treatment options**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Limb-threatening ischemia is the most severe form of peripheral artery disease and requires immediate revascularization to preserve limb viability.
2. Risk factor modification includes antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, lipid-lowering therapy, and diabetes management.
3. Evidence for the efficacy of rivaroxaban plus aspirin in this setting comes from the VOYAGER and COMPASS trials.
4. Warfarin is associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications and does not improve vascular outcomes in peripheral artery disease.
5. Aspirin alone is not sufficient to reduce the composite risk of ischemic complications in high-risk patients after revascularization.
6. Hyperbaric oxygen is a salvage therapy typically reserved for refractory wounds or infections in ischemic limbs.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Antiplatelet monotherapy** with **low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel** is recommended in **peripheral artery disease** to reduce the risk of **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, and **peripheral arterial events**, including **chronic limb-threatening ischemia**.
2. There is **no compelling evidence** supporting **dual antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin plus clopidogrel) in patients with peripheral artery disease unless they have undergone **revascularization**.
3. In the **CHARISMA trial**, dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease reduced **myocardial infarction** and **ischemic events**, but increased **bleeding risk**.
4. **Vitamin K antagonists** such as **warfarin** are not superior to **antiplatelet monotherapy** in peripheral artery disease and are associated with an increased risk for **major bleeding**, including **intracerebral hemorrhage**.
5. There is **no evidence** that **direct oral anticoagulant therapy alone** is superior to antiplatelet therapy in patients with peripheral artery disease.
6. The **combination of aspirin (100 mg daily) and rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily)** improves **major adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes** in patients with **peripheral artery disease**, based on data from the **COMPASS trial**.
7. In the **VOYAGER trial**, patients undergoing **surgical or endovascular revascularization** for peripheral artery disease had **fewer ischemic events** when treated with **aspirin plus rivaroxaban** versus **aspirin alone**.
8. **Major bleeding**, particularly **gastrointestinal bleeding**, was more common with the combination of **aspirin and rivaroxaban**, though **fatal or critical organ bleeding** was not significantly different compared with aspirin alone.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Antiplatelet therapy remains the foundation of secondary prevention in peripheral artery disease.
2. Dual therapy is generally reserved for postprocedural periods or high-risk anatomical situations.
3. Bleeding risk limits widespread use of dual antiplatelet therapy in peripheral artery disease.
4. Warfarin has historically been used for vascular conditions but is now avoided in most cases due to bleeding concerns.
5. Rivaroxaban monotherapy has not demonstrated superior efficacy over antiplatelet therapy in PAD.
6. The COMPASS trial included patients with coronary and peripheral artery disease and showed improved limb outcomes.
7. The VOYAGER PAD trial specifically assessed outcomes after revascularization in lower extremity disease.
8. Careful patient selection is needed to balance bleeding risk and ischemic benefit with combination therapy.
