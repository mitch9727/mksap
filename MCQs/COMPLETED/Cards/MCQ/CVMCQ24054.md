### 🫠 Peripheral Artery Disease: Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia and Anatomic Testing

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)** warrants **anatomic testing**, such as **computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen with runoff**, to determine the feasibility and approach for **revascularization**.
2. **CTA of the abdomen with runoff** provides detailed anatomic information to guide **endovascular or surgical revascularization** for **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**.
3. Patients with **CLTI**, including those with **rest pain**, **tissue ulceration**, or **gangrene**, should be referred for **revascularization** if symptoms persist despite standard therapy.
4. **Below-the-knee amputation** should not be the initial step in patients with **CLTI** who are candidates for **revascularization**.
5. **Toe-brachial index testing** is reserved for patients with **noncompressible vessels** on ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing or to assess **wound healing potential**.
6. **Intravenous heparin** is not indicated in **chronic ischemia** without signs of **acute limb ischemia**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This imaging modality is essential to assess aortic and iliac artery anatomy, particularly in suspected **Leriche syndrome**.
3. Standard therapy includes **exercise**, **antiplatelet agents**, **cilostazol**, and **wound care**.
5. This patient has low ABIs, confirming PAD, making **toe-brachial index testing unnecessary**.
6. Indications for intravenous heparin include **sudden limb pain**, **pallor**, or **paralysis**, not chronic rest pain.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)** testing is the most commonly used diagnostic modality for identifying **lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD)**.
2. A **resting ABI of 0.90 or less** is **diagnostic for PAD** and correlates with abnormalities on arterial imaging.
3. Patients with **claudication** typically have an ABI between **0.40 and 0.90**, while those with **ischemic rest pain**, **ulceration**, or **gangrene** have an ABI less than **0.40**.
4. A **resting ABI greater than 1.40** suggests **noncompressible, calcified arteries** and is considered **uninterpretable**.
5. In patients with **normal resting ABI** but high clinical suspicion for PAD, **exercise ABI testing** may confirm the diagnosis if there is a **postexercise drop in ankle pressure ≥30 mm Hg** or **ABI decline >20%**.
6. **Toe-brachial index testing** is used in patients with **noncompressible arteries**; a value less than **0.70** indicates **PAD**.
7. **CT angiography**, **magnetic resonance angiography**, and **arterial duplex ultrasonography** are used to define **anatomic location and severity** of PAD to guide revascularization.
8. **Invasive angiography** allows both **anatomic delineation** and potential **concurrent revascularization**.
9. **Segmental pressure measurements** and **pulse volume recordings** can help **localize PAD** in vascular lab evaluations.
10. An **ankle-brachial index (ABI)** of **0.91–0.99** is considered **borderline**, while an ABI between **0.41–0.90** indicates **mild to moderate peripheral artery disease (PAD)**, and an ABI less than **0.40** is consistent with **severe PAD**.
11. An **ABI greater than 1.40** is uninterpretable due to **noncompressible (calcified) vessels**.
12. **Arterial duplex ultrasonography** is a **noninvasive**, **inexpensive**, and **widely available** imaging modality for PAD but has **limited utility** in **pelvic stenoses** or **severe calcification**.
13. **Computed tomography (CT) angiography** is **widely available**, defines the **severity of PAD**, but carries risk for **contrast-induced nephropathy** and is **very expensive**.
14. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** is also useful in defining PAD severity but is **contraindicated** in many patients with **pacemakers or defibrillators**, and it carries risk for **nephrogenic systemic fibrosis** in patients with **severe kidney disease**.
15. In **pulse volume recording**, a **blunted waveform with broader width** indicates **moderate to severe PAD**, while a **sharp systolic upstroke and narrow waveform** is considered **normal**.
16. A **right-sided ABI of 0.70** is consistent with **mild to moderate PAD**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ABI is calculated as the **higher ankle pressure** divided by the **higher brachial pressure**.
2. ABI testing is recommended for all patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of PAD.
4. In such cases, **toe-brachial index testing** is required.
7. Imaging modality selection depends on clinical scenario and revascularization planning needs.
9. These tests help differentiate disease location (e.g., aortoiliac vs. femoropopliteal segments).
10. ABI classification ranges provide a standardized framework for diagnosis and staging of PAD.
11. Noncompressible arteries are often seen in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
12. Duplex ultrasound does not require contrast dye, making it safer in patients with kidney impairment.
13. CT angiography is useful for procedural planning but should be used cautiously in patients with renal insufficiency.
14. Gadolinium-based contrast agents used in MRA have differential safety profiles depending on renal function.
15. Pulse volume recordings help assess perfusion beyond ABI values alone.
16. The figure demonstrates discordant perfusion findings between the right and left limbs, supporting the PAD diagnosis.
