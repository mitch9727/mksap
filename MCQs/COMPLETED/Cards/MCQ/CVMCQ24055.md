### 🫀 Vascular Medicine: Acute Limb Ischemia

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute limb ischemia** is a **surgical emergency** and should be managed urgently.
2. Causes of **acute limb ischemia** include **thromboembolism**, **acute thrombosis** of an artery, **stent or bypass graft thrombosis**, **vessel dissection**, and **trauma**.
3. Patients with acute limb ischemia typically present with at least one of the “6 P's”: **paresthesia**, **pain**, **pallor**, **pulselessness**, **poikilothermia** (coolness), and **paralysis**.
4. Clinicians must maintain a **high index of suspicion** for acute limb ischemia, especially in patients with **atrial fibrillation**, **peripheral artery disease**, or **vascular risk factors**.
5. If acute limb ischemia is suspected, patients should receive **intravenous heparin** and urgent evaluation by a **vascular medicine specialist**.
6. **Diagnostic angiography** is preferred over **ankle-brachial index testing** for defining the anatomy and planning revascularization in suspected acute limb ischemia.
7. **Full-dose oral anticoagulants**, such as **rivaroxaban**, are not recommended in acute limb ischemia due to lack of evidence and potential procedural complications.
8. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** should be avoided when clinical features strongly support acute limb ischemia, to prevent delay in therapy.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Acute limb ischemia is a **limb- and life-threatening** event requiring immediate attention.
2. Acute thrombosis most commonly occurs at sites of **preexisting atherosclerosis**.
3. Not all patients will exhibit all six “P” signs, but presence of even one should raise suspicion.
4. Risk factors like **atrial fibrillation** increase embolic potential; peripheral artery disease raises thrombotic risk.
5. **Heparin** prevents propagation of thrombus and facilitates planned revascularization.
6. **Angiography** also enables simultaneous intervention if needed.
7. Oral agents like **rivaroxaban** have long half-lives that complicate urgent procedural planning.
8. **MRI** is more useful in alternative diagnoses such as **cellulitis**, **osteomyelitis**, or **crystal arthropathy**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute limb ischemia** is a **life-threatening manifestation** of **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**.
2. The **most common cause** of acute limb ischemia is **acute thrombosis** at the site of preexisting atherosclerotic disease, stent, or bypass graft.
3. **Atheroembolic events** may occur after **arterial manipulation** such as invasive angiography.
4. In contrast to other causes, **atheromatous emboli** are managed supportively with **risk factor modification**.
5. **Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin** should be started **immediately** upon suspicion of acute limb ischemia.
6. Consultation with **vascular specialists** should be initiated promptly to assess **limb salvageability**.
7. **Diagnostic angiography** should be performed to define the level of occlusion and guide therapy.
8. **Catheter-directed thrombolysis** can improve outcomes in acute limb ischemia.
9. After reperfusion, monitoring is required for **reocclusion**, **limb edema**, and **compartment syndrome**.
10. Symptoms of **compartment syndrome** include **severe pain**, **hypoesthesia**, and **leg weakness**; treatment requires **surgical fasciotomy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PAD is a chronic atherosclerotic condition; acute ischemia marks a severe complication.
2. Preexisting **arterial lesions** are vulnerable sites for **in-situ thrombosis**.
3. **Invasive procedures** can trigger microembolization from disrupted plaques.
4. Atheroembolism does not typically respond to revascularization; goals are secondary prevention.
5. **Unfractionated heparin** provides rapid anticoagulation and is easily reversible if needed.
6. Timely revascularization is critical to avoid limb loss or death.
7. Angiography can be both **diagnostic** and **interventional** in real-time.
8. Thrombolysis is particularly beneficial for patients with **distal occlusions** or who are **not surgical candidates**.
9. **Reperfusion injury** and edema increase **compartment pressure**, especially in prolonged ischemia.
10. Early **fasciotomy** prevents irreversible damage to nerves and muscle compartments.
