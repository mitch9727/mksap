### 🫠 Peripheral Artery Disease: Revascularization in Asymptomatic PAD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cigarette smoking** is the most important modifiable risk factor for **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**, and **smoking cessation** is imperative to improve survival and reduce major amputation risk.
2. **Smoking cessation** in patients with PAD is associated with **improved patency rates** after revascularization and **less disease progression**.
3. **Optimal management of vascular risk factors** such as **diabetes**, **hypertension**, and **dyslipidemia** is crucial for improving outcomes in PAD.
4. **Patients with asymptomatic PAD** should **not be referred for revascularization procedures**.
5. **Ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing** is not indicated in patients with **established PAD** who are **asymptomatic**.
6. **Cilostazol**, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is indicated only in patients with **claudication symptoms**, not in those with **asymptomatic PAD**.
7. **Iliac artery revascularization** is not indicated in **asymptomatic patients** with PAD.
8. There is **no indication for further imaging**, such as **CT angiography**, in **asymptomatic patients** after recent aortography.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Smoking cessation improves overall survival and reduces progression in patients with PAD.
3. Managing these risk factors lowers the likelihood of cardiovascular events and limb complications.
4. Revascularization is reserved for patients with symptoms or limb-threatening ischemia.
5. ABI is most useful in diagnosing PAD in symptomatic patients without prior imaging.
6. Cilostazol improves walking distance and quality of life in symptomatic patients.
7. This patient has no claudication or critical limb ischemia, making intervention unnecessary.
8. The patient had recent invasive aortography confirming diagnosis without current symptoms.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Revascularization** is not recommended in **asymptomatic patients** with **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**.
2. **Endovascular or surgical revascularization** is effective in relieving symptoms and improving wound healing in patients with **intermittent claudication** or **chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)**.
3. **Life-limiting claudication** unresponsive to **exercise**, **antiplatelet therapy**, and **cilostazol** is an indication for **revascularization referral**.
4. **Rest pain**, **ulceration**, or **gangrene** in PAD patients are indications for **revascularization consideration**.
5. **Patients with CLTI** and findings such as **ABI <0.40**, **flat waveform on pulse volume recording**, or **low/absent pedal flow on duplex ultrasonography** should be evaluated for **urgent revascularization**.
6. Revascularization decisions should be guided by a **multidisciplinary team** including specialists in **vascular surgery**, **radiology**, **cardiology**, or **podiatry**.
7. **Endovascular revascularization** has increased due to its **minimally invasive nature** and **lower perioperative risk**.
8. In patients with **isolated iliac artery disease**, **endovascular therapy** using **balloon angioplasty with stenting** is favored and has higher long-term success than angioplasty alone.
9. In **infrainguinal PAD** (femoral, popliteal, tibial arteries), **patency rates** are lower with endovascular therapy compared to iliac lesions.
10. **Surgical revascularization** is preferred in patients with **complex PAD anatomy**, such as **long chronic total occlusions** or **multisegment disease**.
11. **Hybrid revascularization**, combining surgical and endovascular techniques, is not currently guideline-recommended.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Intervention is not beneficial without symptoms or tissue loss.
3. Failure of conservative measures justifies escalation to revascularization.
5. These parameters reflect severe perfusion impairment needing urgent action.
6. Multidisciplinary evaluation improves risk assessment and procedural planning.
8. Iliac lesions respond better to endovascular techniques than distal lesions.
10. Surgical options such as endarterectomy or bypass are reserved for anatomically complex cases.
