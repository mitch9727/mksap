### 🦵 Peripheral Artery Disease: Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia Revascularization

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)** of the lower extremities should be treated with **revascularization** to restore limb perfusion.
2. **Surgical revascularization** is favored in patients with **CLTI** who have **long chronic total occlusions** or **multisegment disease**.
3. **Endovascular revascularization** is typically preferred in peripheral artery disease due to its **minimally invasive nature** and **lower perioperative risk**, but is less suitable in complex anatomy.
4. The **BEST-CLI trial** demonstrated that **surgical bypass** resulted in **lower rates of death or major adverse limb events** than endovascular therapy in CLTI patients with adequate saphenous vein conduit.
5. **Major amputation** should not be the primary treatment for CLTI if **revascularization is possible**, due to its associated **high morbidity and mortality**.
6. **Dapagliflozin**, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is **not contraindicated** in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease.
7. The **CANVAS trial** showed increased amputation risk with **canagliflozin**, but this finding has **not been replicated** in subsequent studies.
8. **Optimal medical therapy**, including **statins**, **antithrombotics**, **smoking cessation**, and **risk factor control**, is important but **insufficient alone** in the setting of CLTI with infection.
9. **Endovascular revascularization** is associated with a **lower risk of perioperative adverse events** compared to **surgical revascularization**.
10. **Surgical revascularization** includes procedures such as **surgical bypass** or **endarterectomy**.
11. **Hybrid revascularization** combines **surgical** and **endovascular** techniques in a single setting but is **not recommended by current clinical practice guidelines**.
12. In patients with **isolated iliac artery disease**, **endovascular revascularization** with **balloon angioplasty and stenting** is preferred due to **higher long-term success rates**.
13. **Infrainguinal peripheral artery disease**, involving **femoral**, **popliteal**, or **tibial arteries**, has **lower patency rates** following endovascular revascularization than iliac disease.

#### 💬 Extra
1. CLTI includes features such as **rest pain**, **ulceration**, or **gangrene**, and indicates urgent revascularization.
2. The presence of extensive disease makes surgical revascularization more durable than percutaneous options.
3. Although commonly preferred, endovascular approaches may have **inferior long-term patency** in complex disease.
4. The BEST-CLI study included **1830 patients** and was a landmark randomized trial comparing bypass versus endovascular therapy.
5. Amputation is reserved for patients with **nonviable limbs**, **severe infection**, or **no revascularization option**.
6. Initial concerns about amputation risk from SGLT2 inhibitors have largely been **disproved** for other agents in the class.
7. Subsequent research has shown **no increased risk** with dapagliflozin or empagliflozin.
8. In the presence of infection and ischemia, **revascularization is necessary** to enable wound healing.
9. The lower procedural risk has led to increased use of endovascular approaches in recent years.
10. These surgical techniques are especially useful for patients with complex vascular anatomy.
11. Although hybrid procedures are increasingly used, they have not yet been incorporated into guideline-based algorithms.
12. This preference is based on better durability and fewer reinterventions compared to angioplasty alone.
13. Anatomical and technical challenges contribute to reduced long-term success in distal vessel interventions.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Revascularization** is **not recommended** in **asymptomatic peripheral artery disease**.
2. **Revascularization** improves **functional capacity** and **wound healing** in patients with **intermittent claudication** or **chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)**.
3. Patients with **life-limiting claudication** despite **exercise training**, **antiplatelet therapy**, and **cilostazol** should be considered for **revascularization**.
4. Urgent revascularization should be considered in CLTI patients with **ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.40**, **flat pulse volume waveforms**, or **absent pedal flow** on duplex ultrasonography.
5. **Multidisciplinary teams** should guide revascularization decisions, especially for **complex cases**.
6. **Surgical revascularization** is preferred for **long or distal lesions**, whereas **proximal/focal lesions** are better suited to **endovascular therapy**.
7. **Endovascular options** include **balloon angioplasty**, **stenting**, and **atherectomy**.
8. For **isolated iliac disease**, **balloon angioplasty with stenting** offers better outcomes than angioplasty alone.
9. Patency rates for **infrainguinal endovascular interventions** (e.g., femoral, popliteal, tibial) are lower than for iliac disease.
10. **Hybrid revascularization** strategies are increasingly used but are **not yet guideline recommended**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Asymptomatic patients generally do not benefit from intervention unless disease progresses.
2. Revascularization may improve both quality of life and limb salvage in symptomatic patients.
3. This group includes patients whose symptoms interfere with activities of daily living or employment.
4. These findings support **noninvasive tests** to risk-stratify CLTI patients for urgent care.
5. Experts may include vascular surgeons, radiologists, cardiologists, and podiatrists.
6. Surgical bypass may be more durable and effective in **long-segment disease**.
7. Atherectomy is evolving but has not replaced more established modalities.
8. Iliac artery stenting is standard due to high success and low risk.
9. Durability of interventions is dependent on **location**, **vessel size**, and **technique used**.
10. Hybrid approaches combine the benefits of both techniques but lack robust comparative evidence.
