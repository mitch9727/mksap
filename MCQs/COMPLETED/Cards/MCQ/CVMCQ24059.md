### 🫠 Peripheral Artery Disease: Lipid Management in Statin-Intolerant Patients

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)** treatment focuses on **symptom reduction**, **functional improvement**, **tissue injury prevention**, and **aggressive risk factor modification**.
2. **Lipid management** is mandatory in patients with **PAD** and typically includes **statin therapy**.
3. For patients with **PAD** who are **statin intolerant**, alternatives such as **ezetimibe**, **proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors**, or **bempedoic acid** are reasonable options.
4. There is no clear **low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)** target in **PAD**, but guidelines recommend lowering **LDL-C** to **below 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)** in patients with **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
5. **β₁-selective β-blockers** are generally well tolerated in patients with **PAD** and may be used with caution if indicated for other reasons.
6. **Nonselective β-blockers**, such as **propranolol**, were historically associated with increased complications in severe **PAD**, but this concern does not apply to **β₁-selective agents** like **metoprolol**.
7. The **ACC/AHA guidelines** recommend a **blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg** in patients with **PAD**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Risk factor modification includes **lipid lowering**, **blood pressure control**, **smoking cessation**, and **glucose control** in diabetics.
3. This patient's prior intolerance to multiple statins justifies initiation of **ezetimibe** as the next step in LDL-C lowering therapy.
5. This patient was well-controlled on **metoprolol**, a β₁-selective blocker, and had no PAD symptom exacerbation, making discontinuation unnecessary.
6. The historical concern about β-blockers in PAD came from early studies of **nonselective agents**, not the cardioselective ones used today.
7. This patient’s blood pressure is well managed with **metoprolol and losartan**, eliminating the need for further medication adjustment.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cigarette smoking** is the most important **modifiable risk factor** for **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**, and **smoking cessation** reduces the risk of **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, **major amputation**, and disease progression.
2. **Diabetes mellitus** is a strong risk factor for **PAD**, but **intensive glucose control** has not been shown to reduce **macrovascular complications** such as **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, or **amputation**.
3. Patients with **PAD and diabetes** should follow **American Diabetes Association** guidelines and pay particular attention to **foot care**.
4. Some studies have suggested a possible association between **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** and **increased amputation risk** in patients with **PAD**, though findings are inconsistent.
5. Guidelines now support the use of **SGLT2 inhibitors** and **glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists** in patients with **type 2 diabetes and PAD** to reduce **cardiovascular events**.
6. According to **ACC/AHA guidelines**, patients with **PAD** should receive **high-intensity statin therapy**, or **moderate-intensity statins** if they are **over age 75** or **statin intolerant**.
7. **β₁-selective β-blockers** are safe in **mild to moderate PAD** and do not increase the risk of **symptom exacerbation**.
8. **Blood pressure control** to a target of **<130/80 mm Hg** is associated with reduced cardiovascular events in patients with **PAD**.
9. **Smoking cessation** in patients with **peripheral artery disease (PAD)** is associated with **improved revascularization patency rates** and **less disease progression**.
10. **Foot care** is an essential component of management in patients with **PAD and diabetes mellitus** due to increased risk of **ulceration** and **amputation**.
11. Patients with **type 2 diabetes and PAD** should be monitored closely when prescribed **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors**, due to potential amputation risk noted in some studies.
12. **GLP-1 receptor agonists** and **SGLT2 inhibitors** are recommended in patients with **PAD and type 2 diabetes** because of their ability to **reduce cardiovascular events**, not just glucose levels.
13. **ACE inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** may be preferred antihypertensive agents in patients with **PAD**, based on guideline recommendations.
14. **Nonselective β-blockers** should be avoided in patients with **severe PAD** due to historical associations with **worsened symptoms**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Smoking cessation improves **vascular patency rates** after **revascularization** and enhances **overall survival**.
2. Despite lack of macrovascular benefit, **glucose control** remains important for **microvascular complications**.
4. Monitoring for **amputation risk** is advised when prescribing **SGLT2 inhibitors** in **PAD** patients.
5. Cardiovascular benefit from **GLP-1 receptor agonists** and **SGLT2 inhibitors** occurs **independent of glucose lowering**.
6. This recommendation reflects a graded approach depending on **age and tolerability**.
7. A meta-analysis showed no increased risk from **selective β-blockers** in PAD patients.
8. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may be **preferential agents** in PAD hypertension management.
9. Smoking cessation benefits extend beyond cardiovascular risk reduction to include **limb preservation**.
10. Poor glycemic control in diabetics with PAD contributes to higher rates of **wound infection** and **critical limb ischemia**.
11. Although some trials reported amputation risk, others did not — emphasizing the need for **patient-specific monitoring**.
12. These agents provide **cardiovascular protection independent of HbA1c reduction**.
13. **RAAS inhibition** may offer vascular benefits in PAD beyond blood pressure lowering.
14. While this association is largely historical, **selective β-blockers** have replaced nonselective agents in most contemporary practice.
