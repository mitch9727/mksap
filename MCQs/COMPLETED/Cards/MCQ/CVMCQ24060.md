### 🫠 Vascular Disease: Peripheral Artery Disease Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **ankle-brachial index (ABI)** is the most commonly used diagnostic modality for identifying **lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD)**.
2. **ABI** is calculated as the ratio of **lower extremity to upper extremity systolic blood pressures**.
3. A **resting ABI of 0.90 or less** is **diagnostic for PAD** and correlates with abnormalities seen on arterial imaging.
4. Patients with **claudication** typically have an **ABI between 0.4 and 0.9**, while those with **ischemic rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene** usually have an **ABI less than 0.4**.
5. **ABI testing** is simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and has **sensitivity and specificity approaching 90%** for diagnosing PAD.
6. **ABI values** have prognostic significance; **low ABI** is associated with higher rates of **myocardial infarction, stroke, and death**.
7. **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)** and **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** are used primarily for **planning revascularization** in patients with **critical limb ischemia** or **rest pain**, not for initial PAD diagnosis.
8. **Exercise ABI testing** is used when **resting ABI values are between 0.91 and 1.40** in patients with a high pretest probability of PAD.
9. A **postexercise ankle pressure drop ≥30 mm Hg** or a **>20% decline in ABI** suggests **PAD** on exercise testing.
10. **Toe-brachial index (TBI)** testing is used in patients with **noncompressible arteries** (ABI >1.40), where a **TBI <0.70** indicates PAD.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient has symptoms consistent with claudication and known vascular disease.
3. ABI measurement corresponds well with imaging findings of PAD.
4. Disease severity can be inferred from ABI values, with lower values reflecting more advanced disease.
6. ABI is also used for cardiovascular risk stratification in PAD patients.
7. Revascularization imaging is reserved for severe or urgent cases of limb ischemia.
8. Exercise ABI helps unmask PAD in patients with normal resting ABI but exertional symptoms.
10. Noncompressible arteries due to calcification can falsely elevate ABI, making TBI necessary in such cases.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cigarette smoking** is the most important **modifiable risk factor** for peripheral artery disease (PAD).
2. **Smoking cessation** reduces the risk of **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, **major amputation**, and **disease progression** in PAD.
3. **Diabetes mellitus** is a strong risk factor for PAD, but **intensive glucose control** does not reduce **macrovascular complications** such as MI or stroke.
4. **Foot care** is an essential component of diabetes management in patients with PAD.
5. **Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** and **glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists** are recommended in patients with **type 2 diabetes and PAD** for reduction of **cardiovascular events**.
6. **High-intensity statin therapy** is recommended for patients with PAD per **American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)** guidelines.
7. **Moderate-intensity statins** are appropriate for PAD patients who are **over 75 years old** or **intolerant** of high-intensity statins.
8. A blood pressure target of **<130/80 mm Hg** is recommended in patients with PAD.
9. Patients with PAD and hypertension are treated similarly to those without PAD, though **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** may be preferred.
10. **β₁-selective β-blockers** may be used with caution in patients with **mild to moderate PAD**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Smoking contributes directly to PAD pathogenesis and progression.
2. Smoking cessation also improves outcomes after PAD revascularization.
3. While glucose control helps microvascular complications, it does not impact PAD-related cardiovascular endpoints.
5. Recent data have alleviated concerns about amputation risk with SGLT2 inhibitors, except possibly with canagliflozin.
6. Statin therapy is foundational for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention in PAD.
8. Blood pressure control reduces cardiovascular events, not just PAD-specific outcomes.
10. Earlier concerns about β-blockers worsening PAD symptoms were based on nonselective agents like propranolol.
