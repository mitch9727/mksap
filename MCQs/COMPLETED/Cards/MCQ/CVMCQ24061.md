### 🫀 Atherosclerosis: Asymptomatic Disease Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Management of **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** focuses on **risk factor modification** and disease-specific treatment.
2. Core therapies for ASCVD include **smoking cessation**, **blood pressure control**, **diabetes mellitus management**, **statins**, and **antiplatelet therapy**.
3. **Statin therapy** is indicated in all patients with ASCVD to reduce **low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** to a goal of less than 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).
4. **Antiplatelet therapy** is recommended in most patients with ASCVD.
5. **Nonstatin lipid-lowering agents** (e.g., **bempedoic acid**, **ezetimibe**, **evolocumab**) are reserved for statin-intolerant patients or those not achieving LDL targets with statins alone.
6. **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** should be reserved for **high-risk conditions**, such as recent **coronary stenting** or **minor stroke**, not for asymptomatic ASCVD.
7. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** or **CT angiography** for carotid artery stenosis is indicated only before planned **endarterectomy** or if **ultrasound findings are unclear**.
8. **Stress testing** for coronary artery disease (CAD) is not indicated in **asymptomatic** patients with **cerebrovascular disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient with mild bilateral carotid stenosis, LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dL, and no symptoms is optimally managed with current therapy.
6. Adding clopidogrel for DAPT in this case would increase bleeding risk without benefit.
7. The patient’s carotid duplex ultrasound results are definitive and show only mild disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Silent myocardial ischemia** is defined by reversible abnormalities on testing (e.g., **ST depression**, **myocardial perfusion defects**, or **wall motion abnormalities**) in asymptomatic patients.
2. Patients with **silent myocardial ischemia** and underlying heart disease have a **worse prognosis**.
3. Management of **silent myocardial ischemia** should include **secondary prevention** strategies such as **aspirin** and **statins**, although definitive guidelines are lacking.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Silent ischemia can be detected via exercise ECG, ambulatory monitoring, radionuclide stress testing, or dobutamine echocardiography.
3. Despite lack of formal guidelines, secondary prevention is recommended due to prognostic implications.
