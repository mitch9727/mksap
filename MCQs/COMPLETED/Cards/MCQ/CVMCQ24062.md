### 🫠 Acute Coronary Syndromes: Invasive Management in Older Adults

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Urgent invasive treatment** (within 2 hours) is recommended for patients with **type 1 non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)** who have **hemodynamic instability**, **refractory chest pain**, **heart failure**, or **ventricular arrhythmias**.
2. In patients with **high-risk NSTE-ACS**, the presence of **electrocardiogram (ECG) changes**, **elevated troponin levels**, and **clinical signs of heart failure** supports the need for **immediate cardiac catheterization**.
3. **Intermediate-risk patients** with NSTE-ACS may undergo **delayed cardiac catheterization** within **24 to 72 hours** after presentation if initially stabilized.
4. **Low-risk patients** with NSTE-ACS may be managed with an **ischemia-guided strategy**, including **stress testing** to determine the need for invasive evaluation.
5. In **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**, **intravenous β-blockers** are contraindicated in patients with **hypotension**, **cardiogenic shock**, **pulmonary congestion**, or **atrioventricular block**.
6. **Submaximal exercise stress testing** is contraindicated in patients with **acute NSTE-ACS and clinical heart failure**.
7. **Age alone should not be a disqualifying factor** for pursuing **invasive treatment** strategies in **older adults** with **acute coronary syndrome**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This urgent approach reduces mortality in unstable presentations and is endorsed in guidelines for type 1 NSTE-ACS.
2. These findings classify the patient as very high risk and indicate a benefit from early revascularization.
3. The timing of intervention depends on clinical stability and risk assessment using validated scoring systems.
4. Ischemia-guided strategies are reserved for stable presentations without high-risk features.
5. Oral β-blockers may be introduced later, but IV formulations can worsen hemodynamics in unstable patients.
6. Stress testing during acute ischemia can provoke arrhythmias and worsen ischemia in unstable patients.
7. Older adults are often undertreated due to perceived procedural risk, but outcomes support intervention when otherwise healthy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Patients older than 75 years** are at heightened cardiovascular risk due to a higher **prevalence**, **severity**, and **extent** of **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
2. In **older adults**, comorbidities such as **muscle loss** and **gait abnormalities** may limit the usefulness of **exercise stress testing** for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.
3. **Secondary prevention therapies** for **CAD**—including **antiplatelet agents**, **β-blockers**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**, and **statins**—are often **underused** in **older patients**.
4. **Invasive coronary angiography** and **revascularization** are used **less frequently** in older adults, partly due to perceived risks and a **lack of outcome data** from clinical trials.
5. Despite age-related concerns, **exercise**, **diet**, and other **healthy lifestyle modifications** remain essential components of **cardiovascular risk reduction** in **all age groups**.
6. **Antiplatelet therapy**, **lipid-lowering therapy**, **blood pressure control**, and **glycemic control** are beneficial in **suitably selected older patients** with **coronary artery disease**.
7. **Dyslipidemia** continues to be associated with **adverse cardiovascular outcomes** in older adults and should be **actively treated**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Aging increases both macrovascular and microvascular burden, complicating management.
2. Functional limitations can preclude adequate exercise workload, reducing test utility.
3. Fear of adverse effects, polypharmacy, and ageism contribute to underprescription.
4. Most randomized trial data in CAD are drawn from younger populations.
5. Lifestyle changes provide foundational risk reduction, even in advanced age.
6. These therapies reduce ischemic events and improve quality of life when individualized.
7. Statin therapy has demonstrated outcome benefits in meta-analyses of older patients.
