### 🫠 Cardiology: Cardiovascular Risk Management in Diabetes

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Diabetes mellitus** is associated with a **two- to threefold increased risk** of **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** events, including **cardiovascular mortality**.
2. The increased **ASCVD risk** in diabetes is due to both **traditional cardiovascular risk factors** and **underlying vascular and myocardial dysfunction** related to the diabetic state.
3. **Aggressive treatment** of cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes includes achieving a **blood pressure <130/80 mm Hg** and starting at least **moderate-intensity statin therapy**.
4. Use of **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** and **glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists** may reduce cardiovascular events in patients with **diabetes mellitus**.
5. In **asymptomatic patients with diabetes**, **screening for coronary artery disease** with **exercise stress testing** is **not recommended**, as it has not been shown to improve outcomes.
6. **Aspirin** does not reduce cardiovascular events in **patients with diabetes** who do **not have established ASCVD**, and it should not be used for **primary prevention** in patients aged **>60 years**.
7. **Antianginal medications** such as **metoprolol** should not be used in asymptomatic patients without established ASCVD and with well-controlled blood pressure.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This increased cardiovascular risk persists even in patients with adequate glycemic control and no symptoms.
2. Management includes both lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapies targeting hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia.
4. SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists confer cardiovascular benefit independent of glucose lowering.
6. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against aspirin for primary prevention in adults over 60 years and suggests individualized decision-making for those aged 40–59 with elevated ASCVD risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Diabetes mellitus** is associated with a **two- to threefold increase** in **age-adjusted risk** of **coronary artery disease (CAD)** events, including **cardiovascular mortality**.
2. The elevated risk of **CAD in diabetes** is due to both a higher incidence of **cardiovascular risk factors** and the **vascular and myocardial dysfunction** that accompanies diabetes.
3. In **symptomatic patients with diabetes**, the **diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive stress testing** is similar to that in patients without diabetes.
4. **Non–chest pain symptoms** such as **dyspnea** and **nausea** are more common manifestations of **CAD** in patients with diabetes.
5. Screening for **coronary artery disease** in **asymptomatic patients with diabetes** using **stress testing** has no proven benefit on outcomes and is **not recommended**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This increased risk applies even after adjusting for age, emphasizing the independent contribution of diabetes.
2. Myocardial fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction are components of this pathophysiology.
3. Despite common misconceptions, diabetes does not reduce the performance of stress testing when symptoms are present.
4. Atypical presentations of ischemia warrant a high index of suspicion in diabetic populations.
5. Screening asymptomatic individuals may lead to unnecessary procedures without survival benefit.
