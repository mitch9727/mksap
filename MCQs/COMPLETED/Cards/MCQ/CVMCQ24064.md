### 🫀 Lipid Management: Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia in ASCVD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Icosapent ethyl**, a highly purified fish oil, may be added in patients with **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** or high cardiovascular risk who have **persistently elevated triglyceride levels** despite statin therapy.
2. Patients at high cardiovascular risk include those **aged ≥50 years with diabetes** and **at least one additional ASCVD risk factor**.
3. The **REDUCE-IT trial** demonstrated that **icosapent ethyl** reduced the risk of **cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina** in this population.
4. In REDUCE-IT, **icosapent ethyl** provided a **4.8% absolute risk reduction** in the composite cardiovascular outcome over a **median follow-up of 4.9 years**.
5. **High-intensity statin therapy** is recommended for patients with **diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD)** to achieve a **≥50% LDL cholesterol reduction** and **LDL cholesterol <55 mg/dL (1.42 mmol/L)**.
6. If LDL cholesterol goals are not achieved with statin monotherapy, **ezetimibe** or **proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors** such as **alirocumab** may be added.
7. **Ezetimibe** and **PCSK9 inhibitors** are not used to lower triglycerides.
8. **Insulin** is not appropriate for lowering triglyceride levels in patients with **adequate glycemic control** (e.g., hemoglobin A1c 6.2%) and may increase the risk of **hypoglycemia**.
9. **Niacin** is no longer recommended in the management of hyperlipidemia due to **lack of benefit on long-term cardiovascular outcomes**, **poor tolerability**, and potential to **worsen glycemic control**.
10. The **American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)** guidelines have excluded **niacin** from recommended lipid-lowering therapy.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Icosapent ethyl is appropriate for patients with ASCVD or diabetes and an additional ASCVD risk factor who have triglyceride levels of 135–499 mg/dL (1.53–5.64 mmol/L) despite statin therapy.
3. The REDUCE-IT trial provides direct evidence for the cardiovascular benefit of icosapent ethyl in this setting.
5. LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dL is based on newer ACC/AHA secondary prevention targets for very high-risk individuals.
6. These agents primarily address LDL-C, not triglycerides.
8. This patient’s hemoglobin A1c of 6.2% indicates good glycemic control without insulin therapy.
9. Niacin’s adverse effects include flushing and worsening insulin resistance.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **High-intensity statin therapy** is recommended for all patients with **diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD)**, regardless of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
2. **Ezetimibe** or **PCSK9 inhibitors** should be added if the **LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)** or **<55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L)** in patients with prior acute coronary syndrome is not achieved.
3. **Icosapent ethyl** is a reasonable addition for patients with **controlled LDL-C** but **elevated triglyceride levels (135–499 mg/dL)** on statin therapy.
4. **Combination therapy** with **statin plus fibrate or niacin** is **not recommended**.
5. **Daily aspirin (75–162 mg)** is recommended for **secondary prevention** in patients with **diabetes and CAD**.
6. **Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** and/or **glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists** are recommended in **type 2 diabetes** and **established CAD** to reduce **cardiovascular and renal events**.
7. **Aggressive risk factor reduction**, including **increased physical activity**, **weight loss**, and **glycemic control**, is a foundational component of managing **coronary artery disease (CAD)** in patients with **diabetes**.
8. A **blood pressure target <130/80 mm Hg** is recommended in patients with **diabetes and ASCVD**, provided it can be achieved **without undue treatment burden**.
9. **ACE inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** at the **maximally tolerated dose** are the preferred antihypertensives in **diabetes with ASCVD**, due to their **renal and cardiovascular protective effects**.
10. **β-Blockers** are indicated in patients with **established coronary artery disease**, though additional antihypertensives may be needed for blood pressure control.
11. The **anticoagulant rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily)** may be combined with **aspirin** in patients with **CAD or peripheral artery disease** and **low bleeding risk** to reduce **major adverse cardiovascular and limb events**.
12. The use of **P2Y12 inhibitors** (such as **clopidogrel** or **ticagrelor**) for **secondary prevention** in patients with **diabetes and CAD** is evolving, with potential benefits offset by **increased bleeding risk**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The goal of LDL-C reduction is ≥50% from baseline.
3. Icosapent ethyl is appropriate when triglyceride elevation persists despite statin-based LDL-C control.
4. Lack of outcome benefit and adverse effects limit the use of niacin or fibrates in combination with statins.
6. These agents provide benefit beyond glucose control in patients with diabetes and CAD.
7. Lifestyle interventions complement pharmacologic therapy in diabetes and ASCVD management.
8. This goal aligns with contemporary hypertension guidelines for patients with established cardiovascular disease.
9. ACE inhibitors and ARBs provide dual benefit in protecting both heart and kidneys in high-risk diabetic patients.
10. β-blockers improve mortality in CAD, especially post–myocardial infarction, and may be part of a combination antihypertensive regimen.
11. This dual pathway strategy is based on trials like COMPASS, and is selectively used in patients without high bleeding risk.
12. Dual antiplatelet therapy may be considered short-term post–acute coronary syndrome or stenting but requires individualized decision-making.
