### 🫠 Coronary Artery Disease: Diabetes Treatment with Cardioprotective Agents

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors**, such as **empagliflozin**, and **glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists**, such as **dulaglutide**, reduce **cardiovascular events** in patients with **type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)** and **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** or those at high risk.
2. **SGLT2 inhibitors** and/or **GLP-1 receptor agonists** are recommended for patients with **type 2 diabetes mellitus** and **established coronary artery disease (CAD)** to reduce the risk of **cardiovascular and renal events**.
3. Adding an **SGLT2 inhibitor** such as **empagliflozin** is an appropriate next step in a patient with **type 2 diabetes mellitus**, **established CAD**, and **inadequate glycemic control** (e.g., **hemoglobin A1c >8%**).
4. **Amlodipine** is an appropriate **antihypertensive and antianginal agent**, but is not indicated if **blood pressure** is well controlled and **angina symptoms** are absent.
5. **P2Y12 inhibitors** such as **clopidogrel** are not routinely used for **stable angina** and should be reserved for **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** or **post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**.
6. **Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors**, such as **evolocumab**, are indicated in patients with **ASCVD** to achieve an **LDL cholesterol** target of **<55 mg/dL (1.42 mmol/L)**.
7. Additional **lipid-lowering therapy** is not indicated when **LDL cholesterol** is already below **55 mg/dL (1.42 mmol/L)** in patients with **ASCVD**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in high-risk diabetic populations.
2. These agents are used in conjunction with lifestyle modification and metformin to reduce macrovascular and microvascular complications.
3. This patient had **hemoglobin A1c of 8.4%**, suggesting suboptimal glucose control despite current therapy.
4. Amlodipine would be used if systolic blood pressure exceeded **130 mm Hg** or if **symptomatic angina** were present.
5. The use of clopidogrel in stable CAD increases bleeding risk without proven outcome benefit unless there is a **recent ACS or PCI**.
6. PCSK9 inhibitors are typically added when **statin plus ezetimibe** therapy fails to achieve LDL cholesterol goals.
7. This patient’s **LDL cholesterol level is 52 mg/dL (1.35 mmol/L)**, already below the recommended target for patients with **established ASCVD**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Optimal medical therapy** for patients with **diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD)** includes **risk factor reduction**, **glycemic control**, and **antianginal therapy**.
2. In patients with **diabetes and ASCVD**, the **target blood pressure** is **<130/80 mm Hg** if achievable without excessive treatment burden.
3. **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** at **maximally tolerated dosages** are preferred for **blood pressure control** due to **renal and cardiovascular protective effects**.
4. **β-Blockers** are indicated for patients with **established CAD**, with additional agents added if **blood pressure goals** are unmet or **symptoms persist**.
5. **High-intensity statin therapy** is recommended in patients with **diabetes and CAD**, regardless of baseline **LDL cholesterol** level.
6. **Ezetimibe** or **PCSK9 inhibitors** may be added to **statin therapy** to reduce **LDL cholesterol** by **≥50% from baseline** and achieve a target of **<70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)** or **<55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L)** in patients with prior **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**.
7. **Icosapent ethyl** may reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with **controlled LDL cholesterol** and **elevated triglyceride levels (135–499 mg/dL)** while on statins.
8. **Combination therapy** of **statin plus fibrate or niacin** is **not recommended** for patients with **diabetes and CAD**.
9. **Daily aspirin (75–162 mg)** is recommended for **secondary prevention** in all patients with **diabetes and CAD**.
10. **P2Y12 inhibitors** (e.g., **clopidogrel**, **ticagrelor**) may be used for **secondary prevention**, but increase **bleeding risk**.
11. **Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily**, combined with **aspirin**, may be considered in patients with **CAD or peripheral artery disease (PAD)** and **low bleeding risk** to reduce **major adverse limb and cardiovascular events**.
12. **SGLT2 inhibitors** and/or **GLP-1 receptor agonists** are recommended for patients with **type 2 diabetes mellitus and CAD** to reduce **cardiovascular and renal events**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Components of optimal medical therapy include exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation in addition to pharmacotherapy.
2. Guideline-directed blood pressure targets aim to reduce stroke and cardiovascular risk in high-risk diabetic populations.
3. These agents also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy and reduce heart failure risk.
4. β-Blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand and are used for symptom control and secondary prevention.
5. Even with normal baseline LDL, high-intensity statins reduce events in secondary prevention.
6. More aggressive LDL targets are used post-ACS due to higher residual risk.
7. Icosapent ethyl benefits patients with **high triglycerides** despite statin use, per REDUCE-IT trial.
8. Fibrate and niacin combinations have not improved outcomes and may increase adverse effects.
9. Aspirin use in this setting is well established for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.
10. The bleeding risk must be carefully balanced against potential ischemic benefits.
11. This approach follows the COMPASS trial strategy for dual pathway inhibition.
12. These therapies are now core components of guideline-directed diabetes care with CAD.
