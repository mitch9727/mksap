### 🫠 Cardiomyopathy: Giant Cell Myocarditis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Giant cell myocarditis** is an acute and often fatal form of **myocarditis** that typically occurs in **younger individuals**.
2. **Giant cell myocarditis** often presents with **biventricular heart failure**, **troponin elevation**, **high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block**, and **ventricular arrhythmias**.
3. **Giant cell myocarditis** can cause both **left and right ventricular dysfunction** and is often **rapidly progressive**.
4. Unlike most forms of acute myocarditis, **giant cell myocarditis** may respond to **immunosuppressive therapy**.
5. Diagnosis of **giant cell myocarditis** can be confirmed by **endomyocardial biopsy**, which may be guided by **cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**.
6. Patients with **giant cell myocarditis** often require **percutaneous or surgical ventricular support** and should be transferred to a center capable of providing **mechanical circulatory support** and **cardiac transplantation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This condition is typically seen in patients aged 25 years or younger with sudden-onset severe heart failure symptoms.
2. Clinical features of troponin elevation and conduction disturbances help differentiate it from other cardiomyopathies in young individuals.
3. Rapid deterioration is common, requiring urgent evaluation and treatment in tertiary centers.
4. Immunosuppressive therapy is not typically effective in other forms of myocarditis but is used in giant cell myocarditis.
5. MRI can help localize areas for targeted biopsy, increasing diagnostic yield.
6. Mechanical circulatory support includes options like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), ventricular assist devices (VADs), or transplant evaluation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Giant cell myocarditis** is associated with a high incidence of **high-grade atrioventricular block** and **ventricular arrhythmias**.
2. **Immunosuppressive therapy** should be initiated in **giant cell myocarditis** because it may improve outcomes.
3. Patients with **giant cell myocarditis** may require **mechanical cardiac support**, including **left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** or **heart transplantation**.
4. If **giant cell myocarditis** is suspected, patients should be **urgently transferred** to a hospital with capability for **mechanical circulatory support**.
5. The clinical course of **giant cell myocarditis** can deteriorate rapidly, with progression from **well-appearing to moribund** within **hours**.
6. **Cardiac MRI** may guide **endomyocardial biopsy**, which is required to confirm **giant cell myocarditis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These conduction disturbances are hallmark features and can aid in early recognition.
2. Early initiation of therapy can improve survival, unlike in viral or idiopathic myocarditis.
3. Advanced therapies are often needed due to rapid deterioration and severe biventricular failure.
4. Time-sensitive triage is essential because survival depends on timely support and transplant referral.
5. The fulminant nature of this disease makes rapid escalation of care critical.
6. Biopsy confirmation is required for diagnosis and treatment planning; MRI helps localize areas of active inflammation.
