### 🫠 Heart Failure: Tachycardia-Mediated Cardiomyopathy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy** may be caused by **supraventricular** and **ventricular arrhythmias**, including **premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)**.
2. In patients with frequent **premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)**, **cardiomyopathy** may develop when the burden of PVCs exceeds **10% of all beats** or **more than 10,000 per day**.
3. **Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy** may be reversible with treatment of the underlying rhythm disturbance; both **rate control** (e.g., **β-blockers**) and **rhythm control** (e.g., **catheter ablation**) may be appropriate.
4. **Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring** is used to quantify the burden of **PVCs** and assess for **tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy**.
5. **Endomyocardial biopsy** is not indicated in patients without signs of inflammation or elevated **troponin** levels.
6. **99m-Technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) scintigraphy** is not necessary when **cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** shows no evidence of **cardiac amyloidosis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy** is a potentially reversible cause of **heart failure** and should be suspected in patients with frequent arrhythmias and unexplained **left ventricular (LV) dysfunction**.
2. The 10% threshold corresponds to approximately 10,000 PVCs in a typical day.
3. Improvement in both **LV function** and **symptoms** is often seen with rhythm or rate control strategies.
4. In the clinical vignette, ambulatory ECG was chosen to evaluate frequent PVCs seen on initial ECG.
5. This applies when inflammatory markers such as **PET scan** and **troponin** are normal despite reduced LV function.
6. **Cardiac MRI** had already ruled out amyloidosis, making nuclear imaging redundant.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy** is associated with both **supraventricular** and **ventricular arrhythmias**.
2. **Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy** represents a **reversible cause of heart failure** when **rate** or **rhythm control** improves **left ventricular function**.
3. In patients with **atrial fibrillation** and **rapid ventricular response**, conversion to **sinus rhythm** is more efficacious than **rate control** for improving **systolic function**.
4. Small trials suggest **catheter ablation** may be superior to **medical therapy** in certain populations with **atrial fibrillation and heart failure**.
5. According to the 2023 **ACC/AHA guidelines**, **catheter ablation** is preferred over **rate control therapy** for patients with **atrial fibrillation and heart failure** to improve **symptoms**, **quality of life**, **ejection fraction**, and **clinical outcomes**.
6. In patients with frequent **PVCs**, cardiomyopathy may develop when PVC burden exceeds **10% of beats** or **10,000/day**.
7. **Ambulatory ECG monitoring** is required to determine **PVC frequency** and assess likelihood of **tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy**.
8. **Catheter ablation** should be considered when **PVCs are unifocal** and **tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy** is suspected.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These arrhythmias can lead to **left ventricular dysfunction** when persistent or frequent.
2. This reversibility distinguishes it from structural cardiomyopathies.
3. Rhythm control reduces arrhythmia burden more effectively than rate control in select patients.
4. These findings have informed evolving guidelines on **atrial fibrillation management**.
5. **Catheter ablation** is now a guideline-recommended first-line therapy in appropriately selected patients.
6. These thresholds are used to determine the clinical relevance of PVCs.
7. Holter monitors and other extended ECG modalities are used for PVC quantification.
8. **Unifocal PVCs** are more amenable to targeted ablation strategies.
