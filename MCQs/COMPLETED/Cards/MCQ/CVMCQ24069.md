### 🫀 Cardiology: Cardiac Sarcoidosis Flare Treatment

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **High‑dose glucocorticoids** such as **prednisone** are first‑line therapy for an acute **cardiac sarcoidosis** flare, with the dose slowly tapered according to clinical response.
2. **Cardiac sarcoidosis** commonly presents with **ventricular tachycardia**, **second‑ or third‑degree atrioventricular block**, or **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
3. Diagnosis of **cardiac sarcoidosis** requires typical cardiac manifestations plus demonstration of **noncaseating granuloma** on extracardiac or endomyocardial biopsy.
4. **Positron emission tomography (PET)** and **cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** are valuable for assessing the presence and activity of **cardiac sarcoidosis**.
5. Primary‑prevention **implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD)** placement is indicated in **cardiac sarcoidosis** when **left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35 %**, syncope, scar on imaging, or a requirement for a permanent pacemaker for high‑grade atrioventricular block is present.
6. When arrhythmias are caused by active **cardiac sarcoidosis**, initial treatment with **glucocorticoids** is preferred over antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation.
7. **Amiodarone** can suppress ventricular and atrial arrhythmias in **cardiac sarcoidosis** but is reserved for cases where inflammation has been controlled or steroids are contraindicated.
8. **Catheter ablation** may effectively treat monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in **cardiac sarcoidosis**, but it is typically deferred until inflammatory activity is suppressed.
9. **β‑Blockers** such as **metoprolol** are useful for sarcoidosis‑related cardiomyopathy with HFrEF but are not first‑line therapy for ventricular tachycardia in patients with preserved ejection fraction and active inflammation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Prednisone dosing often starts at 30–60 mg daily and is tapered over several months based on imaging and symptom resolution.
2. These manifestations reflect granulomatous infiltration of the conduction system, myocardium, or ventricular walls.
3. Noncaseating granulomas are the histopathologic hallmark distinguishing sarcoidosis from infectious or other granulomatous diseases.
4. PET identifies metabolically active inflammation, whereas CMR detects fibrosis through late gadolinium enhancement.
5. Scar burden and conduction disease increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, guiding ICD implantation decisions.
6. Treating the underlying inflammation can eliminate the arrhythmic substrate and reduce ventricular tachycardia burden.
7. Long‑term amiodarone therapy carries risks of pulmonary, thyroid, and hepatic toxicity.
8. Ablation success rates improve once the active inflammatory phase has resolved and the arrhythmogenic substrate is stable.
9. In this patient, **left ventricular ejection fraction 50–55 %** makes disease‑specific immunosuppression more appropriate than neurohormonal blockade.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac sarcoidosis** is found at autopsy in up to **25 % of patients with systemic sarcoidosis**.
2. **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging** demonstrating patchy **late gadolinium enhancement** or **18F‑fluorodeoxyglucose PET** showing focal uptake with perfusion defects can establish the diagnosis of **cardiac sarcoidosis** in patients with known systemic sarcoidosis without the need for endomyocardial biopsy.
3. **Endomyocardial biopsy** has low sensitivity for **cardiac sarcoidosis** because myocardial involvement is focal and patchy.
4. Management of **cardiac sarcoidosis with heart failure** combines **guideline‑directed heart failure therapy** with **immunosuppressive medication**.
5. Acute flares of **heart failure (decline in left ventricular ejection fraction)** or arrhythmias due to **cardiac sarcoidosis** are typically treated with **high‑dose prednisone** tapered over **3–6 months**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The true prevalence of cardiac involvement is likely underestimated because of subclinical disease.
2. Imaging criteria allow earlier, less invasive diagnosis and guide immunosuppressive therapy by identifying active inflammation.
3. Sampling error limits biopsy sensitivity; granulomas may be missed unless the affected site is sampled.
4. Standard heart failure drugs include **β‑blockers**, **angiotensin‑converting‑enzyme inhibitors**, and **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**.
5. Tapering regimens vary, but dose reductions are typically made every 4–6 weeks if symptoms and imaging findings improve.
