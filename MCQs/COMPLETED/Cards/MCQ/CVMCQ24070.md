### 🫠 Cardiomyopathy: Atrial Fibrillation Management in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial fibrillation** is common in patients with **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** and should be managed with **rate control** and **anticoagulation**, with early consideration of a **rhythm control strategy**.
2. During **atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response**, **shortened diastolic filling** can worsen **diastolic dysfunction** and exacerbate **left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient**, leading to worsened symptoms in patients with **HCM**.
3. Patients with **HCM** and **atrial fibrillation** should receive **anticoagulation therapy** to prevent **thromboembolic complications**, regardless of their **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score**.
4. The 2020 **American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)** guidelines recommend **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** such as **apixaban** or **rivaroxaban** as first-line therapy for **HCM with atrial fibrillation**, with **vitamin K antagonists** as a second-line option.
5. **Amiodarone** should not be started in a **stable patient** with **atrial fibrillation** and **HCM** who has not yet received **anticoagulant therapy**, due to the risk of **cardioversion-related thromboembolism**.
6. Patients with **HCM** and **atrial fibrillation** often remain **symptomatic despite rate control**, and rhythm control along with anticoagulation should be considered.
7. **Aspirin** is insufficient to prevent **thromboembolic complications** in patients with **HCM and atrial fibrillation** and should not be used as monotherapy.
8. If **rate control** is already achieved with **metoprolol**, additional **atrioventricular nodal blocking agents** such as **diltiazem** are not required.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Rhythm control is often necessary because symptoms may persist even after rate control in HCM.
3. Elevated stroke risk in HCM persists even in the absence of traditional CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk factors.
5. Anticoagulation should precede any attempts at cardioversion to reduce embolic risk.
8. Metoprolol may be uptitrated for further rate control if needed.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Therapeutic lifestyle interventions** in patients with **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** and **overweight or obesity** can reduce the risk of **left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction**, **heart failure**, and **atrial fibrillation**.
2. Patients with **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** should avoid **dehydration**, **excess alcohol**, and **vasodilatory exposures** (e.g., **saunas**, **hot tubs**) to prevent **LVOT obstruction**.
3. **Mild- to moderate-intensity recreational exercise** is generally **safe and beneficial** for patients with **HCM**.
4. In **symptomatic patients** with **HCM**, **nonvasodilating β-blockers** such as **metoprolol** should be titrated to maximum tolerated doses.
5. **Vasodilating β-blockers** such as **carvedilol**, **labetalol**, and **nebivolol** should be **avoided** in patients with **HCM**.
6. **Disopyramide**, a class IA antiarrhythmic with **negative inotropic effects**, can be added for patients with **LVOT obstruction and persistent symptoms** despite β-blockers or **verapamil/diltiazem**.
7. **Digoxin** should be **avoided** in patients with **HCM and atrial fibrillation** because its **positive inotropic effects** may worsen **LVOT obstruction**.
8. All patients with **HCM and atrial fibrillation** should receive **anticoagulation**, regardless of **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score**.
9. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** are considered **first-line** for **HCM with atrial fibrillation**; **warfarin** is second-line.
10. **Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring** should be performed at diagnosis and every **1 to 2 years** in patients with **HCM**, or sooner with **symptoms** such as **palpitations or syncope**.
11. **Repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is recommended with **new cardiac symptoms** or every **1 to 2 years** in **asymptomatic** patients with **HCM**.
12. The **cardiac myosin inhibitor mavacamten** is FDA approved for **symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** and works by **decreasing actin-myosin cross-bridge formation**, thereby **reducing hypercontractility**.
13. **Surgical septal myectomy** is favored over **alcohol septal ablation** in **younger patients with obstructive HCM** or those needing **concomitant cardiac surgery**, due to **higher rates of symptom resolution** and **lower recurrence**.
14. An **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** is recommended in patients with **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** and **systolic dysfunction** for **primary prevention of sudden cardiac death**.
15. An **electrocardiogram (ECG)** should be obtained every **1 to 2 years** in **asymptomatic patients** with **HCM** to monitor for **rhythm or conduction changes**.
16. **Ambulatory ECG monitoring** should be performed at diagnosis and repeated every **1 to 2 years** in **asymptomatic patients**, or sooner if **palpitations or syncope** occur.
17. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** should be repeated in **asymptomatic patients with HCM** every **1 to 2 years**, or sooner with **any change in clinical status or cardiac event**.
18. All patients with **known or suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** should undergo **three-generation family history assessment** and receive **genetic counseling**.

24. **Genotype-positive but phenotype-negative** individuals should undergo **clinical examinations** at standard screening intervals.

27. Results of **genetic testing** in **HCM** are **not routinely used to guide treatment decisions**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Weight loss may reduce mechanical strain and risk of arrhythmia in HCM.
2. These factors reduce preload and can trigger dynamic obstruction in HCM.
3. Exercise supports cardiovascular health without triggering symptoms in most patients.
4. These agents reduce heart rate and contractility without promoting vasodilation.
5. Vasodilation can worsen dynamic obstruction by decreasing preload.
6. Disopyramide has been shown to improve symptoms when used with β-blockers in obstructive HCM.

14. LVEF <50% in HCM is associated with increased mortality risk and justifies ICD placement.
15. Serial ECG helps identify silent conversion to atrial fibrillation or conduction abnormalities.
16. Increased frequency or severity of symptoms prompts early reassessment.
