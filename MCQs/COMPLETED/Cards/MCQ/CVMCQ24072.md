### 🫀 Cardiology: Atrial Myxoma Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Surgical removal** of an **atrial myxoma** is indicated to prevent **embolic events**.
2. **Surveillance with echocardiography** is required after surgical removal of an atrial myxoma to screen for **recurrence**.
3. **Atrial myxoma** is the most common **primary cardiac tumor**, typically arising from the **fossa ovalis** in the **left atrium**.
4. **Atrial myxoma** can present with **constitutional symptoms**, **embolic events**, or symptoms due to **intracardiac obstruction**, such as **dyspnea** or **syncope**.
5. **Mitral valve obstruction** caused by an atrial myxoma may result in auscultatory findings similar to **mitral stenosis** or an **early diastolic sound** called a **tumor plop**.
6. **Biopsy of a left atrial mass** should be avoided because it may cause **tumor embolization**, potentially leading to **stroke** or **tumor metastasis**.
7. **Radiation therapy** is not indicated for suspected atrial myxoma in the absence of a clear extracardiac primary tumor or positive **positron emission tomography (PET)** scan.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Surgical resection is indicated when embolic events are suspected to originate from a cardiac mass.
2. Follow-up imaging is necessary due to risk of myxoma recurrence after resection.
3. Although primary cardiac tumors are rare, two-thirds are benign and nearly 50% of those are myxomas.
4. Myxomas may produce **interleukin**, contributing to systemic symptoms, or fragment, leading to embolism.
5. The “tumor plop” is a positional, early diastolic sound associated with left atrial myxomas obstructing the mitral valve.
6. Percutaneous biopsy poses procedural risks and offers limited diagnostic value in left atrial masses with suspected myxoma.
7. PET-negative, solitary atrial masses in a structurally normal heart are unlikely to be metastatic; radiation is reserved for metastatic disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Most cardiac tumors are metastatic**, with highest metastatic potential seen in **melanoma**, **malignant thymoma**, and **germ cell tumors**.
2. **Carcinomas** of the **lung**, **stomach**, and **colon** carry **intermediate risk** for cardiac metastasis.
3. **Primary cardiac tumors** are **exceedingly rare**, and **two thirds** are **benign**.
4. **Nearly 50%** of primary cardiac tumors are **atrial myxomas**, usually arising in the **left atrium at the fossa ovalis**.
5. **Myxomas** are usually **solitary** and often diagnosed around **age 50**, frequently after a **systemic embolic event**.
6. **Papillary fibroelastomas** are typically located on the **aortic or mitral valves**, and can cause **stroke**, **transient ischemic attack**, or **coronary embolism**.
7. **Angiosarcomas** are the most common **primary malignant cardiac tumor**, typically arising in the **right atrium**, often associated with **pericardial effusion**, **dyspnea**, and **chest pain**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Cardiac metastases often reflect widespread disease; systemic therapy is prioritized.
2. Intermediate-risk tumors may lead to cardiac symptoms if they invade or compress cardiac structures.
3. Despite their rarity, understanding of primary cardiac tumors is essential due to potential for obstruction or embolism.
4. Myxomas classically attach at the fossa ovalis and may present with obstructive or embolic symptoms.
5. Embolism is a common presenting symptom prompting cardiac imaging and diagnosis of myxoma.
6. On echocardiography, papillary fibroelastomas have a frond-like appearance and may be mobile.
7. Angiosarcomas are highly vascular and carry a poor prognosis even with complete surgical resection.
