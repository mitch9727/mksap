### 🫠 Cardiomyopathy: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Screening

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** is an **autosomal dominant** heritable disorder caused by variants in genes encoding **sarcomeric proteins**.
2. **First-degree relatives** of individuals with **HCM** should be screened using **physical examination**, **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, and **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**.
3. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is used in **HCM screening** to evaluate **left ventricular (LV) wall thickness**, **elongation of the anterior mitral valve leaflet**, **papillary muscle anatomy**, **LV crypts**, and **hyperdynamic LV function**.
4. The diagnosis of **HCM** is made when **end-diastolic LV wall thickness** is **≥15 mm** in any segment **without another cause of hypertrophy**.
5. In **first-degree relatives** of a person with known **HCM**, or individuals with a **pathogenic variant in an HCM gene**, the diagnostic threshold for LV wall thickness is reduced to **≥13 mm**.
6. After initial screening for **HCM**, **ECG and TTE** should be repeated **every 1 to 2 years** in children and adolescents and **every 3 to 5 years** in adults or sooner if clinical status changes.
7. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is not a first-line screening test for **HCM**, but it may be used when **echocardiographic visualization** is inadequate.
8. **Late gadolinium enhancement** on CMR imaging can assess **myocardial fibrosis** in **HCM**, which is associated with an increased risk of **ventricular arrhythmias**.
9. **Genetic testing** for **HCM** family members is useful only if a **pathogenic variant** has first been identified in the **index case**.
10. **Genetic testing** of an unaffected family member is uninformative when the **family’s pathogenic variant** for **HCM** is unknown.
11. A **normal ECG and physical examination** do not exclude the possibility of **HCM** in a first-degree relative, and **TTE** is required to assess **LV wall thickness**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Sarcomeric protein gene mutations are the most common cause of familial HCM.
2. Screening aims to identify both phenotypic and preclinical disease.
4. This threshold applies to sporadic or unexplained hypertrophy cases.
5. The lower threshold reflects higher pre-test probability in known familial HCM.
7. CMR is especially useful for delineating hypertrophy or fibrosis not well visualized on TTE.
9. Testing unaffected relatives without a known familial variant can lead to inconclusive or uninformative results.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients with known or suspected **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** should receive **genetic counseling** and undergo **three-generation family history** assessment.
2. **Genetic testing** should be offered to individuals who meet the clinical definition of **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.
3. A **pathogenic genetic variant** can be identified in up to **60% of patients with a family history** of **HCM** and in **20%–30%** of **sporadic cases**.
4. **First-degree relatives** of patients with **HCM** should undergo screening with **electrocardiogram (ECG)** and **echocardiography**.
5. In first-degree relatives of patients with **HCM** who are **children or adolescents**, **ECG and echocardiography** should be repeated every **1 to 2 years**; in **adults**, testing should be repeated every **3 to 5 years** or sooner with a **change in clinical status**.
6. **Genetic testing** should be offered to **first-degree relatives** only if a **pathogenic variant** has been identified in the **index case** of **HCM**.
7. Individuals who are **genotype-positive but phenotype-negative** for **HCM** should undergo **clinical examinations** at the same intervals as standard family screening.
8. A **negative genetic test** in a patient with **HCM** does **not exclude familial disease**, and first-degree relatives should still undergo **clinical screening**.
9. **Genotype-negative relatives** in families with a **known pathogenic variant** identified in the **index HCM patient** do **not require ongoing clinical screening**.
10. Results of **genetic testing** are **not used to guide treatment decisions** in patients with **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This comprehensive assessment identifies familial disease and informs testing decisions.
2. Clinical criteria include unexplained LV hypertrophy and characteristic echocardiographic features.
3. Higher diagnostic yield is seen in familial versus isolated cases.
6. Without a known variant in the proband, testing relatives may be uninformative.
8. Clinical diagnosis of HCM can occur without a detectable sarcomeric variant.
9. Genotype-negative status reliably excludes the need for repeated imaging in known variant families.
10. Management decisions are based on phenotypic findings, not genetic test results.
