### 🫀 Cardiology: Papillary Fibroelastoma Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Papillary fibroelastoma** is the **third most common benign cardiac tumor**, following **cardiac myxoma** and **cardiac lipoma**.  
2. **Papillary fibroelastomas** arise **predominantly from cardiac valves**, most frequently the **aortic** and **mitral valves**.  
3. The **papillary frond‑like architecture** of a **fibroelastoma** predisposes to **embolization** of tumor fragments or attached thrombus into the **coronary, systemic, or cerebral arterial circulation**.  
4. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** typically shows a **heterogeneous globular mass** or a **mobile frond‑like lesion** attached to the **valvular surface** in papillary fibroelastoma.  
5. **Surgical resection** is the **recommended treatment** for patients with **papillary fibroelastoma** who have experienced **embolic symptoms** such as **transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke**.  
6. Asymptomatic **papillary fibroelastomas ≥1 cm** in size are generally **treated surgically** because of their high embolic potential.  
7. For **asymptomatic papillary fibroelastomas <1 cm** arising from **right‑sided heart valves**, **clinical and imaging surveillance** may be considered instead of immediate surgery.  
8. There are **no randomized trials** comparing **surgery** versus **antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy** for the prevention of embolic events in **incidentally discovered papillary fibroelastoma**.  
9. **Antibiotic therapy** is **not indicated** for a **papillary fibroelastoma** in the **absence of infective endocarditis**.  
10. **Long‑term anticoagulation with warfarin** is **not an accepted substitute** for **surgical excision** of an **embolizing papillary fibroelastoma**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Cardiac tumors are rare overall, and **fibroelastomas** account for approximately **8%–10%** of benign primary cardiac tumors.  
2. Left‑sided valve location and a highly mobile morphology increase the likelihood of **neurologic** or **coronary embolization**.  
3. High‑resolution **TEE** is more sensitive than **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** for detecting small valvular masses.  
4. **Surgical excision** of a solitary fibroelastoma is usually curative and carries a **low operative risk**.  
5. Smaller, right‑sided fibroelastomas pose **minimal systemic embolic risk** because any emboli enter the **pulmonary circulation**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Most cardiac tumors** are **metastatic** rather than primary.  
2. **Melanoma**, **malignant thymoma**, and **germ cell tumors** have the **highest propensity** to **metastasize to the heart**.  
3. **Carcinomas of the lung, stomach, and colon** carry an **intermediate risk** for **cardiac metastasis**.  
4. Management of **metastatic cardiac tumors** focuses on **systemic therapy** of the **primary malignancy**, with **cardiac surgery** reserved for **obstructive cardiac symptoms**.  
5. **Two‑thirds of primary cardiac tumors are benign**, and **approximately 50%** of these are **atrial myxomas**.  
6. **Atrial myxomas** most often attach to the **fossa ovalis** of the **left atrial septum**.  
7. **Atrial myxomas** are usually **solitary** and are typically identified at a **mean age of about 50 years**, frequently **after a systemic embolic event**.  
8. Clinical manifestations of **atrial myxoma** include **constitutional symptoms** driven by **interleukin secretion**, **embolization of tumor fragments**, and **intracardiac obstruction–related symptoms** such as **dyspnea** or **syncope**.  
9. When **mitral valve obstruction** by an **atrial myxoma** is present, auscultation may reveal an **early diastolic “tumor plop”** and findings that **mimic mitral stenosis** but **vary with body position**.  
10. **Surgical excision** of an **atrial myxoma** is indicated to **prevent embolic events**, and **surveillance echocardiography** is recommended to detect **tumor recurrence**.  
11. **Papillary fibroelastomas** are usually **asymptomatic**, but they can lead to **stroke**, **transient ischemic attack**, or **coronary embolization**.  
12. **Angiosarcoma** is the **most common primary malignant cardiac tumor**, typically arising in the **right atrium** and often associated with a **pericardial effusion**.  
13. **Dyspnea** and **chest pain** are common presenting symptoms of **cardiac angiosarcoma**.  
14. **Contrast‑enhanced computed tomography (CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** helps **distinguish a right atrial angiosarcoma** from a **right atrial myxoma** because **angiosarcomas are highly vascular**.  
15. Prognosis of **cardiac angiosarcoma** is **poor**, with **median survival of 6–12 months** and **survival <2 years** even after **complete surgical resection**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. High melanin content and aggressive hematogenous spread explain melanoma’s predilection for cardiac metastasis.  
4. Obstructive symptoms include superior vena cava syndrome, heart failure, or arrhythmias due to intracardiac mass effect.  
7. Systemic emboli from myxoma commonly affect the brain, kidneys, or extremities.  
11. The majority of fibroelastomas are discovered incidentally on echocardiography performed for other reasons.  
14. On CMR, angiosarcomas show heterogeneous signal intensity and avid contrast enhancement reflective of tumor vascularity.
