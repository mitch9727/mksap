### 🫀 Cardiomyopathy: Provokable Obstruction in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the first-line test in diagnosing **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.
2. TTE demonstrates the degree and location of **left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy**, which is defined as **≥15 mm in any LV region** or **≥13 mm in a person with a first-degree relative with HCM or genotype-positive status**.
3. TTE can quantify the **left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient**, which differentiates **obstructive** from **nonobstructive HCM**.
4. In patients with a **resting LVOT gradient <50 mm Hg**, obstruction should be provoked using the **Valsalva maneuver** or **exercise**.
5. **Stress echocardiography** is indicated in patients with exertional symptoms and a resting LVOT gradient <50 mm Hg to determine whether obstruction is provokable.
6. **Cardiac catheterization** may be used in HCM to measure gradients, assess for **coronary artery disease (CAD)** or **myocardial bridging**, and evaluate **septal perforating arteries** if **alcohol septal ablation** is considered.
7. **Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET)** imaging cannot be used to measure intracardiac pressure gradients.
8. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** may be used in HCM to clarify anatomy when **TTE is suboptimal** or to plan **septal reduction therapy** in patients with **refractory symptomatic LVOT obstruction**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. TTE is both diagnostic and useful for physiologic assessment in HCM.
2. These hypertrophy thresholds guide diagnosis and genetic screening decisions.
3. Differentiating obstructive from nonobstructive HCM guides symptom-directed therapy.
4. Provoking obstruction helps identify symptomatic patients who would benefit from therapy such as β-blockers.
5. The patient in the vignette had symptoms suggestive of obstruction but a resting gradient <30 mm Hg.
6. Cardiac catheterization is reserved for additional structural or procedural evaluation, not initial assessment of obstruction.
7. Cardiac PET is useful for ischemia evaluation but not hemodynamic measurements.
8. TEE is typically used in procedural planning or when transthoracic imaging is limited.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)** reveals abnormal findings in **75% to 95%** of patients with **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.
2. Common ECG abnormalities in HCM include **increased QRS voltage**, **left atrial enlargement**, **left ventricular conduction abnormalities**, **pathologic Q waves**, and **significant repolarization abnormalities**.
3. **Doppler echocardiography** is the modality of choice for **quantifying the LVOT gradient** in HCM.
4. In patients with HCM and **resting LVOT gradient <50 mm Hg**, **echocardiography with provocative maneuvers** such as **Valsalva or exercise** is recommended to establish obstruction.
5. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** imaging is indicated to clarify the diagnosis of HCM when **echocardiographic findings are inconclusive**.
6. Initial evaluation of HCM should include **24- to 48-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring** to detect **arrhythmias**.
7. The presence of **nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)** on ambulatory monitoring indicates a **higher risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD)**.
8. **Exercise stress testing** is reasonable in HCM to assess **functional status** and provide **prognostic information**.
9. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** imaging with **gadolinium contrast** may help differentiate HCM from **hypertensive heart disease** and **athlete’s heart**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Most patients with HCM will have some ECG abnormalities on screening.
2. These findings reflect electrical and structural remodeling in HCM.
3. Doppler measurement allows dynamic assessment of flow gradient across the LVOT.
4. Provocation testing improves detection of latent dynamic obstruction.
5. CMR is a complementary tool when echocardiography is nondiagnostic.
6. Ambulatory monitoring is essential for arrhythmic risk stratification in HCM.
7. NSVT is a known predictor for sudden cardiac events in HCM.
8. Exercise capacity can help guide both prognosis and lifestyle recommendations.
9. Gadolinium-enhanced CMR can detect patterns of fibrosis and wall thickness distribution useful for distinguishing HCM from other conditions.
