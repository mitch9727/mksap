### 🫠 Cardiomyopathy: Familial Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** presents with **dyspnea**, **peripheral edema**, **exercise intolerance**, and can lead to **congestive hepatopathy with ascites** and **atrial arrhythmias**.
2. **Echocardiographic findings** in **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** include **biatrial enlargement** and **severe diastolic dysfunction** with **normal ventricular size**, **wall thickness**, and **systolic function**.
3. **Genetic testing** is indicated in patients with a **family history of cardiomyopathy at an early age** and a **cardiac phenotype consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)**.
4. **Pathogenic variants** in genes that cause **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** often overlap with those implicated in **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** and **dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)**.
5. **Endomyocardial biopsy** is useful for excluding **infiltrative diseases** such as **amyloidosis** or **sarcoidosis** in the evaluation of **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)**.
6. **99m-Technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy** is not indicated in **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** when **left ventricular wall thickness is normal** and there is **evidence of congestive hepatopathy**.
7. **Liver biopsy** is not indicated in patients with **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** when ascites is due to **congestive hepatopathy** and **primary liver disease is unlikely**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient's symptoms and findings—including ascites, family history of early-onset cardiomyopathy, and echocardiographic abnormalities—are consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy.
3. Identification of a pathogenic variant in the proband enables cascade testing and risk stratification for family members.
5. In this young patient with a strong family history, genetic testing is preferred over biopsy for establishing the diagnosis.
6. Scintigraphy helps differentiate cardiac amyloidosis types but is not appropriate when amyloidosis is unlikely based on imaging and clinical features.
7. Ascitic fluid analysis showed findings consistent with a cardiac etiology (high serum albumin-ascites gradient and elevated protein), supporting restrictive cardiomyopathy as the cause.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** is a rare disorder defined by **abnormally stiff, noncompliant ventricles**, often due to **sarcomeric gene mutations** and **desmin abnormalities**.
2. **Sarcomeric genetic variants** causing **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** are similar to those that cause **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.
3. **Histologic features** of **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** include **interstitial fibrosis** and **myocyte disarray**, also seen in **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.
4. **Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** often presents with **pulmonary hypertension**, **tricuspid regurgitation**, and **mitral regurgitation**.
5. Differentiating **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** from other **restrictive physiology** causes requires a **multimodal diagnostic approach**, including **echocardiography**, **cardiac magnetic resonance imaging**, and possibly **endomyocardial biopsy**.
6. **Constrictive pericarditis** and **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)** share similar clinical and echocardiographic findings but require different management approaches.
7. **Kussmaul sign**, a rise in jugular venous pressure on inspiration, is more commonly associated with **constrictive pericarditis** than with **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)**.
8. **Ventricular interdependence** is a hallmark of **constrictive pericarditis** but is not seen in **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)**.
9. A **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** level ≥400 pg/mL is more typical of **restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)**, whereas a level <100 pg/mL suggests **constrictive pericarditis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Abnormal ventricular compliance results in impaired diastolic filling, a key hemodynamic feature of RCM.
2. This genetic overlap explains the phenotypic continuum between RCM and HCM.
3. These pathologic findings support the classification of RCM as a sarcomeric disease.
5. Diseases with restrictive physiology but differing ventricular wall thickness (e.g., amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, radiation fibrosis) should be considered.
6. Surgical pericardiectomy can be curative in constrictive pericarditis, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis.
8. Ventricular interdependence limits biventricular filling and is demonstrable via hemodynamic testing.
9. BNP levels assist in distinguishing constrictive from restrictive physiology due to differences in myocardial stretch.
