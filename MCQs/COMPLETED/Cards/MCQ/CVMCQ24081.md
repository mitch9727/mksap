### 🫀 Pericardial Disease: Cardiac Tamponade Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac tamponade** with hemodynamic compromise requires **immediate pericardial drainage**.
2. **Pericardiocentesis** is the preferred initial method for pericardial drainage and can be performed via a **subxiphoid approach** guided by **echocardiography** or **fluoroscopy**.
3. Clinical signs of **cardiac tamponade** include **tachycardia**, **pulsus paradoxus**, **elevated central venous pressure** with **absent y descent** of the jugular venous pulse, and **muffled heart sounds**.
4. **Systolic blood pressure** may be normal early in tamponade due to the **adrenergic response**, but eventually declines as **intrapericardial pressure increases**.
5. **Echocardiography** is the best initial test for tamponade and may reveal **early diastolic right ventricular collapse**, **late diastolic right atrial collapse**, and **abnormal interventricular septal motion**.
6. **Emergent pericardial window surgery** is indicated if **pericardiocentesis is not feasible** or if **fluid reaccumulates** after initial drainage.
7. **Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)** or **andexanet alfa** may reverse anticoagulation but do **not replace the need for emergent pericardial drainage** in tamponade.
8. In the setting of tamponade, **device extraction** is not the immediate priority, even if the tamponade is presumed due to **pacemaker lead perforation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The indication for immediate drainage is based on clinical evidence of shock in the presence of tamponade physiology.
2. This approach is commonly used in emergent settings and is effective when guided imaging is available.
3. These findings reflect impaired diastolic filling and accumulation of pericardial fluid.
4. The adrenergic compensation may maintain perfusion pressure temporarily despite compromised stroke volume.
5. These echocardiographic findings are considered diagnostic features of cardiac tamponade.
6. A surgical window may also allow for tissue sampling or prevention of recurrence.
7. Reversal agents are used adjunctively when anticoagulation contributes to bleeding, but cannot delay life-saving intervention.
8. Definitive correction of lead perforation is secondary to resolving the hemodynamic instability caused by tamponade.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac tamponade** is life-threatening and requires **urgent pericardial drainage** after diagnostic confirmation.
2. **Pericardiocentesis** is often performed with **echocardiographic** or **fluoroscopic guidance**.
3. **Surgical pericardial drainage** is indicated if **pericardiocentesis is not feasible**, to obtain **pericardial tissue** for diagnostic purposes, or to **prevent recurrence** via **pericardial window**.
4. In **hemodynamically unstable patients**, **intravenous normal saline** may be used as a **temporizing measure** or **bridge to definitive therapy**.
5. After drainage, **effusive-constrictive pericarditis** may be revealed, which may warrant **medical therapy** if an **inflammatory process** is present.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Prompt intervention is critical to avoid circulatory collapse.
2. Image guidance improves safety and accuracy of fluid removal.
3. Malignant effusions and persistent recurrences often require surgical intervention.
4. Volume expansion helps maintain preload temporarily until drainage can be achieved.
5. CMR imaging may assist in differentiating inflammation vs fibrosis; surgery is reserved for refractory cases.
