### 🫠 Cardiology: Tuberculous Pericarditis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **More than 60% of pericardial effusions** are caused by **tuberculosis** in countries where **tuberculosis is endemic**.
2. **Tuberculous pericarditis** should be considered in patients with **risk factors**, including **prior residence in a high-prevalence area**.
3. **Pericardiocentesis** should be performed in suspected **tuberculous pericardial effusion** to establish the diagnosis.
4. Pericardial fluid from pericardiocentesis should be sent for **acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and culture**, **nucleic acid amplification tests**, and **adenosine deaminase levels**.
5. **Pericardial drainage** is indicated in suspected tuberculous pericarditis due to the risk of **cardiac tamponade** and **constrictive pericarditis**.
6. **Pericardiocentesis** is the initial step in managing **large, presumed inflammatory pericardial effusions**.
7. **Open pericardiectomy** or creation of a **pericardial window** is considered if pericardiocentesis is **unsuccessful**, **unsafe**, or if the effusion is **recurrent**.
8. **Right heart catheterization** is **not indicated** for evaluating pericardial effusion; **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is typically adequate.
9. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is generally **not required** unless **TTE is inadequate**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of pericardial effusion in endemic regions and should be prioritized in differential diagnosis when risk factors exist.
3. Establishing the etiology via pericardial fluid analysis helps guide antitubercular therapy and prevent complications.
5. Tuberculous pericarditis commonly progresses to tamponade or constriction if untreated, warranting early drainage.
6. Pericardiocentesis serves both diagnostic and therapeutic roles in large inflammatory effusions.
7. Malignancy is a frequent cause of recurrent effusions requiring surgical management.
8. Hemodynamics and tamponade physiology are usually well assessed noninvasively by TTE.
9. TEE is reserved for technically limited transthoracic studies.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pericardial effusions** are often **asymptomatic** and discovered incidentally on **chest radiograph**, **computed tomography (CT)**, or **echocardiogram**.
2. In **asymptomatic patients**, most **pericardial effusions** are **idiopathic**, but other causes include **malignancy**, **infection**, **autoimmune disease**, **hypothyroidism**, and **iatrogenic factors** (e.g., **medications**, **anticoagulation therapy**).
3. In countries where **tuberculosis is endemic**, **more than 60%** of pericardial effusions are caused by **tuberculosis**.
4. **Pericardiocentesis** should be considered for both **diagnostic and therapeutic purposes** if **cancer**, **tuberculosis**, or **bacterial infection** is strongly suspected.
5. In pericardial effusions of **unknown cause** with **elevated inflammatory markers**, **empiric treatment for pericarditis** may be reasonable.
6. **Drainage** should be considered for **large idiopathic effusions** of **more than 3 months' duration**, given the risk of **progression to cardiac tamponade**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Incidental findings often prompt evaluation in otherwise asymptomatic individuals.
2. These alternative causes should be systematically assessed based on history and testing.
4. Diagnostic pericardiocentesis clarifies etiology and can be life-saving in infectious or malignant effusions.
6. Chronic effusions carry a one-in-three risk of tamponade, prompting intervention despite a lack of symptoms.
