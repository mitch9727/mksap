### 🫠 Pericardial Disease: Asymptomatic Idiopathic Pericardial Effusion Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Many **pericardial effusions** are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on **chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**.
2. In asymptomatic patients, most pericardial effusions are **idiopathic**, but potential causes such as **malignancy, infection (including tuberculosis), autoimmune disease, hypothyroidism, and iatrogenic factors (for example, anticoagulation therapy)** must be considered.
3. In countries where **tuberculosis** is endemic, **more than 60%** of pericardial effusions are attributable to **tuberculosis**.
4. Asymptomatic patients with a **small to moderate-sized idiopathic pericardial effusion** and **no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade** should undergo **surveillance with repeat TTE in 6–12 months** rather than immediate intervention.
5. **Pericardiocentesis** is recommended only when **malignancy or bacterial infection is strongly suspected** or when **pericardial tamponade** is present; it is **not routine** for stable, idiopathic small to moderate effusions.
6. **Pericardial window surgery** is **not indicated** for management of a small to moderate-sized asymptomatic idiopathic pericardial effusion.
7. **Right heart catheterization** is reserved for situations in which **cardiac tamponade** is suspected but cannot be confirmed non‑invasively and is **unnecessary** in uncomplicated asymptomatic effusions.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Incidental effusions are frequently detected during imaging performed for pulmonary or oncologic indications.
2. A targeted evaluation typically includes history, physical examination, basic laboratory studies (including thyroid function), and cancer or infectious work‑up guided by risk factors.
3. The high prevalence of tuberculous effusion in endemic areas necessitates focused diagnostic testing for **Mycobacterium tuberculosis**.
4. Enlargement or development of symptoms between imaging studies should prompt earlier reassessment and possible intervention.
5. Diagnostic pericardiocentesis allows fluid cytology and cultures, while therapeutic drainage relieves hemodynamic compromise in tamponade.
6. Surgical pericardial window creation is generally reserved for recurrent, large, or loculated effusions that do not respond to percutaneous drainage.
7. Hemodynamic assessment with catheterization shows equalization of diastolic pressures in tamponade but adds no value when tamponade is not suspected.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with a **pericardial effusion of unknown cause accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers**, empiric treatment for **acute pericarditis** may be considered reasonable.
2. **Large idiopathic pericardial effusions** that persist for **longer than three months** should be evaluated for **drainage**, because approximately **one in three** will progress to **cardiac tamponade**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Empiric therapy typically includes **non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** and **colchicine**, aiming to suppress inflammation while further diagnostic studies are pursued.
2. Early drainage of persistent large effusions can prevent hemodynamic compromise and allows fluid analysis to exclude occult malignancy or infection.
