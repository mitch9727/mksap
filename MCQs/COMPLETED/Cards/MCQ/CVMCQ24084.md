### 🫠 Heart Failure: Evaluation of Dyspnea in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Device

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Common complications after **left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** placement include **heart failure**, **gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding**, **driveline infections**, **arrhythmias**, **stroke**, and **hemolysis**.
2. **Gastrointestinal bleeding** after **LVAD placement** is often associated with **arteriovenous malformations** in the **small bowel**.
3. Mechanisms contributing to **LVAD-associated GI bleeding** include **reduced pulsatility**, **anticoagulation**, **impaired von Willebrand factor and platelet function**, and **endothelial dysfunction**.
4. Patients with **LVAD-associated GI bleeding** may present with **overt bleeding**, **fatigue**, or **exertional dyspnea**.
5. In patients with an LVAD and **no evidence of fluid overload**, **hemoglobin testing** is the most appropriate test to evaluate **exertional dyspnea**.
6. **Valsartan-sacubitril** interferes with **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** interpretation due to **neprilysin inhibition**; instead, **N-terminal pro–BNP** should be used.
7. **Echocardiography** may help assess **pump function** and **pump thrombosis**, especially if **hemolysis** or **decreased pump function** is suspected.
8. Tests for **hemolysis** (e.g., **lactate dehydrogenase**, **haptoglobin**, **plasma free hemoglobin**) should be performed **only after anemia has been confirmed**.
9. The incidence of **pump-associated hemolysis** is low with **newer LVAD designs**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. The patient described had exertional dyspnea without signs of fluid overload (e.g., no jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, or weight change), making anemia evaluation more appropriate than imaging or natriuretic peptide testing.
6. Neprilysin inhibitors reduce breakdown of BNP but do not affect N-terminal pro–BNP levels, making the latter a preferred diagnostic tool in such patients.
7. Echocardiography may be second-line after anemia workup if initial labs are unrevealing.
8. Hemolysis is not the first suspected cause without documented anemia and is less likely due to advanced device technology.
