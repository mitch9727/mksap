### 🫠 Heart Failure: SGLT2 Inhibitors in Stable HFrEF

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** such as **dapagliflozin** and **empagliflozin** reduce cardiovascular mortality and heart‑failure–related hospitalizations in patients with **heart failure**, irrespective of left‑ventricular ejection fraction or diabetes status.  
2. **Dapagliflozin** and **empagliflozin** are guideline‑directed standard therapy for all patients with **symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.  
3. SGLT2 inhibitors are **contraindicated** in patients with **type 1 diabetes mellitus** or a history of **diabetic ketoacidosis**.  
4. **Dapagliflozin** should not be initiated when the **estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is <30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, and **empagliflozin** should not be initiated when **eGFR is <20 mL/min/1.73 m²**.  
5. Clinicians should use SGLT2 inhibitors cautiously in patients with **frequent urinary tract infections** or a **history of diabetic foot ulcers**.  
6. Initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor may cause **osmotic diuresis**; therefore, clinicians should monitor **volume status**, reassess **laboratory studies**, and consider reducing **loop‑diuretic dosage** after starting therapy.  
7. **Ivabradine**, a sinoatrial‑node inhibitor, is indicated in symptomatic HFrEF only when the **resting heart rate remains >70 beats/min** despite maximally tolerated **β‑blocker** therapy and is unnecessary when heart rate is **68 beats/min**.  
8. **Valsartan–sacubitril** (an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor) provides greater mortality benefit than **angiotensin‑converting‑enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** in symptomatic HFrEF but is often limited by **hypotension** and is inappropriate in patients already hypotensive on an ARB.  
9. **Metoprolol succinate**, **carvedilol**, and **bisoprolol** are the only **β‑blockers** proven to reduce mortality in HFrEF, and no clinical‑trial evidence shows superiority of one of these agents over another.  
10. Although **carvedilol** possesses additional **α‑adrenergic blockade** and may theoretically cause more hypotension than **metoprolol succinate**, this difference has **not been proven** in clinical trials.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Benefits were demonstrated in large randomized trials such as **DAPA‑HF** and **EMPEROR‑Reduced/Preserved**.  
2. SGLT2 inhibitors join **ACE inhibitor/ARB/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor**, **β‑blocker**, and **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** as the four foundational drug classes for HFrEF.  
3. Euglycemic ketoacidosis is the principal concern driving this contraindication.  
4. These renal thresholds reflect U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling and major clinical‑trial inclusion criteria.  
5. Mycotic genital infections and skin ulcerations have been reported more frequently with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.  
6. Early follow‑up laboratory testing typically includes **serum creatinine**, **blood urea nitrogen**, and **electrolytes** within 1–2 weeks of initiation.  
7. Ivabradine primarily reduces heart‑failure hospitalization when added to maximally up‑titrated β‑blocker therapy.  
8. In the **PARADIGM‑HF** trial, patients with **systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg** were excluded, highlighting intolerance in hypotensive individuals.  
9. Target doses for these β‑blockers are **carvedilol 25 mg twice daily (50 mg twice daily if >85 kg)**, **metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily**, and **bisoprolol 10 mg daily**.  
10. Comparative studies have not shown clinically meaningful differences in blood‑pressure effects between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The mortality and hospitalization benefits of **sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors** in heart failure appear to be **independent of osmotic diuresis**, suggesting additional cardioprotective mechanisms.  
2. The **dual sodium–glucose cotransporter 1 and 2 (SGLT1/2) inhibitor sotagliflozin** is **approved for the treatment of heart failure**.  
3. No randomized trials have yet compared **dual SGLT1/2 inhibition** (for example, **sotagliflozin**) with **selective SGLT2 inhibition**; therefore, using either drug class is **considered reasonable in heart‑failure management**.
4. The biguanide **metformin** provides a **survival benefit** in patients with **heart failure (HF)** but should be **discontinued** if **lactic acidosis** develops or the patient enters **cardiogenic shock**.
5. **Sulfonylurea** agents (glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride) have **no randomized controlled-trial data** evaluating outcomes in patients with **heart failure**.
6. The thiazolidinedione **pioglitazone** is **not recommended** for heart-failure patients because it is associated with an **increased risk of HF exacerbation or worsening**.
7. Observational studies suggest that **insulin therapy** may be linked to an **increased incidence or progression** of heart failure.
8. **Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists** (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide) **reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)** but show **no clear benefit—or harm—on heart-failure outcomes**; their use should be **cautious after a recent HF hospitalization**.
9. **Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors** (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin) have **no proven cardiovascular benefit** in patients with heart failure.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Proposed mechanisms include improved myocardial energetics, modulation of inflammatory signaling, and favorable hemodynamic effects beyond natriuresis.  
2. **Sotagliflozin** blocks **intestinal SGLT1** and **renal SGLT2**, leading to both reduced glucose absorption and enhanced glucosuria.  
3. Outcome trials such as **SCORED** and **SOLOIST‑WHF** compared sotagliflozin with placebo, not with other SGLT2 inhibitors, limiting direct efficacy comparisons.
4. Metformin’s benefit is largely derived from retrospective and cohort data; severe renal impairment is an additional trigger for discontinuation.
5. Available evidence is limited to observational registries; neutral or modestly adverse signals have not been confirmed in trials.
6. Fluid retention and weight gain are central mechanisms behind TZD-related HF worsening.
7. Potential mechanisms include sodium retention and adverse effects on cardiac substrate utilization.
8. The caution comes from two small post-hospitalization trials in which neutral to slightly adverse HF signals were observed.
9. Cardiovascular-outcome trials for DPP-4 inhibitors were powered for MACE but did not demonstrate benefit in HF sub-analyses.

    Treatment recommendations for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are displayed. Green indicates a class 1 (strong), yellow a class 2a (moderate), and orange a class 2b (weak) recommendation. Step 1 medications may be started simultaneously at initial (low) doses recommended for HFrEF. Alternatively, these medications may be started sequentially, with sequence guided by clinical or other factors, without the need to achieve target dosing before initiating the next medication. Medication doses should be increased to target as tolerated. Although current guidelines support the use of isosorbide dinitrate–hydralazine in Black patients, making management decisions on the basis of skin color is likely a flawed approach. Questions regarding the underlying studies and the appropriateness of using race to direct management are driving a reevaluation of these recommendations.<br>
