### 🫠 Heart Failure: Cardiogenic Shock Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiogenic shock** is characterized by signs and symptoms of **low cardiac output with hypotension** (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or mean arterial blood pressure <60 mm Hg) and **evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion**, including **decreased mentation**, **cool extremities**, **low urine output**, or **lactate levels above 2.0 mEq/L (2.0 mmol/L)**.
2. Treatment of **cardiogenic shock** focuses on **remedying reversible causes** (especially **myocardial ischemia** with **revascularization**) and **supporting blood pressure and cardiac output** with **inotropic and vasopressor agents**.
3. **Percutaneous mechanical support** is an option in **severe cardiogenic shock** unresponsive to **vasopressor and inotropic therapy**.
4. Options for **percutaneous mechanical support** include **intra-aortic balloon pumps**, **percutaneous ventricular assist devices**, and **extracorporeal membrane oxygenators**.
5. **Intra-aortic balloon pump placement** is a reasonable next step in **severe cardiogenic shock with ongoing hypoperfusion** despite inotropic therapy.
6. **Biventricular pacemakers** are not indicated for patients in **cardiogenic shock** due to a lack of supporting evidence.
7. **Coronary angiography** is not indicated when **prior angiography within 1 year shows normal coronary arteries** and **no new ischemic symptoms** are present.
8. **Pulmonary artery pressure sensors** have **no known role** in the **acute management** of cardiogenic shock.

#### 💬 Extra
1. End-organ hypoperfusion signs reflect inadequate systemic perfusion and guide the diagnosis of shock severity.
2. Revascularization is a key intervention if cardiogenic shock is due to acute coronary syndrome.
3. These devices provide hemodynamic support and are increasingly used in critical care.
4. Device choice depends on institutional resources and the patient’s clinical trajectory.
5. The case describes a patient with persistent hypoperfusion on dobutamine therapy, indicating need for mechanical support.
6. Biventricular pacing may reduce mortality in chronic heart failure but is not supported in acute shock scenarios.
7. The decision against repeat coronary angiography is based on recent normal findings and low pretest probability.
8. These sensors are used in chronic outpatient heart failure management, not in urgent inpatient shock care.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiogenic shock** is characterized by **low cardiac output**, **hypotension**, and **end-organ hypoperfusion**, including **decreased mentation**, **cool extremities**, **low urine output**, or **lactate levels >2.0 mEq/L (2.0 mmol/L)**.
2. Initial treatment of **cardiogenic shock** includes **reversing the cause**, such as **reperfusion** in **acute coronary syndrome**, and **supporting blood pressure and cardiac output** with **inotropes and vasopressors**.
3. **Early recognition of cardiogenic shock** and **aggressive support** with **pressors** and **percutaneous assist devices** or **transfer to a shock center** are important to improve survival.
4. **Percutaneous mechanical support devices** can be placed rapidly to stabilize **critically ill patients**, including **intra-aortic balloon pumps**, **ventricular assist devices**, and **extracorporeal membrane oxygenators**.
5. A **shock team** consisting of a **heart failure physician**, **critical care physician**, and **cardiac surgeon** is recommended to rapidly deploy therapy and coordinate **postprocedure care**.
6. For patients who **do not improve clinically**, daily discussions should address **treatment goals**, including **transplantation**, **permanent left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** placement, or **palliative care**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Lactate is a biochemical marker of impaired perfusion.
2. Acute coronary syndrome is the most common reversible cause of cardiogenic shock.
3. Specialized centers may offer advanced therapies and better outcomes.
4. Mechanical circulatory support helps bridge to recovery or decision.
5. Multidisciplinary teams improve speed and coordination of critical interventions.
6. Decision-making includes ongoing assessment for candidacy for advanced therapies or comfort-focused care.
