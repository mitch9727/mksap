### 🫠 Transplantation Cardiology: Hypertension After Heart Transplant

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Hypertension** occurs in more than **90% of patients** after **heart transplantation**.
2. Common causes of **posttransplant hypertension** include **preexisting hypertension**, **donor characteristics** (such as **older donor age**, **male donor**, and **size mismatch**), and **immunosuppressive medications** (including **glucocorticoids** and **calcineurin inhibitors**).
3. Among **calcineurin inhibitors**, **tacrolimus** is associated with a **lower incidence of hypertension** compared with **cyclosporine**, and typically requires **fewer antihypertensive agents**.
4. **Calcium channel blockers**, particularly **amlodipine**, are the **preferred first-line antihypertensive agents** after **heart transplantation** due to **efficacy**, **tolerability**, and **minimal drug-drug interactions**.
5. **Diltiazem** is a **CYP3A4 inhibitor** and can **increase tacrolimus levels**, necessitating **dose adjustment** and **close monitoring** if used.
6. **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** such as **losartan** are less effective early after transplantation due to **low renin levels** and can **worsen kidney function and hyperkalemia**.
7. **Valsartan-sacubitril** is **not indicated** for **hypertension** or in **posttransplant patients**, and is **contraindicated** in patients with a **history of angioedema**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Careful management of hypertension is important in the early posttransplant period to prevent graft and end-organ damage.
2. Immunosuppressive regimens often include glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors, both of which contribute to hypertension.
4. Amlodipine avoids cytochrome P-450 interactions, unlike some other calcium channel blockers.
5. Despite its use in other cardiovascular conditions, diltiazem is not ideal posttransplant due to its impact on tacrolimus metabolism.
6. Early posttransplant patients typically have suppressed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity, limiting the efficacy of RAAS blockade.
7. This patient had a history of angioedema, making valsartan-sacubitril particularly unsafe.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Most patients** who undergo **heart transplantation** recover **normal quality of life** and have a **mean survival >11 years**.
2. The most frequent complication within the **first year after heart transplant** is **infection**, with **cytomegalovirus (CMV)** being common.
3. **CMV prophylaxis** with **valganciclovir** or **ganciclovir** is recommended for **6 months** in moderate- or high-risk patients.
4. The incidence of **rejection** is highest in the **first 6 months** after transplantation, and most early rejection episodes are **asymptomatic**.
5. **Routine endomyocardial biopsies** or **gene expression profiling** are used to detect **early rejection**.
6. **Severe transplant rejection** can present with **acute heart failure**, **atrial arrhythmias**, or **conduction abnormalities**.
7. **Hypertension** and **diabetes mellitus** are common **early complications** of **immunosuppressive therapy**, affecting >90% and 15–20% of patients, respectively.
8. **Long-term complications** after transplant include **coronary artery disease (CAD)** and **malignancies**, including **skin cancer** and **B-cell lymphoma**.
9. **Cyclosporine** and **tacrolimus** are metabolized by **cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4)** and have **substantial drug-drug interactions**.
10. **Cardiovascular medications** such as **diltiazem**, **verapamil**, and some **statins** (e.g., **atorvastatin**, **simvastatin**) can **inhibit CYP3A4** and affect immunosuppressant levels.

#### 💬 Extra
2. CMV risk stratification is based on the CMV serostatus of donor and recipient.
4. Asymptomatic rejection necessitates proactive screening through invasive or molecular methods.
8. Immunosuppression increases cancer risk, with skin cancer being the most common.
9. CYP3A4 modulation by cardiovascular drugs can increase toxicity or reduce efficacy of immunosuppressants.
