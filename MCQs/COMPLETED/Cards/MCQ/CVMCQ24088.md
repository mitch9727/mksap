### 🫠 Heart Failure: Diagnostic Role of BNP in Dyspnea Evaluation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** and **N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)** can help differentiate **heart failure** from **pulmonary and other noncardiac causes** in patients presenting with **dyspnea of unknown etiology**.
2. **BNP levels >400 pg/mL (400 ng/L)** have a **sensitivity of 95% to 97%** for diagnosing **heart failure**.
3. **BNP levels <100 pg/mL (100 ng/L)** have a **negative predictive value of 90% to 97%** for excluding **heart failure**.
4. **BNP levels** are typically **elevated** in **heart failure with elevated filling pressures** and **low to normal** in **pulmonary disease**.
5. Factors that may **increase BNP levels** include **older age**, **female sex**, **worsening kidney function**, and **sepsis**.
6. Factors that may **decrease BNP levels** include **obesity**.
7. **High-sensitivity cardiac troponin** levels may be **mildly increased** in **acute heart failure** due to **myocardial strain**, but are not optimal for differentiating causes of dyspnea.
8. **D-dimer testing** is not indicated in patients who meet **Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC)**.
9. A **high-resolution chest CT scan** is appropriate if **parenchymal lung disease** is suspected, but is not preferred in cases with **normal lung examination and imaging** findings.

#### 💬 Extra
1. BNP and NT-proBNP are elevated in response to **increased myocardial wall stretch** caused by **volume or pressure overload**.
2. Intermediate BNP levels between **100–400 pg/mL** are diagnostically ambiguous and should be interpreted in clinical context.
5. **Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)** therapy also increases BNP levels by reducing BNP degradation.
8. PERC includes: **age <50 years**, **heart rate <100 bpm**, **O₂ saturation >95%**, **no estrogen use**, **no unilateral leg swelling**, **no prior PE/DVT**, **no recent surgery or trauma**, and **no hemoptysis**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial diagnostic testing for **heart failure** includes **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **chest radiography**, and **laboratory studies**.
2. **Chest radiography** in heart failure may reveal **cardiomegaly**, **vascular congestion**, **Kerley B lines**, and **pleural effusions**.
3. **BNP levels** tend to be **lower in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** than in **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
4. **NT-proBNP <300 pg/mL** makes **heart failure very unlikely**.
5. **Age-specific NT-proBNP thresholds** for diagnosing heart failure are:   - **>450 pg/mL** for age <50 years   - **>900 pg/mL** for age 50–75 years   - **>1800 pg/mL** for age >75 years
6. **Laboratory evaluation** for heart failure should include **complete blood count**, **electrolytes**, **kidney function**, **glucose**, **lipid panel**, **liver chemistries**, **iron studies**, and **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**.
7. **Echocardiography** is the primary modality for evaluating **systolic and diastolic function**, **chamber size**, and **valvular disease** in heart failure.
8. **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** is used to assess for **myocarditis**, **amyloidosis**, **sarcoidosis**, and **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** when echocardiography is inconclusive.
9. **Elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures** can be documented by **BNP/NT-proBNP levels**, **echocardiographic criteria**, or **invasive hemodynamics**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. BNP may be less elevated in HFpEF due to **lower LV wall stress** compared to HFrEF.
6. **TSH** is used to evaluate for **thyroid-related heart failure**, and **iron studies** assess for **hemochromatosis**.
9. **LV filling pressure elevation** is a diagnostic criterion for **HFpEF**, **HFmrEF**, and **HFrEF**.
