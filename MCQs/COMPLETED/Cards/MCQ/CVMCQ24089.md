#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stage B heart failure** includes patients with **reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%)** and no symptoms.
2. Treatment of **stage B heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** includes **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** and **β-blockers**.
3. **ACE inhibitors** reduce **mortality**, **heart failure hospitalizations**, and **worsening of heart failure** in asymptomatic patients with **reduced ejection fraction after myocardial infarction (MI)**.
4. **Valsartan-sacubitril** has **not been studied** in patients with **stage B (asymptomatic) heart failure**.
5. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** such as **diltiazem** and **verapamil** have **negative inotropic effects** and should **not be used** in patients with **reduced ejection fraction**.
6. **Guideline-directed therapy** in stage B HFrEF includes both a **β-blocker** and an **ACE inhibitor** or **ARB** if tolerated.
7. In patients with **ACE inhibitor–induced cough**, an **ARB** should be used instead.
8. **Angioedema** is a potential side effect of both **ACE inhibitors** and **ARBs**, though less common with ARBs.
9. **β-Blockers** improve **left ventricular remodeling**, increase **ejection fraction**, and reduce **mortality and hospitalization** in HFrEF.
10. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should not be used within **36 hours** of the last dose of an **ACE inhibitor**.
11. **Valsartan-sacubitril** is **contraindicated** in patients with a **history of angioedema**.
12. **Calcium channel blockers** such as **amlodipine** and **felodipine** may be used in HFrEF patients with persistent hypertension but have shown **neither benefit nor harm**.
13. **Statins** should not be used routinely in patients with HFrEF without another accepted indication.
14. **Echocardiography** should be repeated **3 months** after initial assessment of new-onset HFrEF **after medical optimization**, but **not routinely** thereafter unless there is a **change in clinical status** or planned **device intervention**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Structural or hemodynamic abnormalities (e.g., reduced EF) without symptoms define stage B.
2. This reflects current American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines.
3. The benefit of ACE inhibitors is supported by trials in patients with reduced EF post-MI.
4. The benefit of valsartan-sacubitril is demonstrated only in symptomatic patients (stage C or D).
5. Their negative inotropic effects can worsen systolic dysfunction.
6. Both classes are foundational in preventing progression to symptomatic heart failure.
7. Cough affects up to 20% of ACE inhibitor users.
8. There are rare reports of ARB-induced angioedema.
9. Clinical benefits apply only to specific agents: **bisoprolol**, **carvedilol**, and **metoprolol succinate**.
10. This washout period reduces the risk of angioedema from ACE/ARNI overlap.
11. Even patients tolerant of ARBs may not safely receive ARNIs after prior angioedema.
12. They can be considered if other agents are maximized and BP control is still needed.
13. Clinical trials showed no added benefit of statins in HFrEF patients without another indication (e.g., atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease).
14. Surveillance echocardiography is discouraged in clinically stable patients.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These are the only two drug classes currently endorsed for stage B therapy.
2. These therapies are supported by guideline-directed algorithms for symptomatic patients (stage C or D).
3. Valsartan-sacubitril has demonstrated benefit in symptomatic patients in the PARADIGM-HF trial.
4. Safety concerns with valsartan-sacubitril include hypotension and risk of angioedema.
5. ACE inhibitors block angiotensin II formation, ARBs block its receptor; both reduce afterload and fibrosis.
6. These agents uniquely demonstrated mortality benefit in randomized trials.
7. Initiating during decompensation may worsen heart failure symptoms.
8. Trials show benefit independent of glucose-lowering effect; renal thresholds apply for use.
9. These agents worsen systolic function and are contraindicated in HFrEF.
10. Routine imaging is not necessary unless guiding device decisions or assessing new symptoms.
11. This threshold reflects common nephrology and cardiology practice to avoid worsening renal function.
12. Hypotension risk is increased due to neprilysin inhibition.
13. Hospital initiation ensures tolerability and smoother outpatient titration.
14. Aldosterone antagonists are for neurohormonal blockade, not diuresis.
15. This is due to eplerenone’s higher receptor selectivity.
16. Ketoacidosis risk makes SGLT2 inhibitors unsafe in these populations.
17. Higher doses may worsen electrolyte imbalances without added benefit.
18. This timing enhances synergistic action on nephron segments.
19. It is often used for rate control in atrial fibrillation with HFrEF.
20. Renal clearance and volume distribution affect toxicity thresholds.
21. Early ICD placement may be unnecessary if EF improves.
22. Screening improves quality of life and management.
23. Increased mortality with adaptive servoventilation was shown in clinical trials.
24. Lifestyle modification is low-risk, but evidence of outcome impact is weak.
25. Sudden weight gain can signal fluid retention before symptom onset.
26. Medication education and caregiver planning are key elements at discharge.
27. Identifying barriers (e.g., cost, cognition) improves compliance.
28. NSAIDs antagonize diuretic effect and promote fluid retention.
29. Initiating all four pillars early maximizes mortality and hospitalization benefit.
30. Regression of EF does not equate to cured disease; relapse risk remains.
31. The trial showed a 3% absolute risk reduction in the composite outcome.
32. These factors signal end-stage disease requiring specialist input.
33. Readmission is common and carries significant prognostic weight.
34. Prognostic awareness can guide shared decision-making and end-of-life care.
41. The higher 50 mg twice daily dose of carvedilol is recommended for patients weighing over 85 kg (187 lb), based on heart failure dosing guidelines.
42. The 200 mg daily dose of metoprolol succinate reflects the maximum studied in major trials that demonstrated benefit in HFrEF.
43. The 10 mg daily target dose for bisoprolol was used in the CIBIS-II trial, which showed reduced mortality in HFrEF.
44. Metformin is beneficial unless contraindicated, such as in patients with lactic acidosis risk or hemodynamic instability (e.g., cardiogenic shock).
45. Pioglitazone increases fluid retention and the risk of decompensated heart failure, especially in NYHA class II-IV.
46. SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated benefit in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF regardless of diabetes status in the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR trials.
47. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce atherosclerotic events, but clinical trials in HF patients have shown no clear benefit or harm.
48. DPP-4 inhibitors, particularly saxagliptin, have been linked to increased HF hospitalizations in some studies, prompting caution.
49. Sulfonylureas are commonly used in diabetes management but lack randomized trial data supporting efficacy or safety in heart failure.
50. Insulin may worsen heart failure through mechanisms such as fluid retention, weight gain, and neurohormonal activation.
51. A waiting period of at least 40 days post-MI is recommended before ICD placement to allow reassessment of ejection fraction, as some patients recover.
52. CRT is not indicated in NYHA class I because evidence shows little benefit without symptomatic heart failure, even with reduced EF.
53. CRT is most effective in symptomatic HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm, LBBB, EF ≤35%, and QRS ≥150 ms, where it improves synchrony and outcomes.
54. Guidelines stipulate that CRT and ICD should only be used in patients on maximally tolerated heart failure therapy with an anticipated survival of at least 1 year.

    Treatment recommendations for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are displayed. Green indicates a class 1 (strong), yellow a class 2a (moderate), and orange a class 2b (weak) recommendation. Step 1 medications may be started simultaneously at initial (low) doses recommended for HFrEF. Alternatively, these medications may be started sequentially, with sequence guided by clinical or other factors, without the need to achieve target dosing before initiating the next medication. Medication doses should be increased to target as tolerated. Although current guidelines support the use of isosorbide dinitrate–hydralazine in Black patients, making management decisions on the basis of skin color is likely a flawed approach. Questions regarding the underlying studies and the appropriateness of using race to direct management are driving a reevaluation of these recommendations.<br>
