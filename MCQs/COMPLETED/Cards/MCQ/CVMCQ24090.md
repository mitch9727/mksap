### 🫠 Heart Failure: Iron Deficiency Treatment

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients with **heart failure** should be evaluated for **anemia**, which is associated with heart failure severity and mortality.
2. **Iron deficiency**, even in patients with **hemoglobin levels between 12 and 15 g/dL (120–150 g/L)**, is associated with **reduced functional ability** and **increased mortality**.
3. Treatment of **iron deficiency** in heart failure with **intravenous iron** improves **New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class**, **functional capacity**, and **quality of life**, **independent of the degree or presence of anemia**.
4. The **HEART-FID trial** found **no difference** in the composite of **death**, **heart failure hospitalizations**, or **6-minute walk distance** with intravenous iron treatment.
5. **All patients with iron deficiency** should be treated **regardless of hemoglobin level**.
6. **Intravenous iron** is the **preferred method** of iron repletion in patients with **iron deficiency and heart failure**.
7. **Oral iron supplementation** has **not been shown** to improve **functional capacity** in patients with iron deficiency and heart failure.
8. The **erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) darbepoetin** does **not decrease** the risk for **death** or **heart failure hospitalization** in heart failure with anemia.
9. **Erythropoietin-stimulating agents** are indicated only in patients with **advanced kidney disease**, **hemoglobin <10 g/dL (100 g/L)**, and **after iron repletion**.
10. **Blood transfusion** is not indicated for **hemodynamically stable** patients with heart failure unless hemoglobin is **<7 g/dL (70 g/L)**.
11. **Blood transfusion** should be avoided in the context of **volume overload** in heart failure.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Several trials have shown intravenous iron improves outcomes such as functional status and quality of life in heart failure, even when anemia is not present.
4. The HEART-FID trial introduced caution by showing no improvement in a composite clinical endpoint.
5. Guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency even when hemoglobin is in the normal or near-normal range.
6. Intravenous iron achieves better repletion in the context of chronic inflammation and absorption impairment common in heart failure.
8. Darbepoetin may be useful in kidney failure-related anemia but not in heart failure alone.
10. A conservative transfusion threshold is supported by outcome studies and guidelines.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients should be evaluated at baseline for **anemia**, which is independently associated with **heart failure severity**.
2. **Iron deficiency** is linked to **reduced functional capacity** in patients with heart failure.
3. Several small studies have shown **improvement in functional capacity and quality of life** with **intravenous iron replacement** in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency.
4. A recent randomized trial found **no difference** between **intravenous ferric carboxymaltose** and **placebo** for the composite endpoint of **death**, **heart failure hospitalizations**, and **6-minute walk distance** in **ambulatory patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and iron deficiency**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Anemia evaluation is part of guideline-directed baseline workup in heart failure management.
4. The trial referenced is likely the HEART-FID trial, which tempers enthusiasm for universal intravenous iron use in all HFrEF patients.
