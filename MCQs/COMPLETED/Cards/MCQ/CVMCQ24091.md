### 🫠 Heart Failure: Valsartan-Sacubitril in Symptomatic HFrEF

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Valsartan-sacubitril**, a combination of **angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)** and **neprilysin inhibitor**, is associated with improved mortality and reduced heart failure hospitalizations compared with **enalapril** in symptomatic **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
2. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should replace **ACE inhibitors** or **ARBs** in patients with **chronic symptomatic HFrEF** (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II–IV symptoms and **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%**).
3. **Valsartan-sacubitril** has a significant **blood pressure–lowering effect** and should be used with caution in patients with **hypotension**.
4. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should not be initiated within **36 hours** of the last **ACE inhibitor** dose due to increased **angioedema risk**.
5. **Valsartan-sacubitril** is contraindicated in patients with a **history of ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema**.
6. When initiating **valsartan-sacubitril** in patients with **kidney dysfunction**, dosage should be adjusted, especially if the **estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)** is less than **60 mL/min/1.73 m²**.
7. In patients with **eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, **kidney function** should be monitored closely when using **valsartan-sacubitril**.
8. **Ivabradine** reduces **heart failure hospitalization** and **cardiovascular death** in patients with symptomatic **HFrEF** and a **heart rate >70/min** despite maximal **β-blocker** therapy.
9. **Vericiguat**, a soluble **guanylyl cyclase stimulator**, is indicated for symptomatic **HFrEF** with **elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** and recent **hospitalization** or **intravenous diuretic therapy**.
10. There is no evidence supporting a switch between β-blockers such as from **carvedilol** to **bisoprolol** in **HFrEF**, as no trials demonstrate superiority among the three approved agents.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The benefit of **valsartan-sacubitril** over **enalapril** was shown in the PARADIGM-HF trial.
2. **Guidelines** recommend ARNI therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite ACE/ARB.
3. Neprilysin inhibition increases **natriuretic peptides**, lowering blood pressure.
4. Combination with ACE inhibitors increases **bradykinin**, potentiating **angioedema** risk.
5. Even patients who tolerate ARBs after ACE-induced angioedema are still at risk with ARNIs.
6. Initiating at half-dose helps mitigate adverse effects in **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**.
8. This patient’s **heart rate** of 58/min makes them **ineligible** for **ivabradine**.
9. This patient has **not been recently hospitalized** nor required IV diuretics, so **vericiguat** is not appropriate.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Valsartan-sacubitril** reduces **mortality** and **heart failure hospitalization** by 20% compared with **enalapril** in patients with symptomatic **HFrEF** and **LVEF <40%**, per the **PARADIGM-HF trial**.
2. **Neprilysin** is a **neutral endopeptidase** that degrades **natriuretic peptides** and **bradykinin**; its inhibition enhances **diuresis**, **natriuresis**, and **myocardial relaxation**.
3. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should not be given within **36 hours** of the last **ACE inhibitor** dose due to risk of **angioedema**.
4. **Valsartan-sacubitril** is contraindicated in patients with a **history of angioedema**, even if previously tolerant of **ARBs**.
5. **Valsartan-sacubitril** increases the incidence of **hypotension** but decreases **acute kidney injury**, **hyperkalemia**, and **cough** compared with **enalapril**.
6. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should not be used in patients with **asymptomatic (stage B)** heart failure, as no evidence supports its use in this population.
7. The **FDA** has approved **valsartan-sacubitril** for **chronic heart failure** across the **entire spectrum of LVEF**, but the **strongest benefits** are seen in patients with **reduced ejection fraction**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The trial enrolled patients with NYHA class II–IV symptoms and EF <40%.
2. **Increased natriuretic peptides** improve preload and ventricular relaxation.
3. Washout prevents overlapping bradykinin effects, lowering **angioedema risk**.
4. Neprilysin inhibition may unmask angioedema tendencies even without ACE involvement.
5. Reduction in cough may reflect neprilysin's effects on bradykinin metabolism.
6. Trials demonstrating benefit were limited to symptomatic HFrEF patients.
7. Benefit in patients with **preserved EF** is not yet definitively established.
