### 🫠 Heart Failure: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in HFrEF

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** is indicated in patients with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, **left bundle branch block (LBBB)**, and **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms** to reduce heart failure symptoms, improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and lower mortality.
2. Patients with **LBBB** are most likely to benefit from **CRT**, although those without LBBB but with a **QRS complex duration ≥150 milliseconds** may also derive benefit.
3. Patients meeting criteria for **CRT** typically also qualify for an **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** and may receive a combined **CRT-ICD** device.
4. A **left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** is indicated for patients with **LVEF <25%**, **NYHA class III/IV symptoms**, **poor exercise tolerance**, and **high 1- to 2-year mortality** or **inotrope dependence**, despite maximal therapy.
5. **Intravenous inotropes** such as **milrinone** or **dobutamine** are indicated in **cardiogenic shock** or **low perfusion** unresponsive to all other therapies, including **CRT**.
6. **Implanted pulmonary artery pressure sensors** reduce **heart failure–related hospitalizations** but have not been shown to improve **mortality**.
7. **CRT** is preferred over inotropes or pulmonary artery sensors for eligible patients with **HFrEF**, **LVEF <35%**, and **LBBB** who have **worsening symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient has NYHA class III symptoms, LBBB, and an ejection fraction <35%, making CRT appropriate.
3. Combined CRT-ICD devices provide both resynchronization and protection from ventricular arrhythmias.
4. LVADs are considered advanced therapies and are reserved for those who fail CRT or are in late-stage heart failure.
5. Although this patient may have cardiorenal syndrome, he is not in cardiogenic shock, making CRT the better option.
6. Pulmonary artery sensors allow for remote monitoring but lack mortality benefit in randomized trials.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)**, also known as **biventricular pacing**, involves pacing the **right ventricular apex** and the **left ventricular (LV) lateral wall** via a lead in the **coronary sinus**.
2. **CRT** improves **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)**, reduces **heart failure symptoms**, and decreases **mortality** in patients with **electrical dyssynchrony**.
3. Patients with **left bundle branch block (LBBB)** benefit most from **CRT**, although patients without LBBB but with a **QRS duration ≥150 milliseconds** may also benefit to a lesser degree.
4. **CRT** is typically used in conjunction with an **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** in patients who meet criteria for both therapies, and a combined **CRT-defibrillator device (CRT-D)** is indicated.
5. **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** is indicated in **NYHA class I** patients with **ejection fraction (EF) ≤30%** at least **40 days after myocardial infarction (MI)**.
6. **ICD therapy** is indicated in **NYHA class II or III** patients with **EF ≤35%**.
7. **ICD therapy** is indicated in **NYHA class IV** patients **only if** they are being considered for **heart transplantation**.
8. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** is not indicated in **NYHA class I** regardless of ejection fraction or QRS duration.
9. **CRT is indicated** in **NYHA class II–IV** patients with **EF ≤35%**, **sinus rhythm**, **left bundle branch block (LBBB)**, and a **QRS duration ≥150 milliseconds**.
10. **CRT-Pacing (CRT-P)** devices include a **pulse generator and intravascular leads**, with one lead in the **coronary sinus** to **pace the left ventricle**.
11. **CRT-Defibrillator (CRT-D)** devices combine **pacing** and **defibrillation** functions and are indicated for **electrical resynchronization and ventricular arrhythmia prevention**.
12. A **transvenous pacemaker** includes a **pulse generator and intravascular leads**, and is indicated for **sinus node dysfunction**, **atrioventricular (AV) block**, or **nonreversible symptomatic bradycardia**.
13. A **leadless pacemaker** is entirely self-contained within the **cardiac chamber**, and is indicated for **atrial fibrillation with bradycardia** or **paroxysmal bradycardia**.
14. An **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** includes **defibrillator and intravascular leads** and is used to **monitor and treat ventricular arrhythmias**.
15. A **subcutaneous ICD** includes a **single extravascular lead** and **lacks transvenous access**, providing **defibrillation without pacing** capability.
16. **CRT-P** provides **pacemaker function only**, while **CRT-D** provides both **pacing and defibrillation** capabilities.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The LV lead is inserted through the **coronary sinus** into a lateral cardiac vein to achieve synchronized biventricular pacing.
2. Electrical dyssynchrony refers to delayed activation of the LV, often due to LBBB, which CRT corrects.
4. Combining CRT with ICD therapy addresses both **resynchronization** and **ventricular arrhythmia prevention**.
5. The waiting period after MI allows time for EF recovery before determining ICD eligibility.
7. NYHA class IV patients with poor prognosis and no transplant plan are not candidates for ICD.
8. CRT provides no benefit in asymptomatic heart failure, even with electrical dyssynchrony.
9. CRT improves outcomes by restoring synchrony; LBBB with wide QRS is the optimal target.
10. The coronary sinus route allows targeted pacing of the LV lateral wall to correct dyssynchrony.
11. CRT-D devices are preferred when both pacing and arrhythmia protection are needed.
12. Dual-chamber transvenous systems are commonly used for broader pacing needs.
13. Leadless systems are typically reserved for patients without venous access or high infection risk.
14. Subcutaneous ICDs are used when pacing is not required, such as in younger patients or those with vascular access limitations.
