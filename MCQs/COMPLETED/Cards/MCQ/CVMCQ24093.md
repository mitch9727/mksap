### 🫠 Heart Failure: HFpEF with Atrial Fibrillation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** and **new-onset atrial fibrillation**, initiation of a **β-blocker** is an appropriate strategy for **rate control**.
2. Primary therapies for **HFpEF** include **diuretics** to control volume overload symptoms, **blood pressure control**, **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors**, and inhibition of the **renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system** with **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** or **angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)**.
3. In patients with **HFpEF** and **worsened symptoms** accompanied by **atrial fibrillation**, **rate control and/or restoration of sinus rhythm** can reduce symptoms.
4. **Amiodarone** is not first-line therapy for rate control in new-onset atrial fibrillation in stable patients due to the risk of conversion to sinus rhythm and consequent **stroke risk**.
5. **Digoxin** is considered a **second-line agent** for **rate control** in atrial fibrillation because of its **narrow therapeutic window**.
6. **Immediate cardioversion** is not indicated in **atrial fibrillation >48 hours duration** unless **anticoagulation** has been provided or **transesophageal echocardiography** has ruled out **left atrial thrombus**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The β-blocker helps improve rate control and reduce symptoms associated with atrial fibrillation in patients without significant volume overload.
2. These therapies are standard for long-term management of HFpEF.
3. Atrial fibrillation can exacerbate heart failure symptoms by reducing cardiac output, especially in HFpEF.
4. Amiodarone may be used later to maintain sinus rhythm after cardioversion or ablation.
5. β-Blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred as first-line agents in patients with normal ejection fraction.
6. This patient is stable, and cardioversion without prior anticoagulation would pose a significant stroke risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The incidence of **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** increases with **age**, and affected patients are more likely to be **older**, **female**, have **obesity**, and **hypertension**.
2. Patients hospitalized with **HFpEF** are **less likely to have overt coronary artery disease (CAD)** than those with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
3. **Primary therapies** for **HFpEF** include **diuretics** to control volume overload and **antihypertensive therapy** to maintain **systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg**.
4. The **2022 ACC/AHA heart failure guidelines** issued a **Class 2a recommendation** for use of **SGLT2 inhibitors** in HFpEF to reduce **hospitalization** and **cardiovascular mortality**.
5. **Aldosterone antagonists** may be considered in selected patients with **HFpEF** who have **elevated BNP** or a **recent heart failure hospitalization**.
6. The **TOPCAT trial** showed that **spironolactone** reduced **hospitalizations** in HFpEF but had **regional variation in efficacy**.
7. **Valsartan-sacubitril** was approved by the FDA for **heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum**, based on the **PARAGON-HF trial**, which showed a **non-significant reduction** in hospitalization or cardiovascular death, with **suggested benefit** in patients with **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 45–55%**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Age, sex, body weight, and blood pressure are common risk factors for HFpEF.
2. This contrasts with HFrEF, which is more often ischemic in origin.
3. Guideline targets recommend tight blood pressure control in HFpEF.
4. These medications now have a broader role in HFpEF management.
5. Aldosterone antagonists are considered when biomarkers or recent admissions indicate higher risk.
6. Benefit of spironolactone was seen primarily in U.S. patients.
7. FDA approval for broader use of valsartan-sacubitril was based on subgroup benefit in mid-range EF.
