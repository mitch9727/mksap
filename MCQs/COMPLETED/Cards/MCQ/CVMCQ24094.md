### 🫠 Heart Failure: Coronary Artery Disease Evaluation in New-Onset HFrEF

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** is the leading cause of **heart failure** in the United States, responsible for more than 50% of cases.
2. All patients with **newly diagnosed heart failure** should be evaluated for **underlying coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
3. In patients with **new-onset heart failure**, the choice between **stress testing** and **coronary angiography** to evaluate for CAD depends on symptoms, risk factors, and findings on **electrocardiogram (ECG)** and **echocardiogram**.
4. Identifying **CAD** in patients with **left ventricular dysfunction** is important because **revascularization** may improve or reverse ventricular dysfunction if ischemia is present.
5. In patients with **high likelihood of CAD**, **invasive coronary angiography** is preferred over noninvasive testing for anatomic assessment.
6. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** may be used to evaluate **myocarditis**, **infarction**, **ischemia**, or **infiltrative cardiomyopathies**, especially when common causes of heart failure have been excluded.
7. **Endomyocardial biopsy** is reserved for patients in whom **myocarditis**, **amyloidosis**, or **iron overload** is suspected and diagnosis would change management.
8. **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** placement is not indicated at the time of **initial heart failure diagnosis**, and is deferred until after a period of **guideline-directed medical therapy**: typically **≥40 days post-myocardial infarction** or **≥3 months in nonischemic cardiomyopathy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient is young but has multiple CAD risk factors, including **family history**, **tobacco use**, and **ECG Q waves**, making CAD a plausible cause of **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
6. CMR is appropriate if the cause of heart failure remains unclear after excluding CAD or if **myocarditis or infiltrative disease** is suspected.
8. Some patients with **new-onset heart failure** improve significantly on medical therapy and may no longer meet criteria for **ICD placement** after reassessment.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Coronary artery disease (CAD)** should be considered in **all patients with newly diagnosed heart failure**, regardless of age.
2. **Stress testing** or **coronary angiography** should be selected based on the patient’s **symptoms**, **risk factors** (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, tobacco use, family history, male sex), and findings on **electrocardiogram (ECG)** and **echocardiogram**.
3. **Patients with exertional chest pain**, a **history of myocardial infarction**, or other symptoms suggesting CAD should undergo **functional or anatomic assessment** for **obstructive CAD**.
4. Identification of **significant CAD** is important because **left ventricular dysfunction** caused by **ischemia** may improve with **medical therapy** or **revascularization**.
5. Some studies suggest **revascularization** does not improve mortality or hospitalization in patients with **viable myocardium** and **ischemic cardiomyopathy** compared with **medical therapy alone**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This includes even patients without classic symptoms if they have substantial **CAD risk factors** or suspicious imaging findings.
2. **Q waves on ECG** or **segmental wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram** may indicate underlying ischemia and warrant invasive evaluation.
5. Trials like **REVIVED-BCIS2** challenge the assumption that all viable ischemic myocardium benefits from revascularization.
