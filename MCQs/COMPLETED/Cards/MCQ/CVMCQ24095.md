### 🫠 Heart Failure: HFpEF Treatment and Volume Overload

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** results from **diastolic dysfunction** caused by abnormal relaxation of a stiffened **left ventricular (LV) myocardium** and increased LV preload.
2. **Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)** in HFpEF is normal, defined as **≥50%**.
3. Causes of HFpEF include **hypertension**, **aging**, **obesity**, **diabetes**, and **atrial fibrillation**.
4. **Transthyretin amyloid deposits** have been reported in **>10%** of patients with HFpEF.
5. Treatment priorities for HFpEF include **control of blood pressure** and **relief of volume overload**.
6. Guideline-recommended medications in HFpEF include **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors**, **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** or **angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)**, and **aldosterone antagonists**.
7. **Loop diuretics** such as **furosemide** are used for **volume overload** in HFpEF.
8. **SGLT2 inhibitors** reduce the combined endpoint of **heart failure hospitalization and cardiac death** in patients with HFpEF.
9. **SGLT2 inhibitors** are contraindicated in patients with **type 1 diabetes mellitus** due to increased risk of **diabetic ketoacidosis**.
10. **Calcium channel blockers** and **β-blockers** were traditionally used in HFpEF with volume overload, but **no benefit** has been shown and this approach is no longer recommended.
11. **Tafamidis** improves **survival** and **functional capacity** in patients with **cardiac amyloidosis** due to wild-type or mutant **transthyretin**, but further diagnostic studies are required before initiation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Diastolic dysfunction impairs ventricular filling, leading to symptoms of heart failure despite preserved ejection fraction.
2. LVEF ≥50% is one of the diagnostic criteria for HFpEF.
3. These comorbid conditions contribute to myocardial stiffening and diastolic dysfunction.
4. Transthyretin gene mutations and wild-type deposits both contribute to amyloid-related HFpEF.
5. Management of blood pressure and volume status is foundational in HFpEF care.
6. These medications are suggested based on guideline recommendations to improve outcomes in HFpEF.
7. Loop diuretics are preferred for immediate symptomatic relief of fluid retention.
8. Clinical trials have shown improved quality of life and reduced hospitalization with SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF.
9. Dapagliflozin and similar agents should be avoided in type 1 diabetes due to risk of ketoacidosis.
10. The shift away from calcium channel blockers and β-blockers reflects updated evidence-based practice.
11. Diagnostic evaluation for amyloidosis includes **cardiac magnetic resonance imaging** and **technetium pyrophosphate scan**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The incidence of **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** increases with **age**, but younger individuals may also be affected.
2. Patients hospitalized with HFpEF are more likely to be **older**, **female**, **obese**, and **hypertensive**, and less likely to have **coronary artery disease (CAD)** than those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
3. Primary therapies for HFpEF include **diuretics** for **volume overload** and **antihypertensive agents** targeting a **systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg**.
4. In patients with **HFpEF and atrial fibrillation**, **restoration of sinus rhythm** or **rate control** may reduce symptoms.
5. The **2022 ACC/AHA guidelines** give a **class 2a recommendation** for **SGLT2 inhibitors** in HFpEF to reduce **hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality**.
6. **Aldosterone antagonists** may be considered in HFpEF patients with **elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** or **recent heart failure hospitalization**, to reduce hospitalization risk.
7. The **TOPCAT trial** showed that **spironolactone** reduced **hospitalizations** but not the composite endpoint of **death, cardiac arrest, or hospitalization** in HFpEF.
8. The **PARAGON-HF trial** showed a **nonsignificant reduction** in heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death with **valsartan-sacubitril** in HFpEF.
9. Based on PARAGON-HF, the **FDA expanded indications** for **valsartan-sacubitril** to include **all patients with heart failure**, regardless of ejection fraction.
10. Benefits from **valsartan-sacubitril** were primarily seen in patients with an **LVEF between 45% and 55%**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Age-related myocardial stiffening contributes to increased HFpEF prevalence in older adults.
2. This demographic distinction helps guide tailored management strategies in different heart failure phenotypes.
3. Controlling volume and blood pressure reduces symptoms and hospitalizations.
4. Rhythm management in atrial fibrillation improves cardiac output and quality of life in HFpEF.
5. Class 2a indicates moderate-quality evidence with likely benefit outweighing risk.
6. The recommendation for aldosterone antagonists is based on subgroup findings from large trials.
7. The TOPCAT trial revealed geographic differences in response, with benefits mostly observed in U.S. patients.
8. Though the primary endpoint was not statistically significant, secondary analysis suggested potential subgroup benefit.
9. Regulatory decisions were based on the totality of evidence suggesting benefit in certain HFpEF subgroups.
10. These findings influenced FDA labeling despite modest average benefit across all HFpEF patients.
