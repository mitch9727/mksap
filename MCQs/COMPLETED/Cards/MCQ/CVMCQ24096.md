### 🫠 Heart Failure: Primary Prevention

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Hypertension** and **type 2 diabetes mellitus** are the two greatest modifiable risk factors for developing **heart failure**.
2. Lowering **systolic blood pressure** to a target of **<130/80 mm Hg** reduces the incidence of **heart failure**, with approximately a **28 %** risk reduction for every 10‑mm Hg decrease.
3. Initiating an **angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor**, such as **lisinopril**, is an effective pharmacologic strategy to lower blood pressure and prevent **heart failure** in patients whose hypertension remains uncontrolled on lifestyle therapy.
4. **Weight loss**, **regular aerobic exercise**, and **smoking cessation** are recommended lifestyle interventions to decrease **heart failure** risk.
5. **Aspirin** is **not** recommended for primary cardiovascular prevention in adults aged **≥60 years** without known coronary artery disease because the bleeding risk outweighs potential benefit for **heart failure** prevention.
6. **Spironolactone** and **thiazide diuretics** are **not** first‑line choices for preventing **heart failure** in hypertensive patients with diabetes; **ACE inhibitors** or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** are preferred because they lower blood pressure and confer renal protection.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Control of hypertension and diabetes accounts for most of the preventable heart failure burden in population studies.
2. Meta‑analytic data across randomized trials link each 10‑mm Hg systolic reduction to a near‑30 % drop in new‑onset heart failure.
3. ACE inhibitors improve vascular compliance and mitigate diabetic nephropathy, providing dual benefit in hypertensive patients with proteinuria.
4. Lifestyle measures enhance weight control and insulin sensitivity, augmenting pharmacologic blood pressure reduction.
5. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines discourage aspirin initiation for primary prevention in older adults without atherosclerotic disease.
6. Thiazide diuretics can worsen glucose metabolism, and spironolactone is reserved for symptomatic heart failure rather than prevention.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Outpatient follow‑up for **chronic heart failure** should include assessment of symptoms, functional capacity, volume status, renal function, electrolytes, and the appropriateness and dosage of **guideline‑directed medical therapy**.
2. Repeated **patient education** and non‑judgmental evaluation of medication adherence and lifestyle barriers improve outcomes in **heart failure**.
3. **Sleep‑disordered breathing** is common in **heart failure**; persistent obstructive sleep apnea should be treated with **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**, whereas **adaptive servoventilation (ASV)** increases mortality in patients with **left ventricular ejection fraction <45 %** and central sleep apnea.
4. Routine surveillance **echocardiography** is **not** recommended in stable **chronic heart failure**; left ventricular function should be reassessed only after therapy optimization or when clinical status changes.
5. Serial measurement of **B‑type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** has **not** been shown to reduce hospitalizations or mortality in **heart failure**, despite its diagnostic and prognostic utility.
6. **Multidisciplinary team–based care**, especially at the time of **hospital discharge**, reduces readmissions in **heart failure**.
7. **Daily weight monitoring** is recommended because rapid weight gain can serve as an early marker of **heart failure decompensation**.
8. **Non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** increase blood pressure and exacerbate volume overload; they should be avoided in patients with **heart failure**.
9. **Cardiac rehabilitation** and structured exercise training improve functional capacity, exercise duration, and quality of life in **heart failure**.
10. Clinical indicators such as multiple recent hospitalizations, NYHA class III–IV symptoms, hyponatremia, and recurrent **implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD)** discharges signal a poor prognosis and should prompt consideration of advanced therapies or palliative care.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Failure to titrate β‑blockers, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium‑glucose cotransporter‑2 inhibitors contributes to progressive ventricular dysfunction.
2. Addressing cost, cognitive limitations, and social determinants enhances adherence.
3. Guideline‑directed medical therapy often ameliorates sleep apnea severity before formal sleep testing.
4. Repeat imaging before device implantation (e.g., ICD, CRT) confirms persistent systolic dysfunction.
5. BNP‑guided therapy algorithms have not demonstrated survival benefit in randomized trials.
6. Team members typically include primary care physicians, cardiologists, pharmacists, nurses, and social workers.
7. Weight gain of ≥2 kg in 3 days typically precedes symptomatic congestion.
8. NSAIDs antagonize loop diuretics and promote renal sodium retention.
9. The HF‑ACTION trial showed survival or hospitalization benefit in high‑risk subgroups despite only modest overall effect.
10. In‑hospital heart failure exacerbations carry a 10–20 % six‑month mortality, underscoring the need for timely referral.
