### 🫠 Heart Failure: Outpatient Evaluation and Kidney Monitoring

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients with **chronic heart failure** should be serially assessed for **disease progression** at each follow-up visit.
2. Follow-up visits for **chronic heart failure** should include evaluation of **current symptoms**, **functional capacity**, **volume status**, **electrolytes**, and **kidney function**.
3. Review of the **medication regimen** is essential at each chronic heart failure visit to ensure adherence to **guideline-directed medical therapy**.
4. Routine **echocardiography** is not indicated in clinically stable patients with **chronic heart failure** unless there is a **change in clinical status** or a **planned intervention** such as **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** or **biventricular pacemaker** placement.
5. **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** levels may be useful for assessing **prognosis** in patients with **stable heart failure** but do not improve **mortality** or **hospitalization rates** when used serially for treatment guidance.
6. **Cardiopulmonary exercise testing** is used to evaluate **advanced heart failure** symptoms and is typically reserved for determining eligibility for **heart transplantation** or **left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** placement.
7. **Stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)** is not indicated in asymptomatic patients with **coronary artery disease (CAD)** and stable **heart failure**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Disease progression may be silent and requires consistent surveillance even in stable patients.
2. Monitoring kidney function and electrolytes helps prevent complications from medications like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs.
3. Ensuring the patient is on the appropriate medications and doses is critical to maintaining symptom control and slowing disease progression.
4. Routine imaging without clinical change adds cost and may not provide actionable findings.
5. BNP-guided therapy has not been shown to influence outcomes in stable patients and is not recommended as part of routine management.
6. This patient had stable symptoms and did not require advanced testing.
7. This patient has no new symptoms suggestive of ischemia, making MPI unnecessary.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **chronic heart failure** should undergo serial outpatient evaluation for **disease progression**.
2. Routine follow-up in chronic heart failure should include evaluation of **symptoms**, **functional capacity**, **volume status**, **electrolytes**, **kidney function**, and **medications**.
3. **Nonjudgmental assessment of adherence** and **repeated patient education** are critical components of chronic heart failure care.
4. **Sleep-disordered breathing** is underdiagnosed in patients with **heart failure**, and formal sleep assessment is recommended in symptomatic patients with suspected **obstructive or central sleep apnea**.
5. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** improves sleep quality and apnea–hypopnea index in **obstructive sleep apnea** but **adaptive servoventilation** should be avoided in **central sleep apnea** with **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45%** due to increased mortality risk.
6. **Echocardiography** should be repeated in **new-onset heart failure** after optimization of therapy but not as routine surveillance without clinical change or planned device therapy.
7. **Serial BNP measurements** in **stable heart failure** patients do not reduce hospitalizations or mortality.
8. **Multidisciplinary team care** improves outcomes in heart failure and should be emphasized at the time of **hospital discharge**.
9. **NSAIDs** should be avoided in heart failure because they increase **blood pressure** and **worsen volume overload**.
10. **Daily weight monitoring** is important in heart failure to detect early signs of **fluid retention**.
11. **Sodium restriction (<1.5 g/day)** and **fluid restriction (1.5–2 L/day)** are often advised in heart failure but have limited evidence supporting their benefit.
12. **Cardiac rehabilitation** improves **exercise tolerance**, **functional capacity**, and **quality of life** in patients with heart failure.
13. **Clinical indicators of poor prognosis** in heart failure include **multiple hospitalizations**, **NYHA class III-IV**, **recurrent ventricular arrhythmias**, **hyponatremia**, and **worsening kidney/liver function**.
14. **Heart failure hospitalization** carries a **10–20% mortality rate** in the 6 months after discharge.
15. **Palliative care or hospice** should be considered in heart failure patients who are **ineligible for or not interested in advanced therapies**.
16. **Weight loss** and **smoking cessation** should be encouraged in patients with **chronic heart failure** as part of lifestyle modification.
17. **Alcohol** may be consumed in **moderation** in patients with **chronic heart failure**.
18. Patients with **cardiac cachexia** are at **increased risk of mortality** and represent an advanced stage of **heart failure**.
19. **Symptomatic hypotension** requiring dose reduction of **heart failure medications** is a marker of **poor prognosis**.
20. Patients requiring **loop diuretic doses >1 mg/kg** or the **addition of metolazone** often have **refractory volume overload** and **advanced heart failure**.
21. **Right ventricular dysfunction** and **pulmonary hypertension** are clinical features associated with **worse outcomes** in **heart failure**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This structured approach helps identify asymptomatic deterioration.
3. Identifying barriers to adherence (e.g., cost, cognition) improves outcomes.
4. Symptoms such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, or nocturnal awakenings may indicate sleep apnea.
5. Adaptive servoventilation increases mortality in HFrEF and is contraindicated.
6. Avoid unnecessary imaging in stable patients unless considering ICD or CRT.
8. Collaboration among specialists and caregivers prevents readmission.
9. NSAIDs antagonize the effect of diuretics and contribute to fluid retention.
10. Sudden increases in weight often precede overt decompensation.
11. Although frequently recommended, trials show mixed results for sodium/fluid restriction.
12. Benefits were confirmed in the HF-ACTION trial.
13. These markers may signal the need for referral to a heart failure specialist.
14. Prognostic discussions are essential after hospitalization.
15. Shared decision-making should address quality of life and goals of care.
16. Behavioral interventions may also enhance medication adherence and long-term functional outcomes.
17. Current guidelines do not require complete abstinence unless alcohol is a known cardiomyopathy trigger.
18. Cardiac cachexia includes unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting, and systemic inflammation.
19. Hypotension limits the up-titration of life-saving medications like ACE inhibitors and β-blockers.
20. These patients should be evaluated for referral to advanced heart failure specialists or transplant centers.
21. RV dysfunction may contribute to systemic congestion and reduced cardiac output, compounding morbidity.
