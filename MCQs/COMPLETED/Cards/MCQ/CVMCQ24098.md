### 🫠 Heart Failure: Advanced Therapies and Prognostic Markers

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **advanced heart failure** and **poor prognostic markers** should be considered for **advanced therapies**, including **heart transplantation** or **left ventricular assist device (LVAD)** placement.
2. **Heart failure hospitalization** is associated with a **mortality rate of up to 20%** during the **ensuing 6 months**.
3. Prognostic markers for **worse outcomes within 1–2 years** after heart failure diagnosis include:
   - Multiple hospitalizations
   - Poor exercise tolerance
   - **New York Heart Association (NYHA)** class III to IV
   - Recurrent ventricular arrhythmias or **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** discharges
   - Hyponatremia
   - Worsening kidney or liver function
   - **Cardiac cachexia**
   - Required **loop diuretic doses >1 mg/kg** or addition of **metolazone**
   - Symptomatic hypotension necessitating reduced dosage of heart failure medications
   - Right ventricular dysfunction
   - Pulmonary hypertension
4. A history of **cancer >5 years ago that is considered cured** is **not a contraindication** to **heart transplantation**.
5. **Valsartan–sacubitril**, a first-line therapy for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, is **contraindicated in patients with hypotension**.
6. **Transcatheter mitral valve repair** may be appropriate for **secondary mitral regurgitation** in patients with an **ejection fraction (EF) of 20% to 50%** and a **left ventricular diastolic diameter <7.5 cm**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient had recurrent heart failure hospitalizations, poor functional capacity, hyponatremia, worsening kidney function, and hypotension preventing use of guideline-directed therapy—triggering evaluation for transplant or LVAD.
3. These markers guide risk stratification and help identify candidates for advanced interventions.
4. This includes patients with prior malignancy such as breast cancer that has not recurred.
5. The patient could not tolerate **losartan** due to hypotension, suggesting intolerance to **valsartan–sacubitril** as well.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Heart failure hospitalization** is associated with a **10–20% 6-month mortality**.
2. Patients with **advanced heart failure and poor prognosis** should be referred to a **heart failure specialist** to discuss advanced therapies such as **LVAD** or **transplantation**.
3. **End-of-life care** discussions should be initiated for patients who are **ineligible for or decline advanced therapies**, and **palliative care or hospice** may be appropriate.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Prognostic data support timely referral to specialty care.
2. Specialist referral supports shared decision-making and earlier access to device or transplant evaluation.
3. Goals-of-care planning is essential in late-stage disease management.
