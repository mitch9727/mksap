### 🫠 Heart Failure: Preventing Rehospitalization

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In **hospitalized patients with heart failure**, **inpatient diuresis** should be continued until **clinical evidence of congestion** has resolved, even if symptoms have improved.
2. **Outpatient diuresis** has **not been studied** and is **not currently recommended** for patients with **heart failure** who still have signs of **volume overload**.
3. **Digoxin** can reduce **heart failure hospitalization** in patients with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** but is **not a first-line therapy** due to its **narrow therapeutic window**.
4. **Digoxin** has **not demonstrated benefit** in reducing hospitalizations in **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** and is **not indicated** in these patients.
5. **Dopamine** does **not reduce volume overload** or **prevent kidney dysfunction** in patients with **heart failure**, and clinical trials show **no benefit** in either **HFrEF** or **HFpEF**.
6. Routine switching from **furosemide** to **torsemide** at hospital discharge in patients with **heart failure** is **not recommended**, even if they are euvolemic.
7. In the **TRANSFORM-HF** study, **torsemide** did **not reduce mortality or hospitalization** compared with **furosemide** in patients discharged after **heart failure hospitalization**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient had persistent signs of volume overload (elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and weight above prior euvolemic baseline) indicating that diuresis should continue inpatient.
2. Despite theoretical convenience, outpatient diuresis lacks evidence and is not endorsed by current guidelines.
3. Digoxin is sometimes used adjunctively in HFrEF, especially when other therapies fail or atrial fibrillation coexists.
4. HFpEF lacks proven pharmacologic therapies that reduce hospitalization aside from diuretics; digoxin is not beneficial in this setting.
5. Dopamine's renal vasodilatory effects were theorized to help diuresis but have not translated to clinical outcomes.
6. Torsemide may have better oral bioavailability, but current evidence does not support changing loop diuretics routinely at discharge.
7. The TRANSFORM-HF trial was a randomized comparison of loop diuretics evaluating real-world heart failure outcomes over 12 months.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Discharge** in patients with **acute decompensated heart failure** should **not occur until euvolemia is closely approached**.
2. **Medication reconciliation** before discharge should ensure patients with **heart failure** are prescribed **mortality- and morbidity-reducing medications**.
3. **Heart failure education** covering **physiology**, **medication and dietary adherence**, **warning signs**, and **when to contact a physician** should be provided prior to discharge.
4. **Home nursing visits** after hospital discharge can reinforce **education**, confirm **medication adherence**, and assess **clinical status**.
5. **Early follow-up appointments** (within 7 days) post-discharge for **heart failure** patients are essential to reassess **volume status**, **medication adherence**, and **patient education**.
6. **Outpatient pulmonary artery pressure monitoring** reduces **rehospitalization** in patients with **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure** who were previously hospitalized.
7. **Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring** involves implanting a **wireless sensor** in the pulmonary artery and tracking **daily waveform uploads** to detect congestion early.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Residual congestion at discharge is a strong predictor of readmission in heart failure.
2. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, aldosterone antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors when appropriate.
3. Effective discharge education improves patient understanding and self-management.
4. Home nurse visits bridge the gap between hospital and clinic follow-up and support care continuity.
5. The 7-day window is a critical period during which many early decompensations occur.
6. The CHAMPION trial demonstrated the effectiveness of pulmonary artery pressure monitoring in reducing heart failure hospitalizations.
7. These sensors provide real-time data that can guide early interventions before overt decompensation.
