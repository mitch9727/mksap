### 🫀 Heart Failure: Cardiac Rehabilitation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac rehabilitation** is recommended for all patients with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** because participation in exercise programs improves **functional capacity**, **exercise duration**, and **quality of life**.
2. Participation in a **designated cardiac rehabilitation program** is preferable, but a **home exercise program** may also be beneficial if formal programs are inaccessible.
3. The **HF-ACTION trial** demonstrated that exercise training in patients with **symptomatic HFrEF** showed a trend toward improved **survival** and reduced **hospitalization**, especially in patients with risk factors such as **atrial fibrillation**, **poor exercise tolerance**, **depression**, or **lower ejection fraction (EF)**.
4. **Ivabradine** reduces heart failure hospitalizations in patients with **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III** symptoms and a **resting heart rate >70/min** despite **maximal beta-blocker therapy**.
5. **Ivabradine** is not indicated in patients with a **resting heart rate <60/min**, even if they are on beta-blockers.
6. **Routine repeat echocardiography** is not indicated in stable patients with heart failure unless there is a **change in clinical status**.
7. In **new-onset heart failure**, reassessment of **left ventricular function** after **3 months** of optimal medical therapy can help determine candidacy for **cardiac resynchronization therapy** or an **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)**.
8. **Serial measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** is not recommended for guiding therapy, as it has not been shown to reduce **hospitalizations** or **mortality** in heart failure patients.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Exercise programs are a cornerstone of nonpharmacologic management and have consistent benefits across multiple trials and guideline recommendations.
2. Home-based options are practical alternatives for patients facing geographic or financial barriers to rehab centers.
3. The **HF-ACTION** trial enrolled 2,331 patients with a mean EF of 25%, supporting robust generalizability of results in HFrEF populations.
4. Ivabradine specifically targets the **sinoatrial node** and is used only when heart rate remains elevated despite optimal beta-blockade.
5. Bradycardia is a contraindication to ivabradine due to its mechanism of **heart rate reduction**.
6. Echocardiography should be reserved for clinical changes; unnecessary imaging increases cost without benefit.
7. Devices such as **ICDs** and **CRT** (cardiac resynchronization therapy) are considered when left ventricular function remains reduced despite treatment.
8. BNP is valuable for **initial diagnosis** and **risk stratification**, but not for monitoring treatment response.
