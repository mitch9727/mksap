### 🫀 Cardiac Conduction Disorders: High-Grade Atrioventricular Block

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Permanent pacing is indicated for **symptomatic bradycardia** without a reversible cause.
2. Patients with **atrioventricular (AV) and infranodal conduction disturbances** at high risk for progression, such as **alternating bundle branch block** or **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block**, should receive a **permanent pacemaker**.
3. **Atropine** is unlikely to improve **infra-Hisian conduction** and may worsen conduction by increasing sinus rate and overloading a diseased fascicle.
4. **Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring** is not indicated if a patient already meets criteria for **pacemaker implantation**.
5. Patients with **high-degree AV block and symptoms such as syncope** should not be discharged home and require **urgent evaluation for pacemaker placement**.
6. **Low-dose β-blockers**, such as **metoprolol**, are unlikely to significantly affect **infra-Hisian conduction**, but discontinuation should occur in an **inpatient monitored setting**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This includes bradycardia from progressive conduction disease in the absence of reversible causes such as medication effects or electrolyte disturbances.
2. The patient's ECG shows intermittent 2:1 block of the left posterior fascicle on a background of right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, indicating progressive infranodal disease.
3. For example, an increased sinus rate from 80/min to 90/min may convert 2:1 conduction (pulse 40/min) to 3:1 conduction (pulse 30/min), worsening bradycardia.
4. Even though further ambulatory ECG might reveal complete heart block, the presence of high-grade block with syncope is sufficient for immediate pacemaker referral.
5. Discharging a patient with current high-grade conduction and syncope presents a risk for sudden progression to complete heart block.
6. Although metoprolol may not be the cause of the conduction delay, conservative discontinuation should occur under monitoring due to the patient’s symptoms and risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **hemodynamically significant bradycardia** should receive **atropine**.
2. **Chronotropic drug infusions**, such as **dopamine** or **epinephrine**, may be used until **temporary pacing** is implemented.
3. **Temporary transvenous pacing** is indicated for **transient causes** of **hemodynamically unstable bradycardia** or **asystole**.
4. In **hemodynamically stable patients**, **reversible and extrinsic causes** of bradycardia should be corrected before considering **permanent pacing**.
5. **Common indications for permanent pacing** include **symptomatic bradycardia without reversible cause**, **permanent atrial fibrillation with bradycardia**, **alternating bundle branch block**, **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block**, **high-degree AV block**, and **complete AV block**, regardless of symptoms.
6. Patients with stable **left bundle branch block** or **right bundle branch block**, with or without a prolonged PR interval, do not require permanent pacing due to their low progression risk (1%-3% per year).
7. **Leadless pacemakers** are used for **single-chamber ventricular pacing** in selected patients with **permanent atrial fibrillation** or **high-grade AV block** with **intact sinus node function**.
8. **Conduction system pacing** places leads in or near the **His-Purkinje system** to mimic native conduction and may yield near-normal ECG patterns.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atropine is the first-line treatment for bradycardia causing hypotension or poor perfusion.
2. Chronotropic agents serve as bridges to pacing when bradycardia is unstable and not immediately correctable.
3. Temporary pacing is typically used when a reversible insult is suspected or pacing is only needed short term.
4. Examples of reversible causes include drug effects, hypoxia, metabolic disturbances, and ischemia.
5. These conduction abnormalities are considered inherently unstable or indicative of progressive disease.
6. Bundle branch blocks alone do not usually warrant pacing unless they meet higher-risk criteria.
7. Leadless devices avoid the risks of leads and pockets but have limited pacing capabilities.
8. This technique may improve cardiac output in patients requiring ventricular pacing and avoids pacing-induced dyssynchrony.
