### 🫀 Arrhythmias: QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions in Atrial Fibrillation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Class III antiarrhythmic agents** such as **dofetilide** are associated with **QT interval prolongation** and a risk of **torsades de pointes**, particularly when combined with other QT-prolonging medications.
2. **Dofetilide** should be **discontinued** if coadministration with another QT-prolonging drug (e.g., **methadone**) is necessary.
3. **Methadone** prolongs the QT interval and is **contraindicated** with other QT-prolonging medications such as dofetilide and sotalol.
4. **Sotalol**, like dofetilide, is a **class III antiarrhythmic** and should also not be used concurrently with methadone due to additive QT-prolonging effects.
5. **Metoprolol** does not significantly prolong the QT interval and is not contraindicated in the setting of QT prolongation.
6. The **Bazett formula** (QTc = QT / √RR) may **undercorrect** the QT interval at heart rates below 60/min, particularly in bradycardia.
7. Class III antiarrhythmics are typically initiated in the **inpatient setting** with **QT interval monitoring** due to their proarrhythmic potential.
8. Other QT-prolonging medications include **macrolide antibiotics**, **fluoroquinolones**, **antipsychotics**, **methadone**, and some **antidepressants**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. This patient with life-threatening opioid use disorder requires methadone, making discontinuation of dofetilide the safer option.
3. Methadone is often essential in opioid use disorder but demands caution in cardiac patients due to QT risk.
6. Bradycardia affects QT correction and complicates interpretation of QTc in clinical decisions.
7. Inpatient initiation helps detect early QT prolongation and reduce risk of torsades de pointes.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Antiarrhythmic agents** are classified using the **Vaughan-Williams classification system**, based on their primary mechanism of action.
2. **Class I and class III antiarrhythmics** are highly effective but carry a **risk of inducing arrhythmias**.
3. **Flecainide** and **propafenone** (class IC agents) are contraindicated in patients with **structural or ischemic heart disease** due to risk of ventricular arrhythmias and death.
4. **Class II** (β-blockers) and **class IV** (nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) are used to inhibit **atrioventricular (AV) conduction** and control rate in atrial arrhythmias.
5. **Dofetilide** and **sotalol**, both **class III agents**, require **inpatient initiation** and **QT monitoring**.
6. **Amiodarone** is a multichannel blocker used in recurrent ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation with **systemic toxicities** including **thyroid**, **liver**, **pulmonary**, **ocular**, and **neurologic** effects.
7. **Amiodarone** interacts with many drugs, including **warfarin**, **statins**, and **digoxin**.
8. **Digoxin** and **adenosine** are not part of the Vaughan-Williams classification but are used for **rate control** or to **interrupt AV conduction**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. The paradoxical proarrhythmic risk of membrane-active drugs requires careful monitoring.
5. QT prolongation is a primary safety concern in the initiation of class III agents like dofetilide.
6. Monitoring protocols for amiodarone include liver/thyroid function (every 6 months), and annual pulmonary/eye exams.
8. Digoxin increases vagal tone; adenosine provides rapid AV node blockade for supraventricular tachycardia.
