### 🫀 Cardiac Electrophysiology: Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome** is defined by **symptomatic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)** with **evidence of preexcitation on resting electrocardiogram (ECG)**.
2. **Preexcitation on ECG** is demonstrated by a **shortened PR interval** and **slurring of the initial part of the QRS complex (delta wave)**.
3. Potential symptoms of **WPW syndrome** include **palpitations**, **presyncope**, and **syncope**.
4. **Atrial fibrillation (AF)** occurs in up to **one third of patients with WPW syndrome**.
5. In less than **1% of patients with WPW syndrome**, **rapid conduction over an accessory pathway during AF** may cause **ventricular fibrillation** and **sudden cardiac death**.
6. **Electrophysiology study** is commonly performed in WPW syndrome for both **risk stratification** and **curative ablation**.
7. **Catheter ablation** is **first-line therapy** for patients with WPW syndrome.
8. **Antiarrhythmic therapy** is **second-line therapy** for WPW syndrome.
9. **Genetic testing** does not have a role in the management of WPW syndrome.
10. **Amiodarone** is rarely used in young, healthy patients because of its **toxicity**, despite its antiarrhythmic efficacy.
11. **Reassurance** is not an appropriate strategy in patients with **syncope** and **preexcitation on ECG**, as these features warrant further evaluation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. AVRT involves reentry through an accessory pathway that bypasses the atrioventricular node.
2. The delta wave reflects early ventricular activation through the accessory pathway.
3. These symptoms result from episodic supraventricular tachycardia due to accessory pathway conduction.
4. AF in WPW is clinically important due to the risk of rapid ventricular response.
5. This risk underlies the need for risk stratification and definitive therapy in WPW syndrome.
6. Although exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring may be used, electrophysiology testing is more definitive.
7. The high success rate of catheter ablation makes it the preferred treatment in symptomatic WPW.
8. Antiarrhythmic drugs may be considered when ablation is not feasible or unsuccessful.
9. Genetic testing may be appropriate for other inherited arrhythmogenic conditions but not for WPW.
10. Amiodarone has numerous systemic toxicities including pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction, and liver injury.
11. Even asymptomatic individuals with preexcitation may require evaluation depending on clinical context (e.g., high-risk occupations).

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)** is an accessory pathway–mediated tachycardia often associated with **preexcitation (delta wave)** on electrocardiogram (ECG).
2. **Orthodromic AVRT** (anterograde conduction over the atrioventricular node) accounts for **90% to 95%** of AVRT cases and is associated with a **narrow QRS complex**.
3. **Antidromic AVRT** (anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway) accounts for the remaining cases and results in a **wide QRS complex**.
4. **Rapid conduction over an accessory pathway in atrial fibrillation (AF)** can cause **ventricular fibrillation (VF)** and **sudden cardiac death (SCD)** in WPW syndrome.
5. The **success rate for catheter ablation** in WPW syndrome is **high**, though it depends on the **location of the accessory pathway**.
6. In **asymptomatic patients** with preexcitation, invasive testing is typically reserved for those with **high-risk occupations**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Delta waves reflect early ventricular activation through the accessory pathway before normal atrioventricular conduction.
2. Orthodromic conduction produces a narrow-complex tachycardia as the impulse travels down the AV node and back up the accessory pathway.
3. Antidromic conduction produces a wide-complex tachycardia as the impulse travels anterogradely down the accessory pathway.
4. This risk is the basis for recommending curative therapy even in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients in selected cases.
5. Certain accessory pathway locations, such as septal or mid-septal pathways, may pose greater technical challenges.
6. Examples of high-risk occupations include commercial airline pilots and military personnel.
