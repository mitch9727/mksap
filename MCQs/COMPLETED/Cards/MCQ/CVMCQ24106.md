### 🫠 Cardiology: Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation with Bleeding Risk

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)** is an appropriate treatment option in patients with **atrial fibrillation (AF)** who have **high risk for both stroke and bleeding**.
2. **Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)** may be considered in patients with **atrial fibrillation (AF)** and a **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥3** who cannot take long-term **oral anticoagulation**.
3. **Percutaneous LAAO** involves implantation of a **self-expanding device**, while **surgical closure** is another occlusion method.
4. Patients undergoing **LAAO** typically require **short-term oral anticoagulation** post-procedure and **long-term antiplatelet therapy**.
5. **Patients considered for LAAO** must be able to tolerate **short-term oral anticoagulation** and **long-term antiplatelet therapy**.
6. **Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF)** is not indicated to reduce **stroke risk** and does **not eliminate the need for anticoagulation**.
7. **Antiplatelet therapy** (e.g., **clopidogrel**) is **not effective** for stroke prevention in **atrial fibrillation** and carries significant **bleeding risk**.
8. There is **no evidence** that **rivaroxaban** is safer than **apixaban** in terms of **bleeding risk**; in fact, **rivaroxaban** has **higher gastrointestinal bleeding risk**.
9. **Withholding all stroke prevention therapies** is inappropriate in patients with **atrial fibrillation** and **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 5**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. LAAO is often used when oral anticoagulation is contraindicated due to bleeding risk, as in colonic angiodysplasia or prior major bleeding.
2. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score includes factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke history, and vascular disease.
4. Short-term anticoagulation helps the implanted device endothelialize and prevent thrombus formation.
5. Long-term antiplatelet therapy is needed to prevent thromboembolism post-device placement.
6. Catheter ablation addresses rhythm control but does not lower embolic risk.
7. Antiplatelet agents are inferior to anticoagulants in stroke prevention and may still cause bleeding.
8. Rivaroxaban’s pharmacokinetics make it more dependent on renal function than apixaban.
9. A CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 5 indicates a high annual stroke risk (>6%).

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)** is a nonpharmacologic strategy to prevent **stroke and systemic thromboembolism** in patients with **atrial fibrillation (AF)** and **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥3**.
2. **Left atrial appendage occlusion** may be performed **percutaneously** using a **self-expanding device** or through **surgical closure**.
3. Most patients undergoing **percutaneous LAAO** require **short-term oral anticoagulation** during **device endothelialization**, followed by **long-term antiplatelet therapy**.
4. **Residual leak** or **device-related thrombus** can occur after **LAAO**, posing ongoing risk for **thromboembolism**.
5. There is **no standardized protocol** for **routine postprocedure imaging surveillance** after **LAAO**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. LAAO is considered in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation due to bleeding.
2. Options include the Watchman and Amulet devices for percutaneous LAAO.
3. Anticoagulation is often required for 45 days post-implantation.
4. Residual peridevice flow or thrombus formation can reduce procedural effectiveness.
5. Follow-up imaging is performed at physician discretion, typically via transesophageal echocardiography.
