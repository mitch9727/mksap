### 🫠 Arrhythmia: Supraventricular Tachycardia (AVNRT) Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)** is the most common form of **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)** exclusive of **atrial fibrillation (AF)** and **atrial flutter (AFL)**, accounting for approximately two thirds of SVT cases.
2. **AVNRT** is produced by a **reentrant circuit within the atrioventricular (AV) node** that alternates between a **fast** and a **slow** conduction pathway.
3. The characteristic electrocardiographic pattern of **AVNRT** is a **short RP interval** with a **retrograde P wave** located immediately after, or buried within, the **QRS complex**.
4. **Vagal maneuvers** (for example, coughing or bearing down) are the **first‑line therapy** for terminating acute symptomatic **AVNRT**.
5. When vagal maneuvers are ineffective, a **rapid intravenous bolus of adenosine** is usually effective for terminating **SVT** due to **AVNRT**.
6. Acute symptomatic **SVT** that persists despite vagal maneuvers and adenosine should be treated with **synchronized direct‑current cardioversion** or an **intravenous atrioventricular nodal‑blocking agent** such as **verapamil**.
7. **Hemodynamic instability** in **AVNRT** (for example, hypotension, syncope, or ischemia) requires immediate **synchronized direct‑current cardioversion**.
8. **Intravenous β‑blockers** such as **metoprolol** have limited efficacy for acute termination of **AVNRT** but can be used for **long‑term prevention** of recurrent episodes.
9. **Catheter ablation** of the AV nodal slow pathway provides a **high (>95%) cure rate** for **AVNRT** but carries a small (<1%) risk of permanent **AV node injury** necessitating pacemaker implantation.
10. **Anticoagulation** is **not indicated** for **AVNRT** but is required for **AF** or **AFL** when the **CHA₂DS₂‑VASc** stroke‑risk score meets guideline thresholds.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This prevalence figure excludes supraventricular tachycardias caused by **AF** and **AFL**, which have different mechanisms and management strategies.
2. The **slow pathway** has a shorter refractory period, allowing the reentrant loop to circulate when premature atrial beats occur.
3. Recognizing a **short RP interval** helps differentiate **AVNRT** from **atrial flutter** and **atrial tachycardia**.
4. Vagal maneuvers transiently **increase parasympathetic (vagal) tone**, slowing AV nodal conduction and interrupting the reentrant circuit.
5. **Adenosine** transiently blocks AV nodal conduction, producing a brief asystole that stops the reentry; side effects include flushing and chest pressure.
6. **Verapamil** and **synchronized cardioversion** are considered **second‑line** when adenosine fails or is contraindicated.
7. Signs of instability include **systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg**, **angina**, or **altered mental status**.
8. Oral β‑blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can prevent recurrences in patients who decline or are unsuitable for ablation.
9. Slow‑pathway modification preserves the fast pathway, minimizing complete AV block risk.
10. **CHA₂DS₂‑VASc** stands for **Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years (2 points), Diabetes mellitus, Stroke/TIA/systemic embolism (2 points), Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category female**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrioventricular nodal‑blocking drugs**—including **β‑blockers** and **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**—are used to **prevent recurrent episodes of AVNRT** in patients managed medically.
2. **Catheter ablation** is frequently selected as **first‑line therapy** for **AVNRT** in patients who do not tolerate or wish to avoid long‑term pharmacologic therapy.
3. **Slow‑pathway modification** during catheter ablation achieves a procedural success rate **greater than 95%** for **AVNRT**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Chronic pharmacologic suppression is less effective than ablation and may be limited by adverse effects such as fatigue or hypotension.
2. Patient preference, comorbid conditions, and local expertise influence the initial choice between ablation and medication.
3. Procedural success is defined as the **non‑inducibility** of AVNRT with programmed electrical stimulation at the end of the procedure.
