### 🫀 Cardiac Conduction: Nocturnal Bradycardia and Sleep Apnea

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Sinus bradycardia** is defined as sinus rhythm with a heart rate below 50/min.
2. **Isolated nocturnal bradyarrhythmias and heart block** during sleep generally do not require intervention beyond investigating secondary causes.
3. In patients with **nocturnal bradycardia or conduction disturbances**, **sleep apnea** should be considered and, if appropriate, evaluated and treated.
4. **Mobitz type 1 heart block** has a low likelihood of progressing to high-grade block and typically does not require **pacemaker implantation**.
5. **Exercise stress testing** is not necessary in patients who have demonstrated **chronotropic competence** and have no ischemic symptoms or risk factors.
6. **Permanent pacemaker placement** should not be considered until treatable causes of bradycardia, such as sleep apnea, are evaluated.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Sinus bradycardia may be normal in trained athletes and during sleep.
3. Sleep apnea may cause high vagal tone at night, leading to nocturnal heart block such as Mobitz type 1.
5. Chronotropic competence was confirmed by ambulatory monitoring with a maximum heart rate of 140/min.
6. Evaluation for treatable causes like sleep apnea should precede any consideration of device therapy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bradycardia** (heart rate <50/min) may be asymptomatic or cause light-headedness, syncope, exertional intolerance, dyspnea, or fatigue.
2. Diagnostic evaluation for bradycardia includes **history**, **physical examination**, **electrolyte levels**, **thyroid function testing**, and a **12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)**.
3. Reversible causes of bradycardia include **ischemia**, **myocarditis**, **endocarditis**, **hypothyroidism**, **infections**, **neurologic events**, **electrolyte abnormalities**, and **medications** (especially atrioventricular nodal blockers and parasympathomimetics).
4. **Atrioventricular nodal blockers**, such as β-blockers, commonly cause **sinus bradycardia** and block at or above the AV node, but rarely cause infranodal block.
5. **Echocardiography**, **exercise stress testing**, and **ambulatory ECG monitoring** may assist in evaluating bradycardia.
6. In patients with **nocturnal bradycardia or conduction disturbances**, **sleep apnea** should be evaluated and treated when appropriate.
7. Isolated **asymptomatic bradyarrhythmias during sleep** are unlikely to require **permanent pacemaker implantation**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. A comprehensive diagnostic approach helps distinguish intrinsic conduction system disease from reversible extrinsic causes.
4. Infranodal block, such as complete heart block, typically has different etiologies than AV nodal blocker effects.
5. Testing should be directed by symptoms and findings from history or physical exam.
