### 🫀 Cardiology: Symptomatic Premature Atrial Contractions and Atrial Tachycardia Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Symptomatic atrial ectopy**, including **premature atrial contractions (PACs)** and **brief atrial tachycardia**, is typically treated with an **atrioventricular node–blocking β‑blocker** such as **metoprolol**.
2. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** (for example, **diltiazem** or **verapamil**) are an alternative pharmacologic option for treating **symptomatic PACs and atrial tachycardia**.
3. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are early isolated supraventricular beats that are detected in **≈99 % of adults** on **ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring**.
4. **Atrial tachycardia** is a regular supraventricular tachycardia originating from an atrial focus outside the **sinoatrial node** and may occur with or without **structural heart disease**.
5. Both **PACs** and **atrial tachycardia** are usually hemodynamically tolerated but can cause subjective **palpitations** and other bothersome symptoms.
6. A **high PAC burden** is associated with an increased future risk of developing **atrial fibrillation**, yet **oral anticoagulation** is **not indicated** for isolated PACs or atrial tachycardia in the absence of atrial fibrillation.
7. **Catheter ablation** for **atrial tachycardia** is effective in patients with **persistent, drug‑refractory arrhythmia**, but electro‑anatomic mapping can be challenging when ectopy is infrequent.
8. Patients with **minimal or no symptoms** from **PACs** or **atrial tachycardia** may reasonably choose **no pharmacologic therapy** after shared decision‑making.

#### 💬 Extra
1. β‑Blockers slow **atrioventricular nodal conduction**, reduce ectopic automaticity, and blunt adrenergic stimulation that can trigger atrial ectopy.
2. Calcium channel blockers exert similar rate‑controlling effects through **L‑type calcium‑channel blockade**, providing an option when β‑blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated.
3. The ubiquitous presence of PACs underscores that treatment is indicated only when symptoms are bothersome or when ectopy triggers more serious arrhythmias.
4. Recognition that atrial tachycardia can be idiopathic or related to conditions such as **hypertension** or **obstructive sleep apnea** guides evaluation for reversible factors.
6. Decisions regarding anticoagulation in atrial arrhythmias are driven by the presence of sustained **atrial fibrillation** and validated stroke‑risk scores (for example, **CHA₂DS₂‑VASc**), not by isolated PACs.
7. Procedural success of ablation depends on reliably inducing or capturing the arrhythmia for high‑density mapping, which is less feasible when ectopy is sporadic.
8. Medication side effects (for example, fatigue or bradycardia with β‑blockers) should be weighed against symptomatic benefit in otherwise benign atrial ectopy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are early, isolated atrial beats that are **exceedingly common** and increase in frequency with **age**.
2. **High PAC burden** is associated with increased risk for **atrial fibrillation (AF)**.
3. **Symptomatic PACs** are typically treated with **β-blockers** or **calcium channel blockers**.
4. **Atrial tachycardia** originates from an **atrial site other than the sinus node** and has a rate **greater than 100/min**.
5. **First-line treatment** for **symptomatic atrial tachycardia** includes **β-blockers** or **calcium channel blockers**.
6. **Second-line treatments** for atrial tachycardia include **catheter ablation** or **antiarrhythmic drug therapy**.
7. **Catheter ablation success rates** are generally **lower in atrial tachycardia** compared to other **supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs)**.
8. **Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)** is characterized by **three or more P-wave morphologies** and a **heart rate >100/min**.
9. MAT is usually seen in patients with **severe pulmonary disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Only 1% of individuals monitored via ambulatory ECG have no PACs.
2. PAC burden has prognostic implications for **AF development**.
3. Medication choice depends on **symptom severity** and comorbid conditions.
4. Atrial tachycardia may be **paroxysmal** or **sustained**, with or without **structural heart disease**.
5. Rate control is typically **sufficient for symptom management** in atrial tachycardia.
6. Catheter ablation is reserved for **refractory or intolerant cases**.
7. This may reflect the **diffuse atrial foci** and **non-reentrant mechanisms** of atrial tachycardia.
8. P-wave variability is essential to distinguish MAT from other **irregular rhythms**.
9. Severe pulmonary disease includes conditions like **COPD**, **asthma**, or **hypoxia**.
