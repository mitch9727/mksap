### 🫠 Atrial Fibrillation: Catheter Ablation in HFrEF

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial fibrillation (AF)** complicates nearly **40% of heart failure cases**, and this combination significantly worsens clinical outcomes.
2. **Aggressive rhythm control** in patients with **atrial fibrillation and heart failure** may **reduce morbidity and mortality**.
3. In patients with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, **catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation** is associated with **improved outcomes** compared with medical therapy.
4. **Flecainide** is contraindicated in patients with **structural or ischemic heart disease**, despite its efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm in structurally normal hearts.
5. **Sotalol** is contraindicated in patients with **impaired left ventricular function**, such as those with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
6. **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** placement for **primary prevention** in **ischemic heart failure** is indicated for patients with **ejection fraction <30%** and does not apply if the ejection fraction is possibly reversible due to AF.
7. **Amiodarone** may be useful for **rhythm control** in patients with **paroxysmal atrial fibrillation**, but its **long-term use is discouraged in younger patients** due to significant toxicity risks.

#### 💬 Extra
3. In this patient, prior rhythm control with **amiodarone** was associated with improved heart failure symptoms, supporting the decision to pursue **catheter ablation**.
6. This patient's reduced ejection fraction may improve if atrial fibrillation is treated, and there is no indication for pacing at present.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial fibrillation (AF)** complicates approximately **40% of heart failure cases**, and its coexistence with heart failure significantly worsens clinical outcomes.
2. **Rhythm control** strategies in patients with **atrial fibrillation and heart failure** have been shown to **reduce both morbidity and mortality** in multiple clinical trials.
3. In patients with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, **catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation** provides **greater morbidity and mortality benefit** than medical therapy.
4. **Patient selection** is important when considering **catheter ablation** in patients with **heart failure**, due to the need to balance **periprocedural risk** against **expected benefit**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The burden of atrial fibrillation in heart failure necessitates consideration of rhythm control, especially when symptoms or decompensation are driven by arrhythmia.
2. This benefit is particularly evident in patients whose heart failure is worsened by atrial fibrillation.
3. Trials such as CASTLE-AF and others have demonstrated improved outcomes, including reduced hospitalization and death.
4. Although procedural risks of catheter ablation are low, the benefit may be diminished in patients with very advanced heart failure or comorbidities.
