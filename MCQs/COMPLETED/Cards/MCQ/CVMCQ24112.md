### 🫠 Heart Failure: Cardiac Resynchronization and ICD Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)** reduce the risk of **sudden cardiac death** in patients with **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
2. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** improves outcomes in patients with **HFrEF** and **interventricular conduction delays**, especially when combined with **ICD placement**.
3. Indications for **ICD placement** include **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%** (or ≤30% in **ischemic cardiomyopathy**) and **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III** symptoms.
4. Indications for **CRT** include **LVEF ≤35%**, **NYHA class II–IV** symptoms, **sinus rhythm**, and **evidence of electrical dyssynchrony** (e.g., **left bundle branch block [LBBB]** with **QRS ≥120 ms**, or **non-LBBB** with **QRS >150 ms**).
5. **Prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy** with drugs such as **amiodarone** is not indicated in HFrEF unless there is another compelling reason.
6. **Ivabradine** is indicated in **symptomatic HFrEF** with **sinus rhythm**, **heart rate ≥70/min**, and after **maximal β-blocker therapy**; it is not appropriate if heart rate is <70/min.
7. Patients meeting criteria for both **ICD placement** and **CRT** should undergo **combined biventricular pacing and ICD implantation**.
8. Patients with HFrEF and no comorbid conditions that limit longevity should be considered for **device therapy** if guideline-based criteria are met.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ICDs have demonstrated mortality benefit in primary prevention of sudden death in appropriately selected patients with reduced LVEF.
2. CRT improves ventricular synchrony, leading to enhanced cardiac output and reverse remodeling in patients with wide QRS complexes.
4. CRT response is highest in patients with LBBB morphology and QRS duration ≥150 ms; non-LBBB patterns may benefit only if QRS is very prolonged.
5. Isolated premature ventricular contractions are not an indication for antiarrhythmic treatment unless frequent or symptomatic.
6. Ivabradine acts as a sinoatrial node modulator and should not be initiated if heart rate is already controlled.
7. CRT combined with ICD is standard for eligible patients to address both arrhythmic and mechanical dysfunction.
8. Device therapy is appropriate only when the patient is receiving **maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy** and has a life expectancy of **at least 1 year**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)** are indicated for **secondary prevention** of sudden cardiac death in patients with **sustained ventricular arrhythmias >30 seconds** or **cardiac arrest without a reversible cause**.
2. **ICDs** are recommended for **primary prevention** of sudden cardiac death in patients with **ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy**, **LVEF <35%**, and **NYHA class II or III heart failure**.
3. Patients with **heart failure and interventricular conduction defects**, especially **left bundle branch block**, often benefit from **cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** in combination with **ICD**.
4. **Subcutaneous ICDs** offer an alternative to transvenous systems and reduce the risk of **device-related infection**.
5. **Inappropriate shocks** from ICD malfunction (e.g., lead failure) can be temporarily suppressed by placing a **donut magnet** over the device, which **disables defibrillator therapies** but maintains **bradycardia pacing**.
6. For patients with **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms**, **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** placement is indicated **≥40 days after myocardial infarction (MI)** if **ejection fraction (EF) ≤30%**.
7. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** is **not indicated** in patients with **NYHA class I heart failure symptoms**, regardless of EF or conduction findings.
8. In **NYHA class II, III, or IV heart failure**, CRT is indicated when **EF ≤35%**, the patient is in **sinus rhythm**, and there is **left bundle branch block (LBBB)** with a **QRS duration ≥150 milliseconds**.
9. **ICD placement** is indicated in **NYHA class II and III heart failure** with **EF ≤35%**.
10. **ICD therapy** in **NYHA class IV** is restricted to patients who are being **actively considered for heart transplantation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This is a **class I recommendation** for secondary prevention, targeting survivors of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
2. This expands ICD indications beyond symptomatic patients to include those at high risk for sudden death despite stable rhythm.
3. CRT restores synchrony and improves outcomes in appropriately selected patients with conduction abnormalities.
4. Subcutaneous systems avoid vascular access and are increasingly used in younger patients or those at high infection risk.
5. Magnet use is a standard emergency protocol for terminating inappropriate shocks until device interrogation is possible.
6. The 40-day post-MI window allows for potential recovery of systolic function before ICD implantation is considered.
7. Patients with NYHA class I have asymptomatic systolic dysfunction and generally do not benefit from CRT, even with LBBB.
8. CRT criteria are strict and benefit is clearest in those with LBBB morphology and wide QRS; this is consistent across class II–IV symptoms.
9. EF threshold for primary prevention ICD therapy is lower in ischemic cardiomyopathy (≤30%), but ≤35% applies for general guideline criteria.
10. ICD use in NYHA class IV is generally avoided unless the patient is a transplant candidate due to poor prognosis and limited survival benefit.

<p><em>
CRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; EF = ejection fraction; ICD = implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; LBBB = left bundle branch block; MI = myocardial infarction; NYHA = New York Heart Association.<br>
<sup>a</sup>All patients should be receiving maximally tolerated heart failure medications and have an anticipated survival of at least 1 year.<br>
<sup>b</sup>After MI, a waiting period of at least 40 days is required; for nonischemic myocardial injury, the waiting period is usually at least 3 months.
