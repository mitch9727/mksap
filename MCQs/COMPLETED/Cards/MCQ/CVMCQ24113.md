### ⚡ Arrhythmia: Management of Ventricular Tachycardia Arrest

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is a **wide-complex tachycardia** with a **QRS duration ≥120 ms**, and it is usually monomorphic.
2. In adult patients with known **structural heart disease**, approximately **95% of wide-complex tachycardias** are **ventricular tachycardia**.
3. Patients with **ventricular tachycardia and hemodynamic instability** should undergo **immediate direct current cardioversion**.
4. In patients with **cardiac arrest and a shockable rhythm** (e.g., VT or ventricular fibrillation), **defibrillation should occur as soon as possible**.
5. **Time to defibrillation** is a key determinant of the **likelihood of survival to hospital discharge** in cardiac arrest.
6. **Amiodarone** is indicated for **refractory ventricular arrhythmias** during resuscitation but is **less effective than defibrillation** for immediate rhythm conversion.
7. **Chest compressions** are indicated for **unwitnessed arrests** or for **witnessed arrests without a shockable rhythm**, not as the first step in witnessed VT arrest.
8. **Cardiac catheterization** may be performed after VT arrest to assess for **acute coronary syndrome**, but **defibrillation takes precedence** in urgent management.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Other causes of wide-complex tachycardia include **supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction**, **pre-excited (antidromic) tachycardia**, and **ventricular-paced rhythms**.
2. Given the high prevalence of VT in structural heart disease, **additional ECG criteria** are often unnecessary for diagnosis.
3. **Loss of consciousness** is a sign of instability necessitating cardioversion.
4. The urgency of defibrillation stems from its role in rapidly restoring **normal sinus rhythm**.
5. Delays in defibrillation are associated with **lower survival rates**.
6. Amiodarone may be given by **intravenous bolus** in cardiac arrest scenarios.
7. This patient had a **witnessed arrest with wide-complex tachycardia**, confirming a **shockable rhythm** requiring immediate defibrillation.
8. **Cardiac catheterization** is often pursued after stabilization, particularly in suspected **acute coronary syndrome**, which is a common cause of arrest.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac arrest** requires **immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)** and **advanced cardiac life support**.
2. **Interruptions in chest compressions** should be minimized during cardiac arrest management.
3. **Defibrillation should occur as soon as possible** in patients with a **shockable rhythm**.
4. The **presence or absence of a shockable rhythm** guides management after initiation of CPR.
5. In **out-of-hospital cardiac arrest**, **early cardiac catheterization** helps identify causes of arrest and facilitates **early intervention**.
6. Communities with **more automatic external defibrillators (AEDs)** and greater **basic life support (BLS) training** have better **cardiac arrest outcomes**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. CPR and ACLS improve survival if begun without delay.
2. Minimizing compression pauses helps maintain coronary perfusion pressure.
3. Defibrillation is the only effective treatment for rhythms like **ventricular fibrillation** and **pulseless VT**.
4. Rhythm analysis determines whether immediate shock or ongoing CPR is indicated.
5. Coronary artery disease is a frequent cause of sudden cardiac arrest.
6. Bystander AED use and BLS reduce time to first shock and improve survival rates.
