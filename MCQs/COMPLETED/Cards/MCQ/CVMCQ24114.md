### 🫀 Arrhythmias: Contraindications to Class IC Antiarrhythmics

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs**, such as **propafenone** and **flecainide**, are **contraindicated** in patients with **structural heart disease** or **ischemic heart disease** due to the increased risk of **life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias**.
2. **Propafenone** and **flecainide** are used as part of a **rhythm control strategy** in **atrial fibrillation** but should be avoided in patients with **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
3. Other **contraindications** to class IC agents include **sinus node dysfunction**, **second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block**, and **bundle branch disease without a pacemaker**.
4. If a rhythm control strategy is desired in patients with **CAD**, alternative antiarrhythmic agents or **catheter ablation** may be considered.
5. The combination of **dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** and **oral anticoagulation** (so-called **triple therapy**) significantly increases the risk of **bleeding**.
6. In patients with a **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1** (due to CAD alone), **oral anticoagulation** is not widely recommended.
7. **Verapamil**, a **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker**, is a **rate control agent** in atrial fibrillation but may cause **symptomatic bradycardia** if added to **β-blockers** like **metoprolol**.
8. Patients with **newly diagnosed CAD** who are taking **propafenone** for atrial fibrillation should have the drug **discontinued**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias stems from the membrane-active effects of class IC drugs in the setting of myocardial scarring or ischemia.
2. Propafenone is effective for rhythm control in structurally normal hearts but becomes unsafe after a CAD diagnosis.
3. AV conduction system disease may be worsened by sodium channel blockade in the absence of pacing support.
4. Drugs such as **amiodarone**, **dofetilide**, or **sotalol** may be preferred in CAD; catheter ablation is another rhythm control option.
5. DAPT typically includes **aspirin** and a **P2Y12 inhibitor**; adding an anticoagulant increases gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding risks.
6. A CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 in a man (e.g., for vascular disease) typically does not justify anticoagulation in current guidelines.
7. Verapamil has negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, and its use with β-blockers should be avoided if resting heart rate is already low.
8. Discontinuing propafenone is necessary even if it previously controlled atrial fibrillation symptoms.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Flecainide** and **propafenone** are **class IC antiarrhythmic drugs** used primarily to treat **atrial arrhythmias**.
2. Class IC agents are typically used with **atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockers** to prevent **1:1 atrial flutter** conduction.
3. **Toxicity** from class IC agents may manifest as **QRS widening** on electrocardiogram (ECG).
4. **Class IC agents** are **contraindicated** in patients with **ischemic or structural heart disease** due to risk of **ventricular arrhythmias and death**.
5. **Class II agents** (β-blockers) and **class IV agents** (nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) are used to **inhibit AV conduction** in **supraventricular or atrial arrhythmias**.
6. **Class III agents** such as **sotalol** and **dofetilide** are used to treat **atrial and ventricular arrhythmias** but may cause **QT prolongation**, necessitating **inpatient initiation and QT monitoring**.
7. **Amiodarone**, a **multichannel blocker**, has a **low risk of proarrhythmia** but is associated with **thyroid, liver, lung, eye, and neurologic toxicities**.
8. **Amiodarone** requires **thyroid and liver function tests every 6 months** and **pulmonary and ophthalmologic evaluations annually**.
9. **Amiodarone** interacts with drugs such as **warfarin**, **statins**, and **digoxin**.
10. **Dronedarone** may be used in **paroxysmal atrial fibrillation** in patients without **overt heart failure**.
11. **Digoxin** is not included in the Vaughan-Williams classification but is used for **rate control in atrial fibrillation** via **vagal stimulation**.
12. **Adenosine** is used to **interrupt AV conduction** and terminate **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)** due to its **rapid onset and metabolism**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Class IC agents act on sodium channels and are highly effective in atrial fibrillation when no structural abnormalities are present.
2. AV nodal blockers reduce the risk of organized flutter converting to rapid ventricular response.
3. ECG monitoring is necessary to detect proarrhythmic effects, especially with dose titration.
4. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) showed harm from class IC drugs in patients with myocardial infarction.
5. These agents are preferred for rate control in atrial fibrillation or flutter when rhythm control is not feasible or desired.
6. Inpatient initiation mitigates the risk of torsades de pointes from excessive QT prolongation.
7. Systemic toxicities of amiodarone limit its use as first-line therapy, especially in younger patients.
8. These monitoring recommendations align with guideline-based toxicity surveillance.
9. Drug interactions necessitate dose adjustment and close INR monitoring when used with warfarin.
10. Dronedarone is structurally related to amiodarone but less toxic and less effective.
11. Digoxin slows AV nodal conduction but does not convert rhythm to sinus.
12. Adenosine can transiently block AV node to expose underlying atrial rhythm or terminate AV nodal reentry tachycardia.
