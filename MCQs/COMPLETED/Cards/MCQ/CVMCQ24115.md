### 🫀 Atrial Fibrillation: Initial Rate Control

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **β-blockers** and **nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** are first-line agents for ventricular rate control in **atrial fibrillation (AF)**.
2. **Metoprolol**, a β-blocker, is appropriate for initial rate control in AF, especially in patients with **chronic kidney disease** or **left ventricular (LV) dysfunction**.
3. **Digoxin** is a second-line agent for rate control in AF and is typically used as **add-on therapy** when β-blockers or calcium channel blockers are insufficient.
4. **Direct current cardioversion (DCCV)** is reserved for **unstable patients**, those with a known AF duration of less than 48 hours, or those who have received **adequate anticoagulation**.
5. In **stable patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)** of unknown or prolonged duration, at least **4 weeks of anticoagulation** or **imaging to exclude left atrial thrombus** is required before cardioversion.
6. **Uncontrolled AF with rapid ventricular rate**, even in asymptomatic patients, poses a risk for **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**, necessitating rate control.
7. Target heart rate in AF management is between **60/min and 110/min** to prevent complications and alleviate symptoms.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The choice between β-blockers and calcium channel blockers depends on comorbid conditions; for example, calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with **LV dysfunction**.
2. **Digoxin toxicity** is more common in patients with **impaired renal function**, making it less favorable as a first-line agent in such populations.
4. Cardioversion without prior anticoagulation is contraindicated due to the risk of **thromboembolism**, unless a **left atrial thrombus** is ruled out by imaging.
