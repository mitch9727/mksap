### 🫀 Atrial Fibrillation: Stroke Prevention Post-Ablation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Oral anticoagulation** is indicated for stroke prevention in patients with **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF)** based on **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score**.
2. The **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score** assigns points for **age ≥75 (2 points)**, **female sex**, **hypertension**, and **diabetes**; a total score ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women warrants anticoagulation.
3. **Catheter ablation** for atrial fibrillation improves symptom control but has **not been shown to reduce stroke risk**, especially in patients at high baseline risk.
4. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** such as **apixaban** should be continued in patients with high stroke risk despite ablation.
5. **Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)** is an alternative to anticoagulation only if **oral anticoagulation is not feasible**.
6. Combining **antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin)** with oral anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and is **not recommended** unless there is another clear indication (e.g., recent stenting or stroke).

#### 💬 Extra
1. Guidelines from the **American College of Cardiology (ACC)**, **American Heart Association (AHA)**, and **Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)** recommend anticoagulation based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores, with more flexibility now given to consider other factors like chronic kidney disease or arrhythmia burden.
2. This patient's **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 5** reflects high stroke risk: **2 points for age ≥75**, **1 point for hypertension**, **1 for diabetes**, and **1 for female sex**.
3. Discontinuing apixaban post-ablation would be inappropriate given her high stroke risk and lack of contraindications to anticoagulation.
