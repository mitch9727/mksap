### 🫠 Cardiology: Catheter Ablation for Atrial Flutter

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **rhythm control strategy** is preferred over rate control in **typical atrial flutter** because achieving adequate rate control often requires high doses of multiple **atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents**.
2. **Catheter ablation** of the cavotricuspid isthmus in typical atrial flutter is **routinely curative**, with a **>95% success rate** and an excellent safety profile, and is recommended as the **preferred first‑line rhythm‑control therapy**.
3. The class III antiarrhythmic **amiodarone** is **often ineffective** for maintaining sinus rhythm in atrial flutter and is limited by **thyroid, hepatic, and pulmonary toxicity**.
4. Repeat **direct current cardioversion (DCCV)** offers only temporary restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter, with **high recurrence rates**, so definitive therapy with catheter ablation is generally indicated after relapse.
5. The class III antiarrhythmic **dofetilide** can prolong the **QT interval** and has numerous drug–drug interactions; it is **less effective** than catheter ablation for recurrent atrial flutter.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Many patients require combinations of β‑blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin for rate control, which may cause hypotension or bradycardia.
2. Typical atrial flutter is a macro‑reentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus that is interrupted by cavotricuspid isthmus ablation.
3. Long‑term use of amiodarone should be avoided when safer, more effective alternatives exist.
4. In symptomatic patients, DCCV is reasonable acutely, but up to 60–80% will recur within weeks without further therapy.
5. Initiation of dofetilide requires inpatient monitoring because of torsades de pointes risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial flutter** is an **organized macro-reentrant tachycardia** with **discrete regular atrial activity** on ECG, typically with an **atrial rate of 250 to 300 beats per minute**.
2. **Typical atrial flutter** results from **counterclockwise reentry around the tricuspid annulus** and is the dominant form in patients **without prior cardiac disease**.
3. **Typical atrial flutter** shows **inverted flutter waves** in **leads II, III, and aVF** and **positive flutter waves** in **lead V1**.
4. **Atypical atrial flutter** is most commonly seen in patients with **prior atrial fibrillation ablation** or **cardiac surgery** and involves reentry circuits in other parts of the **right or left atria**.
5. **Anticoagulation management** for **chronic atrial flutter** is similar to that for **atrial fibrillation**.
6. **Rhythm control** is generally favored over **rate control** in atrial flutter due to the difficulty of achieving adequate rate control, which often requires **high doses of multiple AV nodal blockers**.
7. **Catheter ablation** is the **definitive treatment** for **typical atrial flutter**, with a **success rate >95%** and **low complication rate**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atrial flutter produces characteristic atrial waveforms distinct from atrial fibrillation, allowing for clearer ECG diagnosis.
2. The tricuspid annulus provides an anatomic substrate for the reentrant circuit in typical flutter.
3. This ECG pattern is a key diagnostic feature for distinguishing typical flutter.
4. Atypical flutter includes post-surgical and post-ablation variants with different reentrant paths.
5. Stroke risk in atrial flutter is managed similarly to atrial fibrillation using CHA₂DS₂-VASc scoring.
6. Rate control failure often necessitates rhythm control strategies in flutter, unlike atrial fibrillation.
7. Ablation offers a curative option for symptomatic or refractory typical flutter.

    <strong>ECG Demonstrating Typical Atrial Flutter</strong><br>
    In this ECG demonstrating typical atrial flutter, negatively directed sawtooth waves are seen in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF), and positive waves are seen in lead V1. In the bottom rhythm strip, 2:1 and 4:1 conduction patterns are most easily seen.
