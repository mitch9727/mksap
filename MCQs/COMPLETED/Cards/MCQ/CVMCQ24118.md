### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)** is recommended over **surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)** for **symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis** who are **older than 80 years**.
2. TAVI is also recommended over SAVR for **symptomatic patients of any age** with **severe aortic stenosis** and **high surgical risk**, provided that **life expectancy is at least 12 months** with **acceptable quality of life**.
3. **Exertional dyspnea**, **syncope**, and **angina** are the most common symptoms in **aortic stenosis**, and once symptoms appear, **life expectancy is generally 1 to 2 years** without valve replacement.
4. TAVI has a **mortality benefit over medical therapy** in patients with **severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis**.
5. **Medical therapy**, such as **diuretics** (e.g., furosemide), is **not preferred** over TAVI in patients with **severe symptomatic aortic stenosis**.
6. Surveillance **echocardiography every 6 to 12 months** is appropriate for **asymptomatic aortic stenosis**, but **symptomatic patients** should be evaluated for **valve replacement**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. TAVI is preferred in elderly patients due to reduced procedural risk and comparable outcomes.
2. High surgical risk includes prior sternotomy, frailty, and multiple comorbidities.
3. This reflects the natural history of untreated symptomatic aortic stenosis.
4. This supports early procedural intervention rather than watchful waiting in eligible patients.
5. Diuretics may manage symptoms temporarily but do not improve survival or valve obstruction.
6. This patient had syncope and evidence of severe valve obstruction, indicating symptomatic disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic valve replacement** is a **life-prolonging procedure** in patients with **severe aortic stenosis**.
2. Indications for aortic valve replacement in severe aortic stenosis include **symptoms** (dyspnea, angina, presyncope, syncope, or heart failure) or **concomitant cardiac surgery** for other indications.
3. Aortic valve replacement is **reasonable in asymptomatic patients** with **left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <50%)**, **very severe aortic stenosis (peak velocity ≥5 m/s)** with low surgical risk, **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >3× normal**, or **abnormal supervised exercise testing**.
4. The choice between **TAVI** and **SAVR** is based on symptoms, surgical risk (via multidisciplinary assessment), and shared decision making.
5. For **symptomatic patients aged >80 years**, **TAVI** is recommended over **SAVR**.
6. For **symptomatic patients aged 65 to 80 years**, either **SAVR or TAVI** is appropriate depending on shared decision making.
7. For **symptomatic patients aged <65 years** or those with **life expectancy >20 years**, **SAVR** is preferred due to the **unknown durability of TAVI**.
8. In **asymptomatic patients with decreased left ventricular function**, the recommendations mirror those of symptomatic patients.
9. In **asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk**, **SAVR is preferred to TAVI** when appropriate.
10. **Statins** have been shown to be **ineffective in slowing progression** of aortic stenosis despite its **inflammatory pathophysiology**.
11. For patients with **hypertension or heart failure**, **guideline-directed medical therapy** is recommended.
12. **Balloon valvuloplasty** may be used in select unstable patients as a **bridge to TAVI or SAVR**, but has **limited long-term benefit**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Valve replacement improves survival by relieving outflow obstruction.
2. Cardiac surgery may include CABG or ascending aortic repair in addition to valve replacement.
3. These criteria identify patients at higher risk despite lack of symptoms.
4. This individualized approach aligns with current ACC/AHA guidelines.
5. TAVI offers favorable outcomes with reduced invasiveness in the elderly.
6. Shared decision making accounts for patient values, anatomy, and procedural risks.
7. SAVR is more durable and appropriate for younger patients with long life expectancy.
8. Asymptomatic reduced EF indicates subclinical cardiac decompensation needing intervention.
9. TAVI is typically reserved for higher-risk or older patients in this population.
10. Trials have failed to show benefit of statins in valve calcification regression.
11. This includes ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, and diuretics when clinically indicated.
12. Temporary hemodynamic improvement allows stabilization for definitive intervention.
