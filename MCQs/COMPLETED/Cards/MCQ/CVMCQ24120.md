### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: Transcatheter Repair for Secondary Mitral Regurgitation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic mitral regurgitation** is classified as **secondary** when caused by issues external to the valve annulus, most commonly **ventricular dysfunction**.
2. In **chronic secondary mitral regurgitation**, initial therapy should target the **ventricular dysfunction** with **guideline-directed medical therapy** and, if indicated, **cardiac resynchronization therapy**.
3. The benefit of **surgical mitral valve repair or replacement** in **secondary mitral regurgitation** is uncertain and not first-line therapy.
4. **Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER)** with a **clip device** is indicated for patients with **chronic secondary mitral regurgitation** who have **refractory symptoms despite optimal heart failure therapy**.
5. The **COAPT trial** demonstrated that **TEER** reduced **mortality** and **heart failure hospitalization**, regardless of **atrial fibrillation** status.
6. Criteria for **TEER eligibility** include **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 20% and 50%** and **left ventricular end-diastolic diameter <7 cm**.
7. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** may be used when **echocardiography** is insufficient to determine **mitral regurgitation severity or mechanism**, but is unnecessary when the diagnosis is already established.
8. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** should precede TEER if indicated for **heart failure**, such as in **left bundle branch block** or **QRS duration ≥150 ms**.
9. **Surgical mitral valve repair** is not supported by **prospective randomized trials** for **secondary mitral regurgitation** and is not considered **first-line therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra
4. TEER improves leaflet coaptation, reducing mitral regurgitation and improving forward flow.
5. The COAPT trial is the primary randomized controlled trial supporting TEER in this population.
6. These anatomical and functional thresholds are used to define the group most likely to benefit from TEER.
8. CRT is not indicated in this patient due to a normal QRS duration.
9. Despite surgery being an option during concomitant procedures (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting), it is not preferred alone due to uncertain benefit.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In **acute severe mitral regurgitation**, **vasodilator therapy** such as **nitroprusside** reduces afterload and improves **forward cardiac output**.
2. An **intra-aortic balloon pump** can augment **systemic and coronary perfusion pressures** in **acute severe mitral regurgitation** with **cardiogenic shock**.
3. **Prompt surgical correction** should be considered in all patients with **acute severe mitral regurgitation**.
4. In **chronic severe primary mitral regurgitation**, **surgical mitral valve repair** is indicated in **symptomatic patients**, and in **asymptomatic patients** with **LV dysfunction** (ejection fraction ≤60% or LV end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm).
5. **Surgical repair** is preferred over **replacement** for **primary mitral regurgitation**, and patients should be referred to **centers with repair expertise**.
6. **Medical therapy with vasodilators** is not beneficial for **primary mitral regurgitation** in the absence of **symptoms or LV dysfunction**.
7. For patients who are **not surgical candidates**, **transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER)** improves **mitral valve coaptation** and reduces **regurgitation**.
8. In **selected patients with primary mitral regurgitation**, **TEER** has an approximate **90% success rate** and a **2% procedural mortality rate**.
9. In **chronic secondary mitral regurgitation**, **guideline-directed medical therapy** should include an **ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)**; a **β-blocker**; a **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor**; a **diuretic**; and/or an **aldosterone antagonist**.
10. Surgery for **secondary severe mitral regurgitation** may be reasonable during **coronary artery bypass grafting**, but **regurgitation often recurs** after repair due to **primary LV dysfunction**.
11. **TEER** is **FDA-approved** for patients with **ejection fraction 20%–50%**, **chronic secondary mitral regurgitation**, and **refractory symptoms** despite optimal medical therapy.
12. The **impact of TEER on mortality and hospitalization** has **varied across studies**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Nitroprusside’s rapid titratability makes it suitable for acute afterload reduction.
2. Mechanical circulatory support devices provide hemodynamic stabilization.
4. Valve repair improves survival and symptom burden when criteria are met.
6. Vasodilator therapy lacks evidence of benefit in chronic compensated primary mitral regurgitation.
8. TEER is performed percutaneously using a clip device placed at the mitral valve leaflet edges.
9. These medications address underlying ventricular dysfunction that drives secondary regurgitation.
11. Approval is based on COAPT criteria; patients must be symptomatic despite optimized therapy.
12. The MITRA-FR trial did not show benefit, in contrast to COAPT.
