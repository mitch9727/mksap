### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: Chronic Severe Aortic Regurgitation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In chronic **aortic regurgitation**, **aortic valve replacement (AVR)** is advised for patients with **symptoms**, most typically **dyspnea** or **angina**.
2. **Aortic valve replacement** is indicated in chronic **aortic regurgitation** when **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)** is **≤55%** and no other cause of dysfunction is present.
3. **Aortic valve replacement** is also recommended in patients with **severe aortic regurgitation** who are undergoing **other cardiac surgery**.
4. Surgical treatment is reasonable in **asymptomatic** patients with **severe aortic regurgitation**, **normal LVEF**, and **significant left ventricular (LV) dilatation**.
5. **Significant LV dilatation** in the context of aortic regurgitation is defined as **LV end-systolic diameter >50 mm** or **indexed end-systolic dimension >25 mm/m²**.
6. **Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)** is **not currently indicated** for the treatment of **aortic regurgitation**.
7. In **chronic aortic regurgitation** with **concomitant hypertension**, preferred medical therapy includes **dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**, or **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**.
8. **Medical therapy** for hypertension does **not eliminate the need for surgery** in patients with **severe aortic regurgitation** when surgical criteria are met.
9. For **asymptomatic** patients with **severe aortic regurgitation**, **normal LVEF**, and **no LV dilation**, **monitoring** with **clinical evaluation** and **echocardiography every 6 to 12 months** is appropriate.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Symptoms in chronic aortic regurgitation usually develop late and may include exertional dyspnea or anginal chest pain.
2. AVR in this setting prevents irreversible LV dysfunction and adverse outcomes.
4. LV dilation is used as a surrogate for impending LV dysfunction in asymptomatic patients.
6. TAVI devices lack sufficient radial force to secure in noncalcified aortic roots typical of aortic regurgitation.
7. These medications reduce afterload and may slow LV dilation.
9. Serial imaging ensures timely identification of LV enlargement or dysfunction.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic regurgitation** arises from either **aortic root pathology** or **intrinsic aortic valve disease**.
2. Causes of **chronic aortic regurgitation** include **ascending aortic dilatation**, **bicuspid valve disease**, **calcific degeneration**, **rheumatic involvement**, and **chest irradiation**.
3. Causes of **acute aortic regurgitation** include **aortic dissection**, **infective endocarditis**, **blunt chest trauma**, and **iatrogenic damage** (e.g., balloon aortic valvuloplasty).
4. In **chronic aortic regurgitation**, **volume overload** leads to **left ventricular (LV) dilatation** and **eccentric hypertrophy**.
5. Symptoms of **chronic aortic regurgitation** include **shortness of breath**, **fatigue**, and **angina**.
6. Physical findings in **chronic aortic regurgitation** may include **bounding peripheral pulses**, **displaced LV apex**, and a **diastolic decrescendo murmur**.
7. A **diastolic decrescendo murmur** in aortic regurgitation may be heard along the **right sternal border** (suggesting root pathology) or **left sternal border** (suggesting valve pathology).
8. A **systolic ejection murmur** may also be heard in **chronic aortic regurgitation** due to the **large forward stroke volume**.
9. In **acute aortic regurgitation**, bounding pulses may be absent and murmurs softer or shorter due to **rapid pressure equalization** between the aorta and LV.
10. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is indicated for the evaluation of **aortic regurgitation** and **LV function**.
11. If TTE is suboptimal or discordant with clinical findings, further evaluation may include **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)**, **cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging**, or **cardiac catheterization**.
12. Criteria for **severe aortic regurgitation** include:
    - Jet width occupying ≥65% of the LV outflow tract
    - **Vena contracta** >0.6 cm
    - **Holodiastolic flow** in the descending aorta
    - **Regurgitant volume** ≥60 mL
    - **Effective regurgitant orifice area** ≥0.3 cm²
13. The **left ventricle** is typically **dilated** in patients with **chronic aortic regurgitation**.
14. In suspected **aortic root abnormalities**, evaluation with **CMR imaging**, **CT**, or **TEE** is recommended.
15. In **acute aortic regurgitation** with **aortic dissection**, **CT angiography** is indicated due to its high accuracy and rapid availability.
16. **Surveillance** of patients with **aortic regurgitation** depends on the **severity of regurgitation** and other clinical factors.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Aortic root pathology includes dilation of the ascending aorta or sinuses of Valsalva, while intrinsic valve disease includes leaflet abnormalities.
2. These chronic etiologies tend to progress slowly, allowing adaptive LV remodeling before symptoms develop.
3. Iatrogenic damage may occur during cardiac procedures that involve the aortic valve.
4. Eccentric hypertrophy maintains cardiac output for some time before symptoms emerge.
6. Bounding pulses are due to wide pulse pressure from increased stroke volume and low diastolic pressure.
9. Rapid equalization of diastolic pressures reduces murmur duration and intensity.
11. Each modality offers advantages: CMR for quantification, TEE for visualization, catheterization for hemodynamics.
12. These are standard echocardiographic and Doppler criteria used to define severe regurgitation.
15. CT is preferred over MRI in emergencies due to speed and availability.
