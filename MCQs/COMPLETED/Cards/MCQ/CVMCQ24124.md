### 🫠 Cardiac Devices: Management of CIED Infections

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)–related pocket infections** are treated with **2 weeks of antibiotic therapy** and **complete removal** of the device generator and all transvenous leads.
2. **CIED-related infections with positive blood cultures** or **lead wire/valve vegetations** on echocardiography require **device removal** and **4 to 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy**.
3. **CIED pocket aspiration** is never indicated because it may introduce infection or worsen an existing one.
4. **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** can support the diagnosis of CIED-related endocarditis, but removal of infected devices is based on **clinical findings**, not imaging alone.
5. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is only required in CIED infection workup **if bacteremia is confirmed** by blood cultures.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Local signs of a pocket infection include **swelling**, **erythema**, **warmth**, **tenderness**, and **purulent discharge**, often without systemic signs.
2. Antibiotic duration decisions depend on blood and pocket culture results and echocardiographic findings.
3. Pocket aspiration provides no diagnostic benefit and carries procedural risk.
4. When there is clinical evidence of infection, PET/CT should not delay definitive management.
5. TEE is useful to evaluate for deeper device-related infection only if bloodstream infection is present.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Up to **5% of patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)** will develop a device-related infection within **3 years of implantation**.
2. **CIED-related infection** may be limited to the **generator pocket** or involve the **entire system**, including intravascular leads.
3. **CIED infection diagnosis** requires a **high index of suspicion**, as symptoms may be subtle or insidious.
4. **Blood culture testing and echocardiography** are essential in the evaluation of patients with suspected **CIED-related infection**.
5. **Empiric antibiotic therapy prior to blood cultures** may delay or obscure the diagnosis of CIED-related infection.
6. **Diagnostic aspiration of the CIED pocket** is contraindicated due to the risk of introducing infection.
7. **Effective treatment of CIED infection** involves **complete hardware extraction**, **pocket debridement**, **prolonged antibiotic therapy**, and **reimplantation at a new site** after eradication of infection.
8. **Signs of clinical pocket/generator infection** include **swelling**, **erythema**, **warmth**, **pain**, **purulent discharge**, **sinus formation**, **deformation**, or **threatened erosion** of the generator or leads.
9. **Patients with isolated pocket infections** typically have **negative blood cultures** and **no evidence of vegetations** on transesophageal echocardiography and require **2 weeks of antibiotics plus complete device removal**.
10. In patients with **positive blood cultures** or **lead/valve vegetations on TEE**, **4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics** and **device extraction** are required.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Infection rates are increasing with the widespread use of permanent cardiac devices.
2. Pocket-limited infections may present with only local signs and no systemic illness.
3. Delayed diagnosis increases the risk of systemic infection and complications.
4. Echocardiography, especially transesophageal, helps assess lead and valve involvement.
5. Initiating antibiotics before cultures reduces diagnostic sensitivity.
6. Pocket aspiration can convert a sterile site into an infected one.
7. New site reimplantation is typically delayed until after microbiologic cure.
8. These local signs may evolve over days to weeks and precede systemic findings.
9. Absence of bacteremia or vegetations does not rule out pocket infection.
10. Common pathogens include **Staphylococcus aureus**, **coagulase-negative staphylococci**, and **enterococci**.
