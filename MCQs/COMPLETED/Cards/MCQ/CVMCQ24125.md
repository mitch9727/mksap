### 🫀 Cardiology: Anticoagulation for Mechanical Aortic Valve

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with a **mechanical cardiac valve** require **lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin** for thromboembolism prophylaxis.
2. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**, including **dabigatran** and **apixaban**, are **contraindicated** in mechanical valves because trials (RE‑ALIGN, PROACT Xa) showed excess **bleeding** and **thromboembolic events** compared with warfarin.
3. Anticoagulation for mechanical valves should target a **single international normalized ratio (INR) value**, not a range, and the target depends on valve type and risk factors.
4. For a **mechanical bileaflet or current‑generation single‑tilting disc aortic valve** **without additional risk factors** (prior embolism, hypercoagulability, left ventricular dysfunction, or atrial fibrillation), the recommended **target INR is 2.5**.
5. For a **mechanical aortic valve with thromboembolic risk factors**, an **older ball‑in‑cage aortic valve**, or **any mechanical mitral valve**, the recommended **target INR is 3.0**.
6. **Low‑dose aspirin** is **not routinely added** to warfarin for mechanical valves solely for valve prophylaxis; it may be co‑administered for separate indications (such as **coronary artery disease**) when bleeding risk is low.
7. **Aspirin monotherapy** is inadequate for prevention of valve thrombosis in patients with **mechanical valves** and is reasonable only in patients with a **bioprosthetic valve** who have no other indication for anticoagulation.
8. If the **INR remains persistently above the target**, the **warfarin dosage should be reduced** to lower bleeding risk while preserving thromboembolic protection.
9. During **temporary interruption** of warfarin for **active bleeding** in a patient with a mechanical **aortic valve** **without additional thromboembolic risk factors**, **heparin bridging is unnecessary**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Additional thromboembolic risk factors include a **history of systemic embolization**, **hypercoagulable disorders**, **left ventricular dysfunction**, and **atrial fibrillation**.
2. The shift away from routine aspirin with warfarin is based on evidence that combined therapy increases bleeding without added thromboembolic benefit in most patients with mechanical valves.
3. Warfarin dose adjustment should aim for a **target INR**, recognizing that values above goal markedly increase the risk of **gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **bioprosthetic valve** is preferred in patients of any age who **cannot or do not wish to take warfarin**, despite its limited durability of roughly **15 years**.
2. Approximately **40% of bioprosthetic valves** implanted in persons **younger than 60 years** exhibit clinically severe deterioration by **15 years** post‑implantation.
3. The **ACC/AHA** considers a **mechanical aortic valve** reasonable in patients **<50 years**, a **bioprosthesis** reasonable in patients **>65 years**, and either option acceptable in those aged **50–65 years**.
4. After **mitral valve replacement**, a **mechanical valve** is generally favored in patients **<65 years**, whereas a **bioprosthesis** is reasonable in those **≥65 years**.
5. **Echocardiography** should be performed soon after prosthetic valve implantation to establish a **baseline hemodynamic profile** and repeated whenever symptoms or signs of valve dysfunction arise.
6. In patients with a **surgical bioprosthetic valve**, **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is reasonable at **5 and 10 years** after surgery and **annually thereafter**, even if asymptomatic.
7. In patients with a **transcatheter bioprosthetic valve**, **annual TTE** is recommended regardless of symptoms.
8. When **TTE** is nondiagnostic for suspected prosthetic valve malfunction, **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** should be obtained.
9. **Lifelong warfarin therapy** targeting a specific **INR** is mandatory for **all mechanical valves**, and **DOACs** should not be used because of increased thrombosis risk.
10. For patients with a **bioprosthetic mitral or aortic valve**, short‑term **warfarin** targeting an **INR of 2.5** can be considered for **3–6 months after implantation** when bleeding risk is low.
11. **Low‑dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day)** may be added to warfarin in patients with a **mechanical prosthesis** who have other indications for antiplatelet therapy and acceptable bleeding risk.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Valve choice** is influenced by patient age, expected prosthesis durability, surgical re‑operation risk, and willingness to take warfarin.
2. Current data suggest that **transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)** durability at **8–10 years** is comparable to surgical bioprostheses, but longer‑term data are pending.
3. Decisions between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves should be made through **shared decision making** incorporating patient preferences and comorbidities.
