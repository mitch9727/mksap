### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: Bicuspid Aortic Valve Aortopathy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bicuspid aortic valve disease** affects approximately **1% to 2% of the population** and commonly presents as an **asymptomatic systolic murmur** in adolescence or young adulthood.
2. Patients with **bicuspid aortic valve disease** are at risk for **aortic abnormalities**, including **aneurysm**, **dissection**, and **coarctation**.
3. Evaluation of **bicuspid aortic valve disease** should include imaging of the **aortic root**, **ascending aorta**, and **aortic arch**.
4. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is typically the initial imaging modality for bicuspid aortic valve evaluation but may be limited in assessing the thoracic aorta.
5. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** or **CT angiography (CTA)** is indicated when **TTE provides suboptimal imaging** of the aorta.
6. In patients with a **bicuspid aortic valve** and an **aortic root or ascending aorta diameter ≥4.0 cm**, **lifelong serial imaging** of the aortic root and ascending aorta is reasonable.
7. Surveillance frequency of a **bicuspid aortic valve with mild regurgitation** should be **every 3 to 5 years**, not every 2 years.
8. **Angiotensin receptor blockers**, such as **losartan**, are not proven to slow **aortic dilation** in patients with **bicuspid aortopathy**.
9. In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** may clarify valve morphology but cannot adequately visualize the full **ascending aorta**.
10. **TEE** has a known **"blind spot"** for the ascending aorta due to tracheal interposition, making it a **second-line** option after **CMR** or **CTA** for evaluating the thoracic aorta.
11. **No further evaluation** is not appropriate in patients with **newly diagnosed bicuspid aortic valve** and **inadequate TTE imaging** of the aorta.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The systolic murmur is often the first clue to bicuspid valve pathology during routine physical exams in adolescents and young adults.
3. Imaging is crucial to detect associated aortopathy even in the absence of significant valvular dysfunction.
4. TTE is noninvasive and widely available but limited by body habitus and thoracic anatomy in some patients.
6. Ongoing evaluation helps assess the risk of complications such as dissection or need for surgical repair.
8. Although effective in **Marfan syndrome**, **losartan** has not shown efficacy in bicuspid aortic dilation and is not routinely indicated unless **hypertension** is also present.
9. TEE remains valuable when **valve morphology** is not clearly visualized on TTE.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bicuspid aortic valve disease** causes **abnormal shear forces**, leading to **early degeneration** and **valvular stenosis** in up to **75%** of patients.
2. **Pure aortic regurgitation** occurs in **2% to 10%** of patients with **bicuspid aortic valve disease**.
3. Progression of **bicuspid aortic valve disease** typically leads to **severe disease in the fifth or sixth decade of life**.
4. More than **one third of individuals over age 70** with **severe aortic stenosis** have an underlying **bicuspid valve**.
5. **Aortic aneurysm**, **dissection**, and **coarctation** may occur **independently of valvular dysfunction** in bicuspid valve disease.
6. **First-degree relatives** of patients with **bicuspid aortic valve** may be considered for **screening echocardiography**, even in the absence of symptoms.
7. **Surgical repair** of the **ascending aorta** is recommended if the **diameter >5.5 cm**, or **>5.0 cm with risk factors** like family history or rapid growth.
8. **Surgical repair** of the **ascending aorta** during **valve surgery** is reasonable if the diameter is **≥4.5 cm**.
9. **No medical therapy**, including **angiotensin receptor blockers**, has been shown to slow **aortic dilation** in bicuspid aortopathy.
10. **Blood pressure control** is important in patients with **bicuspid aortic valve disease** and **concomitant hypertension**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Abnormal flow dynamics across a bicuspid valve contribute to premature valve damage.
3. Disease progression is gradual but predictable, underscoring the importance of surveillance.
6. Bicuspid aortic valve is a heritable condition, warranting family member screening.
7. Risk factors for dissection include **family history**, **rate of growth ≥0.5 cm/year**, and **connective tissue disease**.
9. This contrasts with **Marfan syndrome**, where **losartan** has a role in slowing aortic growth.
