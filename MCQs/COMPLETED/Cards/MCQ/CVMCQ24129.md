### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Exercise Testing in Mitral Stenosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Mitral stenosis** is characterized by **slow progression of symptoms**, including **fatigue**, **dyspnea**, and **lower extremity edema**.
2. Symptoms of mitral stenosis are typically **exertional** because **exercise shortens diastolic filling time**, increasing **transvalvular flow** and the **diastolic mitral gradient**.
3. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is highly accurate at determining the **severity of mitral stenosis**.
4. **Severe mitral stenosis** is defined by a **mitral valve area of ≤1.5 cm²**, corresponding to a **mean mitral gradient >5 to 10 mm Hg** at a **normal heart rate**.
5. In patients with a **discrepancy between symptoms and echocardiographic findings**, **exercise echocardiography** or **exercise testing during cardiac catheterization** is warranted to assess **mitral gradient and pulmonary pressures**.
6. **Exercise echocardiography** is indicated to **quantitate the degree of mitral stenosis** when resting echocardiographic findings suggest only **moderate mitral stenosis**, but the patient reports **significant symptoms**.
7. **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** can evaluate mitral stenosis in a **resting state** when TTE images are inadequate but does **not assess response to exertion**.
8. **Percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PBMC)** is indicated for **symptomatic severe mitral stenosis** with **favorable valve morphology**.
9. PBMC is not indicated in patients with **only moderate mitral stenosis** on echocardiography unless **exercise testing** confirms severe disease.
10. Patients with **moderate or severe but asymptomatic mitral stenosis** should be monitored with **regular clinical evaluation** and **serial echocardiography** every **3–5 years** for mild and **annually** for severe disease.
11. In symptomatic patients with discordant findings, **waiting 1 year to repeat echocardiography** is not appropriate; **exercise testing** should be performed.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These symptoms are due to decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary congestion over time.
2. Exertion increases left atrial pressure due to impaired mitral inflow dynamics.
3. TTE provides mitral valve area and mean gradient to assess severity.
4. These are guideline criteria for diagnosing severe mitral stenosis.
5. Exercise testing reveals hemodynamic changes not captured at rest.
6. This applies when symptoms such as progressive exertional dyspnea are present despite only moderate findings on resting TTE.
7. MRI is useful for anatomical assessment but lacks dynamic testing capability.
8. Valve morphology is assessed to determine PBMC eligibility.
9. Exercise echocardiography may reveal more severe functional limitation than resting images suggest.
10. Surveillance intervals are based on the degree of stenosis and absence of symptoms.
11. Significant symptoms warrant earlier evaluation to guide potential intervention.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **leading cause of mitral stenosis** is **rheumatic heart disease**, which is more common in **women (4:1 ratio)**.
2. Other causes of mitral stenosis include **parachute mitral valve**, **chest irradiation**, and **severe mitral annular calcification**.
3. **Mitral annular calcification** is more common in **older adults** and is associated with **inflammatory disorders**, **peripheral artery disease**, and **chronic kidney disease**.
4. The natural history of mitral stenosis involves **gradual left atrial enlargement** with **preserved left ventricular function**.
5. Symptoms of mitral stenosis may arise from **low cardiac output**, **pulmonary congestion**, and **pulmonary hypertension with right-sided heart failure**.
6. **Pregnancy** can precipitate symptoms of mitral stenosis due to **increased blood volume and cardiac output**.
7. Exertional symptoms occur because **exercise shortens diastolic filling time**, increasing **transvalvular flow and the diastolic mitral gradient**, worsening **left atrial hypertension**.
8. Clinical findings in pliable mitral valves include **tapping left ventricular impulse**, **loud S1**, **opening snap**, and a **low-pitched diastolic murmur** at the apex.
9. TTE is highly accurate for assessing **mitral stenosis severity**, **pulmonary pressures**, **right ventricular function**, and **concomitant valvular lesions**.
10. Severe mitral stenosis is defined as a **mitral valve area ≤1.5 cm²**, corresponding to a **mean mitral gradient >5 to 10 mm Hg** at a normal heart rate.
11. In patients with **discrepant symptoms and echocardiographic findings**, **exercise echocardiography** or **exercise catheterization** should be performed.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Rheumatic heart disease causes commissural fusion and valvular calcification.
2. These are rare but recognized nonrheumatic causes.
3. Mitral annular calcification affects fibrous rings and is common in comorbid older adults.
4. Left ventricular systolic function typically remains normal until late disease.
5. Fatigue, dyspnea, and edema are common clinical manifestations.
6. Hemodynamic stress during pregnancy can unmask latent mitral obstruction.
7. Diastolic crowding from tachycardia during exertion leads to rising LA pressures.
8. These findings help differentiate mitral stenosis from other valvular diseases on exam.
9. Echocardiography is the primary diagnostic tool.
10. These measurements guide decisions on medical therapy and intervention.
11. Functional studies are required when imaging and symptoms diverge.

    Echocardiograms showing a normal mitral valve (MV) (top left panel) and rheumatic mitral stenosis with commissural fusion (arrowheads, top right panel). In the bottom left panel, diastolic doming (arrowhead) is present with a “hockey stick” deformity from mitral stenosis. In the bottom right panel, a Doppler echocardiogram shows a mitral gradient of 13 mm Hg, consistent with severe stenosis. Ao = ascending aorta; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.
