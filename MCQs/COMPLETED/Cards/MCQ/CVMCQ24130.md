### 🫠 Cardiovascular Medicine: Management of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Tricuspid regurgitation** is most commonly **functional** and **clinically asymptomatic**.
2. **Primary tricuspid regurgitation**, when severe and symptomatic, may present with **elevated jugular venous pressure** (a large c-v wave), **hepatic congestion with pulsatile liver and ascites**, and **peripheral edema**.
3. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is used to identify **secondary causes** of tricuspid regurgitation, assess **right ventricular (RV) function**, and estimate **pulmonary pressures**.
4. **Diuretic therapy** is the **first-line treatment** for tricuspid regurgitation to relieve symptoms of **right-sided congestion**.
5. **Tricuspid valve surgery** may be considered in patients with **severe primary tricuspid regurgitation** or **severe secondary symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation refractory to medical therapy**.
6. **Percutaneous tricuspid valve replacement** or **tricuspid edge-to-edge repair** may be considered in patients with **severe tricuspid regurgitation** and **normal RV function**.
7. In patients with **severe symptomatic primary tricuspid regurgitation** refractory to diuretics, **tricuspid valve replacement** should be considered.
8. **Further escalation of diuretic therapy** may be limited by **blood pressure** and **kidney function**, especially when high doses have already been used.
9. A **mildly elevated RV systolic pressure** is **not consistent** with **severe pulmonary hypertension**.
10. Findings suggestive of **congestive hepatopathy** include **elevated jugular venous pressure**, **normal INR**, **elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)**, and **elevated serum ascites albumin gradient** with **high ascitic total protein**.
11. **Liver biopsy** is **not indicated** when clinical findings support a diagnosis of **congestive hepatopathy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient had **severe tricuspid regurgitation**, **congestive hepatopathy**, and **lower extremity edema** despite high-dose **torsemide** and **spironolactone**, indicating **refractory volume overload**.
2. The presence of **normal INR**, **elevated BNP**, and **ascitic fluid characteristics** helped differentiate **congestive hepatopathy** from **primary liver disease**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Tricuspid regurgitation** is the **most common** form of tricuspid valve disease and is frequently **functional (secondary)** and **asymptomatic**.
2. Causes of tricuspid regurgitation include **cor pulmonale**, **pulmonary hypertension**, **right ventricular failure**, **pacemaker or defibrillator lead placement**, **trauma**, **congenital abnormalities**, and **infective endocarditis**.
3. Symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation may include **fatigue**, **elevated jugular venous pressure**, **palpable RV lift**, **hepatic congestion with pulsatile liver**, and **peripheral edema**.
4. The murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is typically a **holosystolic murmur** along the **left sternal border** that **increases during inspiration**.
5. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** may be required in patients with **device-associated tricuspid regurgitation** when the etiology is unclear on TTE.
6. **Medical therapy** with **loop diuretics** and **aldosterone antagonists** improves **right-sided congestion** but risks **low cardiac output**.
7. **Surgery is recommended** for patients with **severe tricuspid regurgitation** undergoing **left-sided valve surgery**.
8. **Isolated tricuspid valve surgery** may be considered for **severe primary tricuspid regurgitation** or **severe secondary symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation** that is **refractory to medical therapy**.
9. **Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement** and **tricuspid edge-to-edge repair** reduce **tricuspid regurgitation**, improve **quality of life** and **functional capacity**, but **do not improve survival**.


#### 💬 Extra
1. **Functional (secondary) tricuspid regurgitation** most commonly results from **right ventricular dilation or pressure overload**, such as from **pulmonary hypertension** or **left-sided heart disease**.
2. The **inspiratory augmentation** of the tricuspid regurgitation murmur is due to **increased venous return**, a hallmark of **right-sided murmurs**.
3. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** provides better visualization of **device-related causes** of tricuspid regurgitation, such as **lead impingement** on the valve leaflets.
4. The **quality-of-life improvements** seen with **percutaneous therapies** are typically measured by tools like the **Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)** or **6-minute walk test**.
