### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: Management of Severe Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PBMC)** is the treatment of choice for eligible patients with **severe symptomatic rheumatic mitral stenosis**.
2. **Severe rheumatic mitral stenosis** is defined as a **mitral valve area ≤1.5 cm²**.
3. PBMC is indicated in **symptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis** and **favorable valve morphology**.
4. PBMC is reasonable in **asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis** and a **pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥50 mm Hg** or **atrial fibrillation**.
5. In appropriately selected patients, PBMC has a **success rate of 95%** and a **complication rate <5%**.
6. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is required before PBMC to exclude a **left atrial thrombus** or **moderate to severe mitral insufficiency**, either of which precludes the procedure.
7. **PBMC is contraindicated** in patients with **calcified nonpliable valves**, **moderate to severe mitral regurgitation**, or **left atrial thrombus**.
8. **Mitral valve replacement** is indicated for patients with **severe symptomatic mitral stenosis** and a **nonpliable valve**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PBMC is preferred over surgery due to lower risks of **endocarditis**, **thrombotic complications**, and **need for anticoagulation**.
6. TEE is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in detecting PBMC contraindications.
7. Contraindications are based on anatomical and safety considerations outlined in the **2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease guidelines**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. PBMC is the procedure of choice for **significant rheumatic mitral stenosis** if the valve is **pliable** and **not severely calcified**.
2. PBMC is indicated in **symptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis and favorable valve morphology**.
3. PBMC is reasonable in **asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis** and a **pulmonary artery systolic pressure >50 mm Hg**.
4. PBMC should **not** be performed in patients with **left atrial thrombus** or **moderate/severe mitral regurgitation**, both best evaluated using **TEE**.
5. **Mitral valve surgery** is indicated in patients with **severe mitral stenosis**, **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms**, and a **nonpliable valve**, or in **asymptomatic patients undergoing cardiac surgery** for another indication.
6. Nearly **50% of patients with mitral stenosis** have **atrial fibrillation**.
7. In patients with **mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation**, **vitamin K antagonist therapy (e.g., warfarin)** with an **international normalized ratio (INR) goal of 2.0–3.0** is recommended.
8. The **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score** is **not used** to stratify thromboembolism risk in **mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation**.
9. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** were excluded from initial trials in patients with **moderate to severe mitral stenosis** and may be **less effective than warfarin**.
10. **Medical therapy** with **negative chronotropic agents**, **diuretics**, and **long-acting nitrates** may palliate symptoms in **non-candidates for intervention**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Favorable anatomy is determined by valve morphology assessed on imaging.
5. Concomitant surgical procedures may justify valve replacement even if asymptomatic.
7. Warfarin is the standard anticoagulant in mitral stenosis-related atrial fibrillation, based on historical trial evidence.
9. A recent trial showed **increased risk with rivaroxaban** compared to warfarin in rheumatic heart disease with atrial fibrillation.
10. Symptom palliation is important in high-risk or inoperable patients, despite not altering disease progression.
