### 🫠 Pericardial Disease: Management of Idiopathic Pericardial Effusion

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In an **asymptomatic patient with an isolated idiopathic pericardial effusion**, **serial echocardiography** is recommended to monitor the stability of the effusion.
2. An **idiopathic pericardial effusion** without clinical symptoms does **not require immediate diagnostic or therapeutic intervention**.
3. **Serial echocardiography** should be performed **every 2 to 4 weeks for the first 3 months**, then **tailored** based on stability and clinical course.
4. **Anakinra**, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is used for **recurrent idiopathic pericarditis** refractory to standard therapy, but **has no role** in asymptomatic idiopathic pericardial effusion.
5. **First-line therapy for acute idiopathic pericarditis** includes **aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** plus **adjunctive colchicine**, but is **not indicated** without clinical signs of pericarditis.
6. **Therapeutic or diagnostic pericardiocentesis** is indicated in the presence of **cardiac tamponade** or **suspicion for infectious or systemic inflammatory etiologies**, but not in uncomplicated, asymptomatic effusion.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Pericardial effusions are often detected incidentally on imaging modalities such as **chest radiography**, **computed tomography (CT)**, or **echocardiography**.
2. Routine laboratory workup may include **complete blood count**, **serum electrolytes**, **blood urea nitrogen**, **serum creatinine**, **thyroid-stimulating hormone**, **antinuclear antibody**, and **chest radiograph**, but extensive testing rarely yields a diagnosis if initial evaluation is unrevealing.
4. **Anakinra** may be considered for patients with **recurrent pericarditis**, particularly when corticosteroids or colchicine are ineffective.
5. Pharmacologic treatment for pericarditis requires **clinical features** such as **fever**, **pleuritic chest pain**, **electrocardiographic changes**, and/or **elevated inflammatory markers**.
6. **Pericardiocentesis** is also considered for **large effusions** persisting **more than 3 months** due to risk of progression to tamponade.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pericardial effusions** are frequently **asymptomatic** and discovered **incidentally** on **chest radiograph**, **CT scan**, or **echocardiogram**.
2. In **asymptomatic patients**, the majority of **pericardial effusions** are **idiopathic**, but causes such as **malignancy**, **infection**, **autoimmune disease**, **hypothyroidism**, and **iatrogenic factors** (e.g., medications, anticoagulation) should also be considered.
3. In regions where **tuberculosis is endemic**, over **60% of pericardial effusions** are due to **tuberculosis**.
4. **Pericardiocentesis** should be pursued if **cancer**, **tuberculosis**, or **bacterial infection** is strongly suspected.
5. In patients with **pericardial effusion of unknown cause** and **elevated inflammatory markers**, **empiric treatment of pericarditis** may be appropriate.
6. **Large idiopathic pericardial effusions** persisting longer than **3 months** should be considered for **drainage**, as **one in three** may progress to **cardiac tamponade**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. **Iatrogenic causes** may include **drug-induced effusions** or those secondary to **procedures or anticoagulant use**.
3. Epidemiologic considerations vary by geography; tuberculosis is a **leading cause of effusion** in **developing countries**.
5. Elevated **C-reactive protein** or **erythrocyte sedimentation rate** may support the diagnosis of underlying pericarditis.
6. Chronic idiopathic effusions should be monitored closely given their **risk of hemodynamic compromise** over time.
