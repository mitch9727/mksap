### 🫀 Coronary Artery Disease: Stress Testing in Stable Angina

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stress testing** is the appropriate diagnostic test in patients with an **intermediate pretest probability (10%-90%)** of **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
2. **Stress testing with imaging** is more sensitive for detecting **CAD**, provides **anatomic and functional information**, and is preferred in patients with an **abnormal baseline electrocardiogram (ECG)**.
3. **Exercise-based stress testing** is preferred over **pharmacologic stress testing** when possible, because **exertional capacity** offers **prognostic information**.
4. **Imaging modalities** in stress testing compare **wall motion**, **perfusion**, and/or **metabolism** at rest and with stress.
5. **Stress echocardiography** is an appropriate initial diagnostic test for patients with **intermediate CAD probability** and **baseline ECG abnormalities** such as **left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes**.
6. **Invasive coronary angiography** is not a first-line test for stable angina in patients with **intermediate CAD probability**; it is reserved for patients with **very high pretest probability** or **high-risk stress test results**.
7. **Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring** identifies the presence and burden of **CAD**, but does **not determine the degree of obstruction** and is less specific than stress testing for diagnosing angina.
8. **Exercise ECG stress testing** is **not appropriate** in the presence of **baseline ECG abnormalities** such as **left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This applies to patients with symptoms suggestive of angina and one or more cardiovascular risk factors.
2. Imaging can identify ischemia even when resting ECG abnormalities preclude interpretation of stress-induced changes.
3. Exercise duration and workload achieved are associated with long-term cardiovascular outcomes.
4. These physiologic parameters increase the sensitivity and specificity of the stress test.
5. The patient's resting ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities.
6. Catheterization is used when noninvasive testing reveals high-risk anatomy or significant ischemia.
7. CAC scoring may support risk stratification but lacks the ability to localize flow-limiting lesions.
8. Resting ECG abnormalities can mask ischemic changes, making results uninterpretable.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stable angina pectoris** is defined as **reproducible discomfort or pressure** in the **chest, neck, arms, or abdomen** for **more than 2 months**, triggered by **exertion or emotional stress**, and relieved by **rest or nitroglycerin**.
2. **Unstable angina** includes **new-onset angina**, angina at **rest**, or **worsening angina**, and is considered part of the **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)** spectrum.
3. **Baseline resting electrocardiogram (ECG)** is required in all patients with suspected angina to assess for **ongoing ischemia** or **prior injury** and to guide the diagnostic strategy.
4. **Evaluation of stable chest pain** includes **determining pretest probability of CAD** using **history, physical examination, ECG**, and optionally **coronary artery calcium score**.
5. **Stress testing** is most useful in patients with an **intermediate probability** of CAD, but can also provide **prognostic information** in those with a **high pretest probability**.
6. **Chest pain characterization** helps classify symptoms as **cardiac**, **possibly cardiac**, or **noncardiac**, which informs likelihood of CAD.
7. **Demographic groups** such as **women**, **patients with diabetes**, and **older adults** may present with **atypical symptoms** such as **dyspnea, nausea**, or **fatigue** rather than chest pain.
8. The **cardiovascular physical examination** should evaluate for **conditions that mimic angina**, including **aortic stenosis**, **heart failure**, **pulmonary hypertension**, and **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**.
9. **Pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD)** is higher in **older patients**, **men**, and those with **typical anginal symptoms**.
10. **Noninvasive testing** is most beneficial when the **pretest probability of CAD exceeds 15%**.
11. **Low pretest probability groups (≤15%)** may still undergo **testing based on clinical judgment**, especially if coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is available.
12. In patients with **high pretest probability of CAD**, **stress testing** may be used for **prognostic purposes**, but **does not delay initiation of therapy**.
13. **Coronary CT angiography (CTA)** is **preferred** in patients **younger than 65 years** or with **lower suspicion of CAD**.
14. **Functional testing** such as **stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)** or **stress echocardiography** is **preferred** in patients **aged 65 years or older** or with **higher suspicion of CAD**.
15. **Invasive coronary angiography** is reserved for cases where **noninvasive imaging** suggests **left main or multivessel disease**, especially in **proximal or middle segments**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Symptom relief with nitroglycerin supports ischemic origin.
2. These forms of angina represent a higher risk for myocardial infarction.
3. The ECG assists in assessing cardiac risk and selecting the appropriate diagnostic modality.
4. The decision to test should follow shared decision-making principles.
5. Noninvasive testing may still be helpful for risk stratification even in higher risk groups.
6. Classification affects downstream decisions such as whether to pursue testing.
7. These populations may be underdiagnosed if chest pain is not the predominant complaint.
8. These conditions may cause exertional chest symptoms similar to CAD.
9. This is visually supported by the darkest green areas on the figure, representing highest pretest probability.
10. These groups are marked in darker green and orange on the "Pretest Probabilities" chart.
11. Light green regions denote populations in which test utility is more discretionary.
12. Guidelines recommend starting optimal therapy based on clinical presentation even without waiting for test confirmation.
13. Younger patients tend to have fewer calcifications and better image resolution on CTA.
14. These patients are more likely to benefit from ischemia-guided testing and risk stratification.
15. This supports the use of angiography after noninvasive evidence of high-risk disease.
