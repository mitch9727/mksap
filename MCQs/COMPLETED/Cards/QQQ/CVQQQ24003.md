6. **Aldosterone antagonists** such as **spironolactone** or **eplerenone** are recommended only in patients with **non–ST-elevation ACS**, **ejection fraction ≤40%**, and either **heart failure** or **diabetes**, who are already receiving an **ACE inhibitor** and **β-blocker**.
7. **Calcium channel blockers**, such as **amlodipine** and **diltiazem**, are used in patients with **contraindications to β-blockers** or **continued angina** despite optimal therapy, but are not indicated in asymptomatic, normotensive patients.
8. **Immediate-release nifedipine** is contraindicated in **coronary artery disease** due to an association with **increased mortality**.
9. In patients with **myocardial infarction**, a **P2Y12 inhibitor** should be continued for **at least 1 year**, regardless of **stent placement** or **type of stent**.
10. **Ticagrelor** has demonstrated **modest benefit** over **clopidogrel** in ACS patients, based on the **PLATO trial**.
11. **Prasugrel** may be superior to **clopidogrel** but is associated with **higher bleeding risk**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient in the vignette is already receiving **aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin**, which aligns with guideline-directed therapy post-PCI for ACS.
2. After 1 year of DAPT, patients typically continue with **aspirin monotherapy** for secondary prevention.
6. Aldosterone antagonists are **not indicated** in patients with **preserved left ventricular function**.
7. The patient has **no angina** and is **normotensive**, which makes **calcium channel blockers** unnecessary.
10. The **PLATO trial** compared **ticagrelor** and **clopidogrel**, showing a **modest reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events** with ticagrelor.
11. **Prasugrel** should be used cautiously due to **bleeding risk**, especially in older adults or those with a history of stroke.

4. **Prasugrel** is indicated only for patients undergoing **PCI**, and should not be given **before coronary angiography**.
5. **Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors** are reserved for **select PCI cases** with **large thrombus burden**, **no reflow**, or **slow flow**.
6. **Unfractionated heparin** is preferred in patients undergoing PCI with **kidney dysfunction**, as it allows for **monitoring with activated clotting times**.
7. **Fondaparinux** is not indicated during PCI due to **risk of procedural thrombosis**.
8. **ACE inhibitors** should be initiated within **24 hours** in patients with **heart failure**, **LV dysfunction**, **anterior infarction**, or **diabetes**.
9. **Eplerenone** improves outcomes in **STEMI** patients with **EF ≤40%** and **heart failure or diabetes**, especially if started within **1 week** of presentation.
10. **β-Blockers** reduce **ventricular arrhythmias**, **angina**, and **mortality** in ACS; they should be initiated **orally** within 24 hours unless contraindicated.
11. **High-intensity statin therapy** reduces **mortality** and **clinical events** after ACS and should be **initiated during hospitalization**.
12. **Oxygen therapy** is only indicated if **oxygen saturation is <90%**, or if there is **dyspnea** or **heart failure**.
13. **Sublingual nitrates** relieve **chest pain** and reduce **sympathetic activation** during ACS; **intravenous nitroglycerin** may be used for **persistent symptoms**, particularly with **hypertension**.
14. **Aspirin desensitization** may be considered in patients with **aspirin allergy** who require treatment for **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**.
15. **Prasugrel** is **contraindicated** in patients **older than 75 years** or those with a **history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)**.

13. Tolerance to nitrates develops with prolonged use; dosing adjustments are often needed.
14. Desensitization protocols are typically performed under supervision in settings where aspirin is clinically necessary but previously not tolerated.
15. These populations showed higher bleeding risk in prasugrel trials.
16. This pharmacokinetic profile makes ticagrelor preferable in patients with CYP2C19 variants.
17. These β-blockers demonstrated mortality benefit in large clinical trials for heart failure.
18. Dual RAAS blockade increases the risk of **hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal dysfunction**.
19. Eplerenone's benefit is greatest when started within **7 days of infarction**, particularly in those already on an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker.
20. The interaction increases the risk of **statin-induced myopathy**, especially in elderly patients.
21. These conditions heighten sensitivity to nitrates and increase the risk of **severe hypotension**.
22. These agents can exacerbate **bradycardia, conduction delay, or cardiac output reduction** in such patients.
23. Ranolazine is primarily used for **chronic angina** in patients unable to tolerate traditional antianginal agents.
