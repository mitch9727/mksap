### 🫀 Heart Failure: Valsartan-Sacubitril Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Valsartan-sacubitril**, an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), should replace an **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor** or **angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)** in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%.
2. In the **PARADIGM-HF** trial, treatment with **valsartan-sacubitril** reduced the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization compared with **enalapril** in patients with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF.
3. A **36-hour washout period** is required when switching from an **ACE inhibitor** to **valsartan-sacubitril** to minimize the risk of **angioedema**.
4. **Verapamil** and **diltiazem**, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, have negative inotropic effects and are contraindicated in patients with HFrEF.
5. **Ivabradine**, a sinoatrial-node If-current modulator, is indicated for symptomatic HFrEF (LVEF ≤35%) in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate ≥70/min despite maximally tolerated β-blocker therapy.
6. **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)** improves ejection fraction, symptoms, and survival in patients with HFrEF who have NYHA class II–IV symptoms, LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, and left bundle branch block with a QRS duration ≥150 ms (class I) or 120–149 ms (class IIa).

#### 💬 Extra
1. ARNI therapy forms part of first-line, four-pillar guideline-directed medical therapy for symptomatic HFrEF.
2. The trial showed a 20 % relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint over **enalapril** and enrolled >8 000 patients with LVEF <40%.
3. Both ACE inhibition and neprilysin inhibition raise bradykinin levels; separating doses reduces additive bradykinin accumulation and angioedema risk.
4. **Amlodipine** and **felodipine** are neutral in HFrEF and may be used for persistent hypertension when other agents are maximized.
5. **Ivabradine** lowers heart failure hospitalizations and all-cause mortality when added to optimized therapy in eligible patients.
6. CRT provides no benefit in patients with narrow QRS complexes or without electrical dyssynchrony.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Valsartan-sacubitril** combines an angiotensin receptor blocker with a **neprilysin inhibitor**, and neprilysin inhibition increases natriuretic peptide and bradykinin levels, promoting diuresis, natriuresis, and myocardial relaxation in heart failure.
2. In **PARADIGM-HF**, **valsartan-sacubitril** reduced all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization by approximately **20 %** compared with **enalapril** in symptomatic heart failure with LVEF <40%.
3. Compared with **enalapril**, **valsartan-sacubitril** is associated with more **hypotension** but lower rates of acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and cough.
4. The **U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** has approved **valsartan-sacubitril** for chronic heart failure at **any LVEF**, though benefits are greatest when LVEF is below normal.
5. **Valsartan-sacubitril** is contraindicated in patients with a prior history of **angioedema**, even if they previously tolerated an ARB.
6. There is no evidence supporting the use of **valsartan-sacubitril** in **asymptomatic (stage B) heart failure**.
7. Initiation of **valsartan-sacubitril** should be avoided in patients with **systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg** because of the risk of symptomatic hypotension.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Enhanced natriuretic peptide signaling counteracts maladaptive neurohormonal activation in HFrEF.
2. The absolute risk reduction in the primary endpoint was about 4.7 % over a median 27‑month follow‑up.
3. Hypotension arises from vasodilation; neprilysin inhibition does not increase cough because bradykinin breakdown by other enzymes remains intact.
4. Expanded labeling allows clinicians to consider ARNI therapy across the spectrum of LVEF, but clinical trial evidence is strongest for HFrEF.
5. Bradykinin accumulation is implicated in ARNI-related angioedema, necessitating strict avoidance in susceptible patients.
6. Stage B patients derive proven benefit from ACE inhibitors and β‑blockers, not ARNIs.
7. Blood pressure thresholds help identify individuals at risk for early treatment intolerance.
