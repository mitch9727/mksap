### 🫀 Cardiology: Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Warfarin**, a vitamin K antagonist, is indicated for systemic anticoagulation in **all** patients with stage B, C, or D rheumatic **mitral stenosis** who have concomitant **atrial fibrillation** (valvular atrial fibrillation).  
2. Approximately **50 %** of patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis develop atrial fibrillation, and **without anticoagulation their risk of systemic thromboembolism is about 20 %–25 %**.  
3. Anticoagulation with **warfarin** is recommended for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis who have a **history of left atrial thrombus** or prior **systemic embolic events**.  
4. The **CHA₂DS₂‑VASc score** is **not used** to guide anticoagulation decisions in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation.  
5. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**—including **dabigatran**, **rivaroxaban**, **apixaban**, and **edoxaban**—are **not approved** for use in **valvular atrial fibrillation** and may be associated with harm in this population.  
6. **Antiplatelet therapy** (alone or dual) is **inferior to vitamin K antagonists** for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and should **not** be used in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation **unless an additional indication (e.g., coronary artery disease) is present**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Guideline‑directed therapy targets an **international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0–3.0** for warfarin in rheumatic mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation.  
2. This high embolic risk exists **independent of traditional stroke‑risk scores**.  
3. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is preferred for detecting left atrial thrombus before intervention.  
4. Stroke‑risk scores such as **CHA₂DS₂‑VASc** were validated in **nonvalvular** atrial fibrillation and have limited applicability in rheumatic mitral stenosis.  
5. The randomized **INVICTUS–Rheumatic Heart Disease** trial demonstrated a higher composite of cardiovascular events with **rivaroxaban** compared with warfarin in rheumatic valvular atrial fibrillation.  
6. Combination therapy with warfarin + aspirin is reserved for circumstances such as **recent coronary stenting** when bleeding risk is acceptable.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PBMC)** is the **procedure of choice** for severe rheumatic mitral stenosis when the valve is **pliable and not heavily calcified**.  
2. **PBMC** is **indicated** in **symptomatic** patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis and **favorable valve morphology**.  
3. **PBMC** is **reasonable** in **asymptomatic** patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis who have a **pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg**.  
4. **PBMC** should **not** be performed when **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** reveals **left atrial thrombus** or when moderate‑to‑severe **mitral regurgitation** is present.  
5. In appropriately selected patients, **PBMC** achieves a **procedural success rate ≈ 95 %** with **complication rates < 5 %**.  
6. **Surgical mitral valve surgery** (repair or replacement) is indicated for patients with severe mitral stenosis, **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms**, and **unfavorable valve anatomy**, or for **asymptomatic** patients who require **concomitant cardiac surgery** for another indication.  
7. Symptomatic control in rheumatic mitral stenosis can be achieved with **negative chronotropic agents**, **diuretics**, and **long‑acting nitrates** in patients who are **not candidates** for interventional or surgical therapy.  
8. All patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation should receive **warfarin anticoagulation with a target INR of 2.0–3.0**, because **direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended** in this setting.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. A **Wilkins echocardiographic score ≤ 8** typically defines favorable valve morphology for PBMC.  
2. Severe rheumatic mitral stenosis is generally defined as a **mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm²**.  
3. Elevated pulmonary artery pressure reflects **hemodynamic burden** despite lack of symptoms.  
4. Embolization risk during PBMC is increased by left atrial thrombus or significant mitral regurgitation.  
5. Major complications of PBMC include **severe mitral regurgitation** and **cardiac tamponade**.  
6. **Calcification** and **subvalvular fusion** lower the likelihood of successful commissurotomy.  
7. Rate‑slowing agents reduce transmitral gradient by prolonging diastolic filling time, thereby **reducing left atrial pressure and symptoms**.  
8. The randomized **INVICTUS trial** found higher rates of **stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, or vascular death** with **rivaroxaban** compared with warfarin in rheumatic mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation.
