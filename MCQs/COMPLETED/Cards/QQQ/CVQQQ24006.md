### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Anticoagulation for Mechanical Valves in Pregnancy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Pregnant patients with a **mechanical valve prosthesis** are at increased risk for **valve thrombosis**, **bleeding**, and **fetal harm**.
2. **Warfarin** anticoagulation during pregnancy increases the risk for **teratogenicity**, **miscarriage**, and **fetal loss** due to **intracranial hemorrhage**, but may be the safest agent to prevent maternal **prosthetic valve thrombosis**.
3. **Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)** and **unfractionated heparin (UFH)** are safer for the fetus but increase maternal risk by raising the risk of **prosthetic valve thrombosis**.
4. Guidelines recommend it is reasonable to continue **warfarin** during the **first trimester and beyond** if the dose is **≤5 mg daily**.
5. An alternative regimen is **UFH or LMWH** during the **first trimester**, followed by **warfarin** for the **second and third trimesters**.
6. At the time of **delivery**, **warfarin should be discontinued** and replaced with **intravenous UFH**.
7. For pregnant patients with **mechanical prostheses**, **low-dose aspirin** may be added to anticoagulation if there is another indication, but not routinely.
8. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** such as **apixaban** and **dabigatran** should not be used in pregnancy due to lack of safety data and increased complications in nonpregnant patients with mechanical valves.
9. The **goal international normalized ratio (INR)** during warfarin therapy in pregnant patients with mechanical valves is **3**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These risks are particularly concerning during pregnancy due to the hypercoagulable state and hemodynamic changes.
2. Warfarin is effective for maternal protection but poses significant fetal risks, especially in higher doses.
3. The maternal protection offered by heparins may be inadequate for prosthetic valve protection.
4. The teratogenic risk of warfarin increases at doses above 5 mg daily.
5. This regimen attempts to balance fetal safety early in pregnancy with maternal protection later.
6. Discontinuation before delivery reduces fetal risk for hemorrhagic complications during labor.
7. This patient had no indication for aspirin; therefore, it should not be added.
8. Dabigatran is associated with increased thromboembolic and bleeding events in patients with mechanical valves.
9. An INR of 3 provides therapeutic anticoagulation for thrombosis prevention in mechanical valves.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pregnancy is associated with hypercoagulability**, requiring close monitoring and adjustment of anticoagulation regimens.
2. **Prepregnancy counseling** is recommended for all women requiring long-term anticoagulation.
3. **Warfarin, UFH, and LMWH** can all be used during pregnancy with **careful monitoring and dose adjustment**.
4. **Warfarin embryopathy** is associated with **first trimester use** of warfarin, especially at doses **>5 mg daily**.
5. **Warfarin is stopped before delivery** to reduce risk for **fetal intracranial hemorrhage** during labor.
6. Use of **LMWH** in pregnant patients with **mechanical valves** may not provide adequate anticoagulation and requires **anti-Xa level monitoring and dose adjustment**.
7. Patients with **mechanical heart valves** should be managed by a **cardio-obstetrics team** before conception and throughout pregnancy.
8. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** are not recommended during pregnancy, and therapy should be **switched to heparin or warfarin**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This hypercoagulable state increases the risk for maternal thrombosis.
2. Counseling helps women understand maternal and fetal risks of each anticoagulation strategy.
3. Therapeutic targets must be met regardless of anticoagulant choice.
4. Risk is dose-dependent, especially in the embryonic period.
5. This strategy minimizes risk of fetal bleeding from unexpected vaginal delivery.
6. LMWH must be individualized and closely monitored when used in mechanical valve patients.
7. Multidisciplinary management reduces complications in high-risk cardiovascular pregnancies.
8. Safety data on DOACs are insufficient for use in pregnancy.
