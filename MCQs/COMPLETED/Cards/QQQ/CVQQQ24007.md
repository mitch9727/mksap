### 🫀 Cardiology: Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Infection Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients with **possible cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infection** should have at least **two blood cultures** drawn from separate sites.
2. **Pacemaker pocket aspiration** should **never be performed** because it can seed a sterile pocket and precipitate infection, particularly when only superficial cellulitis is present.
3. **Untreated CIED infection** typically progresses to **infective endocarditis**, **sepsis**, and **death**, with a fatality rate approaching **75%–100%**.
4. In confirmed **pocket or systemic CIED infection**, **complete device removal** accompanied by **prolonged antibiotic therapy** is necessary for cure.
5. **Antibiotic therapy alone** without device removal is **not curative** for CIED infection and is associated with a high fatality rate.
6. The **most common pathogens** causing CIED infection are **coagulase‑negative staphylococci** and **Staphylococcus aureus**.
7. A **superficial infection** limited to skin and subcutaneous tissue **without communication with the device pocket** does **not** require device extraction.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Two separate venipuncture sites reduce false‑positive culture results and guide targeted antibiotic therapy.
2. Pocket aspiration creates a tract between skin and generator pocket, introducing bacteria.
3. The quoted fatality rate underscores urgency of accurate diagnosis and definitive treatment.
4. Device removal entails extraction of generator and all leads.
5. Persistent bacteria on device hardware preclude cure with antibiotics alone.
6. These staphylococcal species reflect skin colonization and adherence to hardware.
7. Clinical assessment must confirm absence of pocket communication before deferring extraction.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Up to **5%** of patients with a **cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)** develop an infection within **3 years** of implantation.
2. **CIED infection** may involve only the **generator pocket** or extend to the **leads and endocardium**.
3. Any patient with **suspected CIED infection** should be **urgently referred** for specialist evaluation and undergo **blood cultures** and **echocardiography**.
4. **Empiric antibiotics** given **before obtaining blood cultures** can delay or obscure diagnosis of CIED infection.
5. **Diagnostic aspiration** of the device pocket is **contraindicated** because it can introduce infection into a previously sterile pocket.
6. Effective treatment of **confirmed CIED infection** generally requires **complete hardware extraction**, **pocket debridement**, **sustained antibiotic therapy**, and **reimplantation at a new site** after eradication of infection.
7. Patients with **pocket‑limited infection** have **negative blood cultures** and no lead or valve vegetations on **transesophageal echocardiography**; they are treated with **2 weeks** of antibiotics plus **complete device removal**.
8. Patients with **positive blood cultures** for pathogens that cause endocarditis, or with **transesophageal echocardiography evidence** of lead or valve vegetation, require **4–6 weeks** of antibiotic therapy and device removal.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Early recognition of subtle symptoms prevents progression to systemic infection.
2. Common causative organisms include **Staphylococcus aureus**, **coagulase‑negative staphylococci**, **Cutibacterium**, and **Candida** species.
3. Reimplantation at a new site (often contralateral pectoral or subcutaneous/substernal location) avoids residual contaminated tissue.
