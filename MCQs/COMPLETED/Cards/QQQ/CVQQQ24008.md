### 🫀 Coronary Artery Disease: PCI for Stable Angina

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is not superior to **optimal medical therapy** in patients with **stable angina** for reducing **cardiovascular events** such as **mortality** and **myocardial infarction (MI)**.
2. **PCI** is associated with **improved quality of life** by reducing the **severity** and **frequency** of **angina**.
3. **Diagnostic angiography** and **PCI** are reserved for patients with **refractory symptoms** despite **optimal medical therapy**, those who are **unable to tolerate optimal medical therapy** due to adverse effects, or those with **high-risk features** on **noninvasive exercise and imaging tests**.
4. **Supplements** such as **β-carotene**, **selenium**, **chromium**, **vitamin C**, **vitamin E**, and **estrogen** are not associated with improved **cardiovascular outcomes** or **symptom relief** and are not recommended in patients with **ischemic heart disease**.
5. **Cardiac rehabilitation** may be appropriate after **revascularization** but is not the initial treatment for significant **angina symptoms**.
6. **Aspirin** is associated with a decreased risk for **MI**, **stroke**, and **cardiovascular death** in patients with **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
7. **Aspirin** doses of **81 mg to 162 mg daily** are recommended in all patients with established **CAD** unless contraindicated.
8. In patients allergic to **aspirin**, **clopidogrel** is recommended as an alternative.
9. The use of **newer antiplatelet agents** such as **prasugrel** and **ticagrelor** as **monotherapy** has not been tested in patients with **stable angina**.
10. **Dual antiplatelet therapy** for **chronic angina** in the absence of **stent placement** is not recommended.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PCI has not shown mortality or MI benefit over medication in stable angina populations.
2. Angina relief is the primary benefit of PCI in stable patients.
3. These guideline recommendations apply to patients receiving medical therapy yet experiencing ongoing angina or showing high-risk features noninvasively.
4. These agents have been studied and shown no cardiovascular benefit; they are not recommended.
5. Revascularization is the priority in symptom-driven management before considering rehabilitation.
6. Antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone of secondary prevention in CAD.
7. Low-dose aspirin is preferred for its risk-benefit profile.
8. Clopidogrel is a validated alternative from clinical trial data such as CAPRIE.
9. These agents are not guideline-endorsed for use alone in chronic angina without intervention.
10. Combination antiplatelet therapy is reserved for patients with recent interventions or ACS, not stable angina alone.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** comprises several **catheter-based techniques** to improve **coronary blood flow** by relieving **coronary obstruction**.
2. In patients undergoing **PCI**, **drug-eluting stents** are preferred to **bare metal stents** to prevent **restenosis**, **myocardial infarction (MI)**, and **acute stent thrombosis**.
3. **PCI** is indicated to relieve symptoms in patients with **medically refractory angina**, those **unable to tolerate optimal medical therapy**, and those with **high-risk features** on **noninvasive testing**.
4. **PCI** has not been shown to be superior to **guideline-directed medical therapy** in reducing the risk for **death** or **MI** in patients with **stable angina**, unless specific **anatomic or physiologic criteria** for revascularization are present.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These procedures include balloon angioplasty and stent placement.
2. Drug-eluting stents reduce in-stent restenosis and thrombotic complications compared to bare metal alternatives.
3. These indications match those from guidelines when evaluating revascularization candidacy.
4. Revascularization benefit depends on specific findings, such as left main disease or physiologically significant stenosis.
