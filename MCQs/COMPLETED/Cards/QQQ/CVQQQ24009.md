### 🫀 Cardiology: Acute Coronary Syndrome With Atrioventricular Block

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Emergent coronary angiography with possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is indicated in patients with **ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** who develop **second‑degree atrioventricular (AV) block of the Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) pattern**, because timely revascularization treats the infarction and often reverses the conduction deficit.  
2. **Permanent pacemaker implantation** is **not recommended** for **Mobitz type 1 second‑degree AV block** unless **symptomatic or hemodynamically significant bradycardia** persists after correction of reversible causes such as acute myocardial ischemia.  
3. **Intravenous dopamine infusion** is reserved for **hemodynamically unstable bradycardia** and provides no definitive therapy for **AV‑node ischemia**; it is **unnecessary** when a patient with **Mobitz type 1 AV block and STEMI** is stable.  
4. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** should be performed after **myocardial infarction** to evaluate **left ventricular function** and detect structural complications, but it must **not delay emergent reperfusion therapy** in **STEMI** complicated by **AV conduction block**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Restoring blood flow to the AV node by PCI often normalizes conduction; guideline door‑to‑balloon time is ≤90 minutes.
2. Mobitz type 1 block is usually intranodal and transient; pacing is indicated for Mobitz type 2 or persistent high‑grade block.
3. Dopamine can raise heart rate and blood pressure but does not address the culprit coronary occlusion causing the AV block.
4. Early assessment of ejection fraction guides prognosis and secondary prevention, but reperfusion is the time‑critical priority.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI)** should be performed in patients with **ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** who have **ischemic symptoms for <12 hours**, because rapid mechanical reperfusion improves survival.  
2. In patients with **STEMI** complicated by **cardiogenic shock** or **hemodynamic instability**, **PPCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** improves survival **regardless of the time elapsed** since symptom onset.  
3. Systems of care target a **first‑medical‑contact‑to‑balloon time ≤90 minutes** for PPCI in STEMI.  
4. **PPCI** is preferred over **fibrinolytic therapy** when the expected **time from first medical contact to balloon inflation is ≤120 minutes**, including transfer to a PCI‑capable center.  
5. In **hemodynamically stable patients** with **STEMI** and **multivessel coronary artery disease**, **staged PCI of significant non‑infarct artery stenoses** shortly after culprit‑artery PCI reduces cardiovascular death and recurrent myocardial infarction; selected low‑complexity lesions may be treated during the index procedure.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Mechanical reperfusion limits infarct size and preserves left ventricular function.  
2. Revascularization corrects the underlying cause of shock and supports recovery of end‑organ perfusion.  
3. Meeting the 90‑minute benchmark is associated with lower mortality and is a core quality metric.  
4. PPCI achieves higher and more durable vessel patency than fibrinolysis, translating to better outcomes when timely.  
5. Complete revascularization minimizes residual ischemia and recurrent events in multivessel disease.
