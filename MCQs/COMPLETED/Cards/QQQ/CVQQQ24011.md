### 🫠 Cardiology: Drug-Drug Interactions in Stable Angina

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ranolazine**, an antianginal agent, decreases angina symptoms and modestly increases exercise time in patients with **stable angina**.
2. **Ranolazine** is primarily metabolized by **cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)** and should not be used with **strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers**, such as **rifampin**, **carbamazepine**, **ketoconazole**, **clarithromycin**, and **ritonavir**.
3. When **ranolazine** is used with **moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g., **verapamil**, **diltiazem**), the **dose should be reduced by 50%** and should **not exceed 500 mg twice daily**.
4. **Ranolazine** has a **modest QT-prolonging effect** but has **not been associated with proarrhythmic risk**.
5. **Diltiazem**, a **moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor**, can increase plasma concentrations of **atorvastatin**, but no dose adjustment is necessary; **clinical monitoring** is recommended instead.
6. **No significant drug interaction** exists between **lisinopril** and **diltiazem** that would require switching to a different angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.
7. **Long-term β-blocker therapy** (>1 year) may be **reassessed** in patients with **chronic coronary artery disease** who have **no history of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction**, **angina**, **arrhythmias**, or **uncontrolled hypertension**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Ranolazine works by inhibiting the late sodium current, reducing calcium overload and wall tension without affecting blood pressure.
2. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors significantly increases ranolazine serum levels and is contraindicated.
3. The need for dose reduction with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors stems from moderate elevations in ranolazine exposure that can lead to dose-related toxicity.
4. QT prolongation is a theoretical risk, especially when used with other QT-prolonging drugs, so electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered.
5. Diltiazem increases atorvastatin levels by slowing hepatic metabolism, but adverse effects are rare at standard statin doses.
6. Lisinopril, like other ACE inhibitors, does not share metabolic pathways with diltiazem.
7. Evidence does not support continued β-blocker use for cardiovascular event reduction in low-risk patients beyond one year post-myocardial infarction.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **β-Blockers**, **calcium channel blockers**, and **nitrates** are effective **first-line antianginal medications** in patients with **stable chronic angina**.
2. **β-Blockers** relieve angina by **reducing heart rate, myocardial contractility, and blood pressure**, which decreases myocardial oxygen demand.
3. **All β-blockers** are considered **equally effective** for angina relief; selection may depend on **comorbid conditions** such as **left ventricular dysfunction**, **renal impairment**, or **lung disease**.
4. **β1-selective β-blockers**, such as **metoprolol** and **bisoprolol**, are preferred in patients with **lung disease** to minimize respiratory adverse effects.
5. In patients with **reduced left ventricular ejection fraction**, **metoprolol succinate**, **bisoprolol**, and **carvedilol** are associated with **reduced long-term mortality**.
6. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**, such as **verapamil** and **diltiazem**, should be used cautiously with **β-blockers** due to **additive negative inotropic and chronotropic effects**.
7. **Calcium channel blockers** reduce myocardial oxygen demand by lowering **blood pressure** and **contractility**, and improve supply via **coronary vasodilation**.
8. **Short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers**, like **nifedipine**, are avoided in stable angina due to reflex **tachycardia** and **worsened angina**.
9. **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** should **not be used** in patients with **left ventricular dysfunction** due to adverse outcomes from negative inotropy.
10. **Nitrates** reduce **preload** and thereby **lower myocardial oxygen demand** through reduced **ventricular wall stress**.
11. **Reflex tachycardia** from nitrate use can be attenuated by co-administration with **β-blockers or calcium channel blockers**.
12. **A nitrate-free interval** of **8 to 12 hours daily** is necessary to avoid **nitrate tolerance**.
13. **Ranolazine** reduces **wall tension and myocardial oxygen consumption** via **late sodium current inhibition**, improving **exercise tolerance** and **angina** without affecting blood pressure.
14. **Ranolazine** should not be used with **strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**, and **dose reduction is required** with **moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors**, such as **verapamil** and **diltiazem**.
15. **Ivabradine** is not recommended for stable angina in the United States and is limited by side effects such as **bradycardia** and **visual disturbances**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These medications are typically used in stepwise or combination fashion depending on symptom severity.
3. Comorbidity-based tailoring helps reduce side effects while optimizing angina relief.
4. β1-selectivity helps avoid bronchospasm in patients with asthma or COPD.
5. These agents have been validated in trials for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
6. Combining agents that both slow heart rate and reduce contractility can lead to bradycardia or heart block.
8. Reflex sympathetic stimulation from vasodilation can worsen ischemia.
12. Tolerance results in reduced vasodilatory effect and diminished symptom relief.
13. Ranolazine is often used as an add-on in refractory angina.
15. Ivabradine is approved for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but not angina, in the U.S.
