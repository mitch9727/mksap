### 🫠 Cardiology: Early Invasive Strategy in Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)** should undergo **risk stratification** using scoring systems such as the **TIMI** and **GRACE** scores to guide management decisions.
2. An **early invasive strategy** (coronary angiography within 24 hours) is indicated for patients with **high TIMI scores (5–7)**, **intermediate TIMI scores (3–4)**, or a **GRACE score >140**.
3. A **delayed invasive strategy** (within 72 hours) is appropriate for patients with **intermediate risk** (e.g., **GRACE score 109–140**).
4. An **ischemia-guided approach** with **noninvasive stress testing** is appropriate for **low-risk patients** (e.g., **TIMI score <2**, **GRACE score <109**).
5. Patients with **NSTE-ACS** who present with **hemodynamic instability**, **refractory chest pain**, **acute heart failure**, or **ventricular arrhythmias** require **urgent invasive treatment** (within 2 hours).
6. In high-risk patients with **NSTE-ACS**, an **early invasive strategy** improves outcomes such as **death**, **recurrent myocardial infarction (MI)**, and **repeat hospitalization** compared with an ischemia-guided approach.
7. **Thrombolytic therapy** (e.g., **alteplase**) has **no benefit** and is **not recommended** for the treatment of **NSTE-ACS**.
8. **Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)** may be appropriate in patients with suspected **NSTE-ACS**, normal initial **troponin**, and **inconclusive ECG findings**, but it may **delay critical therapy** in high-risk patients.
9. If **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is performed for NSTE-ACS, **staged PCI** or **culprit plus nonculprit lesion intervention** may be performed based on angiographic findings.

#### 💬 Extra
1. TIMI and GRACE scores help predict short-term risk of adverse events such as death or MI.
2. This patient had a **TIMI score of 5** and a **GRACE score of 141**, placing him in the **high-risk category**.
3. Delayed invasive strategy can be safe for patients who do not meet high-risk criteria.
4. Ischemia-guided strategy may include **stress ECG**, **nuclear imaging**, or **CCTA**, typically performed before discharge.
5. These patients represent a critical subgroup where urgent cath may be lifesaving.
6. Data show reduced mortality and morbidity with early revascularization in high-risk NSTE-ACS.
7. Thrombolytics are reserved for ST-elevation MI or cases of NSTE-ACS evolving into STEMI.
8. CCTA is best reserved for low-to-intermediate risk patients when rapid decision-making is not critical.
9. The decision to perform multivessel PCI should be individualized based on clinical stability and lesion complexity.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS)** should undergo **clinical assessment** and **risk stratification** using **TIMI** and **GRACE** scores to guide invasive treatment decisions.
2. The **TIMI risk score** predicts **14-day rates** of **death**, **recurrent myocardial infarction**, and **urgent revascularization** in **NSTE-ACS**.
3. The **GRACE risk score** predicts **in-hospital** and **postdischarge death and recurrent myocardial infarction**, incorporating **clinical**, **ECG**, and **biomarker** findings.
4. **Urgent invasive treatment (within 2 hours)** is recommended for patients with **type 1 NSTE-ACS** and **hemodynamic instability**, **refractory chest pain**, **acute heart failure**, or **ventricular arrhythmias**.
5. For **high-risk NSTE-ACS** (GRACE >140, elevated **troponin**, new **ST depression**), **early invasive strategy (within 24 hours)** improves clinical outcomes.
6. For **intermediate-risk patients** (e.g., GRACE 109–140), a **delayed invasive strategy (within 72 hours)** is appropriate.
7. A **delayed invasive or ischemia-guided approach** is appropriate for **low-risk NSTE-ACS** (TIMI <2, GRACE <109).
8. **Coronary angiography** in **low-risk patients** is typically reserved for those with **ischemia on stress testing** or **persistent angina** despite optimal therapy.
9. **Thrombolytic therapy** is not beneficial and should not be used in **NSTE-ACS**.
10. In **type 2 NSTE-ACS**, **invasive strategies are not indicated**; management focuses on treating the **underlying cause** of increased **myocardial oxygen demand**.
11. The choice between **PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** depends on **coronary anatomy** found during angiography.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Clinical variables such as age, risk factors, and ECG findings are key inputs for risk scores.
2. TIMI is simpler but less comprehensive than GRACE.
3. GRACE includes creatinine and troponin levels, which reflect systemic and myocardial risk.
4. These urgent criteria identify patients at imminent risk of clinical deterioration.
5. Studies show reduced death and MI rates with early invasive strategy in stabilized high-risk patients.
6. Intermediate-risk patients can be safely observed while awaiting angiography.
7. Low-risk patients benefit more from an ischemia-guided approach to avoid unnecessary procedures.
8. Stress testing may include **LV function assessment**, **nuclear perfusion**, or **CCTA**.
9. Guidelines consistently recommend against thrombolytics in NSTE-ACS unless transitioning to STEMI.
10. Type 2 MI typically involves **supply-demand mismatch**, such as anemia or sepsis.
11. Revascularization strategy depends on **lesion location**, **complexity**, and **comorbidities**.
