### 🫠 Heart Failure: Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy for HFrEF

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Guideline-directed medical therapy for **symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** includes treatment with an **angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)**, a **β-blocker**, an **aldosterone antagonist**, and a **sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor**.
2. **SGLT2 inhibitors**, such as **dapagliflozin**, reduce **heart failure hospitalization** and **cardiovascular mortality** in patients with **symptomatic HFrEF**, regardless of **diabetes mellitus** status.
3. **Ivabradine** reduces **heart failure hospitalization** in patients with **HFrEF**, **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%**, **sinus rhythm**, and **resting heart rate ≥70/min** despite **maximally tolerated β-blocker therapy**.
4. **Valsartan-sacubitril**, an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), reduces **cardiovascular death** and **heart failure hospitalization** by 20% compared with **enalapril** in patients with **symptomatic HFrEF** and **LVEF <40%**.
5. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should not be combined with an **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor** because of the increased risk of **angioedema**.
6. A **β-blocker** should not be discontinued in a patient with **HFrEF** who is clinically stable and compensated unless there is a **contraindication or intolerance**.
7. **Ivabradine** should not be used in place of **β-blocker therapy** in **HFrEF** and is indicated only as an **add-on therapy**.
8. **Valsartan-sacubitril** is contraindicated in patients with a **history of angioedema**, or if administered within **36 hours** of an **ACE inhibitor**.
9. **ACE inhibitors**, such as **lisinopril**, reduce **morbidity and mortality** in **HFrEF** and should not be used concurrently with an **ARNI**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. If an ARNI is not tolerated or available, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an alternative.
2. These agents provide benefit regardless of glycemic control and improve outcomes through mechanisms beyond glucose lowering.
3. The benefit of ivabradine is limited to patients meeting specific heart rate and rhythm criteria and already on β-blockers.
4. This was shown in the PARADIGM-HF trial.
5. A washout period of at least 36 hours is required when switching from an ACE inhibitor to valsartan-sacubitril.
6. β-blocker therapy improves left ventricular function and reduces mortality.
7. Ivabradine works by selectively inhibiting the If current in the sinoatrial node to reduce heart rate.
8. Hypotension and angioedema are key safety concerns when combining ARNI and ACE inhibitors.
9. Concurrent use of ACE inhibitor and ARNI increases adverse effects without added benefit.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **ARNIs (angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors)**, **ACE inhibitors**, or **ARBs**, along with **β-blockers**, **aldosterone antagonists**, and **SGLT2 inhibitors**, are first-line therapies for **symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
2. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should be initiated in place of or to replace **ACE inhibitors or ARBs** in patients with **chronic symptomatic HFrEF**, especially with **NYHA class II–IV symptoms** and **LVEF ≤40%**.
3. **Valsartan-sacubitril** should not be used in patients with **hypotension**, **history of angioedema**, or within **36 hours** of an **ACE inhibitor** due to elevated risk for **angioedema**.
4. **SGLT2 inhibitors**, such as **dapagliflozin** and **empagliflozin**, improve **heart failure outcomes** in HFrEF regardless of **diabetes mellitus** status.
5. **Ivabradine** is indicated for **symptomatic HFrEF patients with LVEF ≤35%**, **sinus rhythm**, and **resting heart rate ≥70/min**, already receiving **maximally tolerated β-blocker therapy**.
6. **β-Blockers** should be **initiated at low doses** in **stable patients** with HFrEF and **up-titrated slowly** to the **target or maximally tolerated dose**.
7. **ACE inhibitors** and **ARBs** should not be used if **serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL** or **eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²**.
8. **Aldosterone antagonists** are indicated in **symptomatic HFrEF patients** with **eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, but require **electrolyte monitoring** due to risk of **hyperkalemia**.
9. In **patients with new-onset symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, initiation of **valsartan-sacubitril** is preferred over starting an **ACE inhibitor** or **angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)**.
10. The **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** has expanded the indication for **valsartan-sacubitril** to include **all patients with chronic heart failure**, although the benefit is greatest in those with **reduced ejection fraction**.
11. **Aldosterone antagonists** such as **spironolactone** and **eplerenone** reduce **mortality** and **heart failure hospitalizations** in patients with **NYHA class II–IV HFrEF** and after **acute myocardial infarction**.
12. **Eplerenone**, a selective **aldosterone antagonist**, has a **lower incidence of gynecomastia** and **breast tenderness** than **spironolactone**.
13. **Diuretic therapy** should be **adjusted** when starting **SGLT2 inhibitors** to avoid **volume depletion**, especially in **euvolemic patients**.
14. The combination of **isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine** reduces **mortality** in **Black patients** with **NYHA class III–IV HFrEF** who are already receiving **β-blockers, ACE inhibitors (or ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists**.
15. **Loop diuretics** are preferred over other diuretics for **volume overload** in **heart failure** due to their superior **natriuretic potency**.
16. **Vericiguat**, a soluble **guanylyl cyclase stimulator**, has a **class 2b recommendation** for reducing **heart failure hospitalization and all-cause death** in patients with **HFrEF**, based on the **VICTORIA trial**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. All four drug classes should be started rapidly when tolerated to maximize outcomes.
2. NYHA = New York Heart Association functional classification.
3. The 36-hour window helps reduce risk of life-threatening angioedema when switching from ACE inhibitors to ARNIs.
4. SGLT2 inhibition benefits are independent of glycemic control; dapagliflozin requires eGFR ≥30, empagliflozin ≥20.
5. Ivabradine should not be used unless β-blocker therapy is already maximized.
6. Monitoring includes blood pressure, heart rate, and signs of decompensation during titration.
7. Renal dysfunction limits use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs; clinicians should monitor renal parameters during initiation and dose escalation.
8. Aldosterone antagonists are not diuretics; they should not be used for volume overload.
9. Initiating ARNI therapy earlier may improve outcomes and avoid delays associated with stepped titration.
10. The benefits of ARNI are most clearly supported in reduced LVEF populations; efficacy in preserved ejection fraction is still under investigation.
11. Aldosterone blockade provides neurohormonal inhibition, independent of diuretic effect.
12. Eplerenone is often preferred when gynecomastia is a concern, especially in men.
13. SGLT2 inhibitors promote natriuresis and glycosuria, increasing risk of dehydration if not adjusted for.
14. The original A-HeFT trial demonstrated mortality reduction in Black patients with advanced heart failure.
15. Furosemide is most commonly used, but torsemide and bumetanide may offer improved bioavailability in some cases.
16. Vericiguat is useful in patients already on maximally tolerated heart failure therapy who remain at high risk for events.

    Treatment recommendations for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are displayed. Green indicates a class 1 (strong), yellow a class 2a (moderate), and orange a class 2b (weak) recommendation. Step 1 medications may be started simultaneously at initial (low) doses recommended for HFrEF. Alternatively, these medications may be started sequentially, with sequence guided by clinical or other factors, without the need to achieve target dosing before initiating the next medication. Medication doses should be increased to target as tolerated. Although current guidelines support the use of isosorbide dinitrate–hydralazine in Black patients, making management decisions on the basis of skin color is likely a flawed approach. Questions regarding the underlying studies and the appropriateness of using race to direct management are driving a reevaluation of these recommendations.<br>
