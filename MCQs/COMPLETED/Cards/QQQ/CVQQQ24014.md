### 🫠 Heart Failure: Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The mainstay of therapy for **acute decompensated heart failure** is **intravenous diuretics**.
2. In **acute decompensated heart failure** with **fluid overload**, **loop diuretics** are the principal therapy.
3. **High-dose loop diuretics** (2.5 times the outpatient oral daily dosage) are associated with **increased diuresis** in acute decompensated heart failure.
4. **Rapid up-titration of diuretics** should be performed if the initial response is inadequate to facilitate fluid removal.
5. There is **no difference in clinical outcomes** (length of stay, readmission, kidney function) between **bolus and continuous infusion** strategies of intravenous loop diuretics.
6. **Low-dose dopamine** does **not improve diuresis or kidney function** in acute decompensated heart failure.
7. **Intravenous inotropes**, such as **milrinone** and **dobutamine**, should be considered only in patients with **signs of poor perfusion**.
8. Routine use of **inotropic therapy** in acute heart failure exacerbation has **no benefit**.
9. **Vasodilators** such as **nitroprusside** require **invasive hemodynamic monitoring** and have **uncertain outcome benefit** in acute decompensated heart failure.
1. Diuresis helps relieve volume overload, which is a common cause of hospitalization in heart failure.
3. Although effective, high-dose diuretics may cause transient worsening of kidney function.
5. This conclusion comes from randomized trials comparing administration strategies.
6. The ROSE trial showed no benefit from adding dopamine to diuretic therapy.
8. This is supported by the PROMISE trial, which demonstrated no mortality or hospitalization benefit.

#### ✅ True Statements
10. **β-Blockers** should not be reinitiated in hospitalized patients with heart failure until **signs of low cardiac output** have resolved.
11. In patients admitted for **volume overload** without low cardiac output, **β-blocker therapy may be continued** at the same or reduced dose.
12. **Cardiorenal syndrome** is associated with **abdominal vascular congestion**, **neurohormonal activation**, and **reduced renal perfusion**.
13. If **kidney function worsens** as the patient approaches **euvolemia**, **withholding diuretics for 1 day** may allow fluid to redistribute into the vascular space.
14. **High BNP levels on admission** are associated with **increased mortality and rehospitalization** in acute decompensated heart failure.
15. **BNP levels that fail to decrease** during hospitalization predict **higher postdischarge mortality**.
16. **Troponin elevation** on admission is linked to **worse clinical outcomes and higher mortality** in acute decompensated heart failure.
17. **Invasive hemodynamic monitoring** is appropriate in patients with **persistent or worsening symptoms**, **uncertain hemodynamics**, or **worsening renal function** despite therapy.
18. **Daily monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure** using an implantable sensor has been shown to **reduce hospitalizations** in patients with **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III** heart failure.
19. **Early discharge follow-up within 7 days** improves outcomes in heart failure by addressing **medication reconciliation**, **volume status**, and **patient education**.
10. This ensures patients do not deteriorate from negative inotropy of β-blockade.
11. Continuing therapy supports chronic mortality reduction benefits of β-blockers.
12. These mechanisms contribute to reduced glomerular filtration rate and worsening renal labs.
13. This pause in diuresis helps shift interstitial to intravascular volume for renal perfusion.
14. BNP is a prognostic marker of volume status and neurohormonal activation.
15. A lack of BNP response reflects suboptimal decongestion or ongoing dysfunction.
16. Elevated troponin in heart failure is typically non-ischemic in origin but still prognostically important.
17. Right heart catheterization is an example of such monitoring.
18. These sensors transmit daily pulmonary pressures, enabling preemptive therapy adjustments.
19. Delayed follow-up increases risk of readmission and gaps in heart failure education.
