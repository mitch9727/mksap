### 🫠 Heart Failure: Early Follow-Up to Prevent Readmission

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Early outpatient follow-up within 1 week of hospital discharge** reduces readmission rates in patients hospitalized with acute **heart failure**.
2. Patients should be **euvolemic at discharge**, with **optimized electrolyte levels**, **renal function**, and **guideline-directed medical therapy** at appropriate doses.
3. An early follow-up visit allows **medication review**, **volume status assessment**, **adherence check**, and **reinforcement of heart failure education**.
4. **Ivabradine** is used to reduce hospitalizations in patients with **chronic symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF ≤35%)** in **sinus rhythm** already on guideline-directed therapy.
5. Ivabradine is **not indicated** in patients with **atrial fibrillation** due to the risk of **worsening arrhythmias**.
6. Routine surveillance **echocardiography** is **not recommended** in patients with chronic heart failure unless there is a **change in clinical status** or **planned intervention**.
7. **Aspirin** is not an appropriate substitute for **warfarin** in patients with an elevated **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score**, such as those with heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Studies have shown that patients seen within 1 week after a heart failure hospitalization have reduced readmissions compared with those seen later.
2. Optimizing volume and labs before discharge is critical to prevent recurrence of decompensation.
3. Follow-up includes reinforcing self-management strategies like sodium restriction and medication adherence.
4. Ivabradine is indicated only in select HFrEF patients who are in sinus rhythm and remain symptomatic.
5. Ivabradine can exacerbate atrial fibrillation and should be avoided in patients with this arrhythmia.
6. This patient had an established diagnosis of HFrEF and a clear decompensation trigger (medication nonadherence); therefore, surveillance imaging is unnecessary.
7. The patient’s **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score** of 4 (age, female sex, hypertension, and heart failure) supports continued anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant, not aspirin.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Reversible causes** of heart failure exacerbation should be treated before discharge to prevent readmission.
2. Discharge should only occur after achieving **near-euvolemia** through **diuresis**.
3. **Medication reconciliation** should ensure the patient is discharged on **evidence-based heart failure therapies**.
4. Patients should receive **education** on heart failure physiology, **dietary and medication adherence**, signs of decompensation, and when to seek care.
5. A **home nurse** visit can reinforce education, verify medication accuracy, and monitor patient status after discharge.
6. **Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring** using an implantable sensor has been shown to reduce heart failure hospitalizations in **New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III** patients with prior hospitalization.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Addressing the underlying cause, such as medication nonadherence or dietary indiscretion, reduces the risk of readmission.
2. Achieving euvolemia minimizes the risk of early recurrence of symptoms.
3. Medications should target reduced mortality and morbidity and match home and discharge prescriptions.
4. Education empowers patients to recognize worsening symptoms early and avoid hospitalization.
5. Home nurse visits help identify early signs of decompensation and provide an extra layer of support.
6. Remote monitoring allows daily assessment of pulmonary artery pressures to detect and address hemodynamic worsening.
