### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Infective Endocarditis Prophylaxis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated** for patients with **mitral regurgitation** due to **myxomatous degeneration (mitral valve prolapse)** before dental procedures.
2. **Current guidelines recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis** only for dental procedures involving **manipulation of gingival tissue**, **periapical regions of teeth**, or **perforation of the oral mucosa**, and only in **specific high-risk patients**.
3. **High-risk conditions** for which **infective endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated** include:
   - History of **infective endocarditis**
   - **Cardiac transplantation** with valve regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve
   - **Prosthetic heart valve**, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homografts
   - **Cardiac valve repair** with prosthetic material, including annuloplasty rings, chords, and clips
   - **Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)**
   - **Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease**
   - **Repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects** at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or device
   - **Congenital heart defect repaired with prosthetic material** (surgical or catheter based) within the previous 6 months
4. For patients in whom prophylaxis is indicated, **oral amoxicillin 2 g** taken **30 to 60 minutes** before a dental procedure is the recommended regimen.
5. For patients with a **severe penicillin allergy**, **azithromycin**, **clarithromycin**, or **doxycycline** are acceptable alternatives for prophylaxis.
6. For patients with a **non-severe penicillin allergy**, **cephalexin** or another **first- or second-generation oral cephalosporin** is recommended.
7. **Infective endocarditis prophylaxis is no longer recommended** for a broad population and is now **limited to specific high-risk groups**.
8. **Antimicrobial prophylaxis would not be beneficial** in patients with **mitral valve prolapse–related mitral regurgitation** undergoing dental procedures.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient described has **mitral valve prolapse** and **mitral regurgitation**, which are **no longer considered high-risk** for infective endocarditis per updated guidelines.
2. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was once recommended for a **broader population**, but it is now restricted to only patients with **specific cardiac conditions** undergoing **certain dental procedures**.
3. This list of high-risk indications is consistent across both the **Answer and Critique** and **Related Text**.
4. Oral amoxicillin remains the **first-line agent** unless contraindicated.
5. Severe penicillin allergy includes a history of **anaphylaxis**, **angioedema**, or **urticaria** with penicillin or ampicillin.
6. Cephalosporins are used if the allergy to penicillin is **non-severe** (e.g., rash without systemic symptoms).

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Infective endocarditis is a common complication** of **valvular heart disease**.
2. **Antimicrobial prophylaxis** is only indicated for **high-risk patients** undergoing **dental procedures** involving **manipulation of gingival tissue**, **periapical regions of teeth**, or **perforation of the oral mucosa**.
3. The **same high-risk cardiac conditions** listed in the main text apply for determining **prophylaxis eligibility** before dental procedures.
4. **Cardiac implantable electronic device–related infections** are discussed separately in dedicated guidance on device infections.
5. The **diagnosis and management** of infective endocarditis are covered in sections beyond prophylaxis guidance.

#### 💬 Extra (for Related Text)
1. Endocarditis risk increases in the presence of structural valve disease, especially when turbulence or damage to the endocardium occurs.
2. These procedures create microtrauma or transient bacteremia, which is the rationale for targeting high-risk cardiac conditions.
3. The same list of high-risk indications—prosthetic valves, previous endocarditis, certain congenital heart diseases—is echoed across all guideline-based sources.
4. Device-related infections (e.g., pacemakers, ICDs) are managed under separate protocols because they have distinct microbiologic and procedural risk profiles.
5. Diagnosis and treatment of active infective endocarditis involve blood cultures, imaging (e.g., transesophageal echocardiography), and prolonged intravenous antibiotics or surgery.
