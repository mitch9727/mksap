### 🫠 Aortic Disease: Type A Aortic Dissection Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stanford type A aortic dissections**, which originate in the **ascending aorta**, are associated with high risk of **death and complications** and require **emergent open surgical repair**.
2. The **early mortality rate** of **acute type A aortic dissection** is approximately **1% per hour** after symptom onset.
3. **Acute aortic dissection** typically presents with **sudden-onset chest, back, or abdominal pain** that is described as **tearing or ripping** in quality.
4. Clinical findings of **acute aortic dissection** may include **hypertension**, **syncope**, a **diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation**, **heart failure** from acute aortic insufficiency, **unequal blood pressures** in the upper extremities, and **asymmetric pulses**.
5. **Emergency open surgical repair** is the recommended treatment for **all patients with Stanford type A aortic dissection**.
6. **Coronary angiography** prior to aortic surgery does **not improve in-hospital survival** or reduce the need for **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** and may **delay surgery**.
7. **Medical therapy** for **acute aortic dissection** includes **β-blockers**, **intravenous nitroprusside**, and **opioid analgesia**, but **does not replace surgery** in type A dissections.
8. Surgical management of **type A aortic dissection** may involve **aortic arch reconstruction**, **coronary artery reimplantation**, **aortic valve repair or replacement**, or **branch vessel repair**, depending on the anatomic extent of dissection.
9. **Endovascular stenting** is **not appropriate** for treating **type A aortic dissection** with **branch vessel compromise**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient's CT scan showed a dissection plane extending through the **aortic arch** with diminished right arm blood pressure and pulse, consistent with **right innominate artery compromise** requiring **branch vessel repair**.
6. Preoperative coronary angiography is typically avoided in urgent surgical settings due to **time sensitivity** and lack of survival benefit.
7. While **β-blockers** and **nitroprusside** can help control heart rate and blood pressure, definitive treatment of **type A dissection** is **surgical**.
9. **Endovascular repair** is typically reserved for **type B dissections** or **descending aortic disease**, not proximal ascending pathology.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **acute aortic dissection without shock** should be treated in a **critical care setting** with **heart rate and blood pressure reduction**.
2. Guidelines recommend reducing **systolic blood pressure to ≤120 mm Hg** within **1 hour** for acute aortic dissection.
3. **Intravenous β-blockers** are the **first-line therapy** for acute aortic dissection.
4. If hypertension is not controlled with β-blockers, **intravenous vasodilators** (e.g., **nitroprusside**, **nicardipine**) should be added.
5. **Pain management** with **intravenous opioids** is essential in treating acute aortic syndromes.
6. **Uncomplicated type B acute aortic syndromes** are usually treated with **medical therapy alone**.
7. In **type B aortic dissection**, presence of **refractory chest pain**, **hypertension**, **rapid aortic expansion**, or **organ malperfusion** indicates need for **aortic repair**, typically with **thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)**.
8. In **type A penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers or intramural hematomas**, or those with **aortic enlargement or progression**, **immediate aortic repair** is indicated.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Critical care allows for close hemodynamic monitoring and rapid escalation if needed.
2. Early aggressive blood pressure control reduces risk of progression or rupture.
4. Vasodilators reduce afterload but should not be used alone initially due to risk of increased shear force.
6. Stable cases benefit from lower-risk medical strategies.
7. TEVAR improves aortic-specific outcomes at 5 years but is reserved for complications or progression.
8. Type A lesions pose higher risk and typically require urgent surgical intervention.
