### 🫀 Cardiology: Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation with Coronary Artery Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **atrial fibrillation** and a **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women** should be treated with **oral anticoagulation** to reduce stroke risk.
2. **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**, including **apixaban**, **dabigatran**, **rivaroxaban**, and **edoxaban**, are preferred over **warfarin** for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
3. **Warfarin** is a lower-cost anticoagulant option but requires **frequent INR monitoring** and has **numerous food and drug interactions**.
4. **Aspirin** should be discontinued in patients with atrial fibrillation and no recent coronary intervention or acute coronary syndrome.
5. **Dual antiplatelet therapy** (e.g., **aspirin plus clopidogrel**) is insufficient for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk.
6. **Combination therapy** of a **DOAC plus aspirin** increases bleeding risk and provides no additional stroke prevention benefit unless there is **recent active coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
7. Patients with **CAD and atrial fibrillation** who had **revascularization more than 12 months ago** should be managed with **oral anticoagulation alone**.
8. **Aspirin monotherapy** is inadequate for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** score incorporates factors such as age, sex, hypertension, and vascular disease to estimate stroke risk.
2. DOACs offer improved safety and convenience compared to warfarin, especially in elderly patients.
4. Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy is recommended in stable CAD more than a year out from revascularization or ACS.
6. Antiplatelet agents should only be combined with anticoagulation if there is an **active indication**, such as **recent stenting**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **atrial fibrillation** undergoing **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** for **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**, **triple therapy** (oral anticoagulant + aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) is recommended for 1–4 weeks.
2. After 1–4 weeks of triple therapy, **double therapy** with a **DOAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor** is preferred over continuing triple therapy due to lower bleeding risk.
3. After 12 months, **oral anticoagulation alone** is reasonable for patients with **atrial fibrillation and prior PCI**.
4. In patients with **atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease**, **rivaroxaban monotherapy** is noninferior to **rivaroxaban plus aspirin** for preventing thromboembolic and cardiovascular outcomes and causes less bleeding.
5. Use of **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** is recommended when prescribing **multiple antithrombotic agents** to reduce the risk of **gastrointestinal bleeding**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Triple therapy increases bleeding risk and is reserved for immediate post-PCI period in ACS.
2. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor is used with DOACs during the double therapy phase.
3. Most patients with AF and prior revascularization do not need ongoing antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year.
4. This supports stopping aspirin in stable CAD and using DOAC monotherapy, as in the main case.
5. PPIs mitigate bleeding risk from dual or triple antithrombotic therapy.
