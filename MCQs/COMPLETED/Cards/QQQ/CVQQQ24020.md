### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: TAVI for Severe Aortic Stenosis in High-Risk Patients

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)** is indicated for **symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis** who are at **intermediate or high surgical risk**, as determined through **comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment**.
2. Online tools such as the **Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Risk Calculator** are available to assist in **estimating surgical risk** but do **not account for factors such as frailty**.
3. **Frailty assessment** includes evaluation of **activities of daily living**, **independence in ambulation** (e.g., 6-minute walk distance), and other **geriatric tools**.
4. **Balloon aortic valvuloplasty** may be used as a **bridge to transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement** but does **not improve long-term prognosis** in patients with aortic stenosis.
5. **Medical therapy** does **not slow disease progression** in patients with aortic stenosis and is considered only when valve replacement is not pursued.
6. **Surgical aortic valve replacement** is **not appropriate** for patients with **high surgical risk**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. TAVI is used in lieu of surgery in high-risk patients to reduce procedural complications while maintaining symptom relief and survival benefit.
2. Tools like the STS calculator quantify risk from national surgical data but miss key nonquantitative predictors like frailty.
3. These frailty assessments are crucial for individualized risk stratification, particularly in older adults.
5. Medical therapy may be used in palliative contexts or for symptom control when life expectancy is limited or surgery is declined.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic valve replacement** is a **life-prolonging procedure** in patients with **severe aortic stenosis**.
2. Indications for aortic valve replacement in severe aortic stenosis include **symptoms** (dyspnea, angina, presyncope, syncope, or heart failure) or **concomitant cardiac surgery** for other indications.
3. Aortic valve replacement is **reasonable in asymptomatic patients** with **left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <50%)**, **very severe aortic stenosis (peak velocity ≥5 m/s)** with low surgical risk, **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >3× normal**, or **abnormal supervised exercise testing**.
4. The choice between **TAVI** and **SAVR** is based on symptoms, surgical risk (via multidisciplinary assessment), and shared decision making.
5. For **symptomatic patients aged >80 years**, **TAVI** is recommended over **SAVR**.
6. For **symptomatic patients aged 65 to 80 years**, either **SAVR or TAVI** is appropriate depending on shared decision making.
7. For **symptomatic patients aged <65 years** or those with **life expectancy >20 years**, **SAVR** is preferred due to the **unknown durability of TAVI**.
8. In **asymptomatic patients with decreased left ventricular function**, the recommendations mirror those of symptomatic patients.
9. In **asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk**, **SAVR is preferred to TAVI** when appropriate.
10. **Statins** have been shown to be **ineffective in slowing progression** of aortic stenosis despite its **inflammatory pathophysiology**.
11. For patients with **hypertension or heart failure**, **guideline-directed medical therapy** is recommended.
12. **Balloon valvuloplasty** may be used in select unstable patients as a **bridge to TAVI or SAVR**, but has **limited long-term benefit**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Valve replacement improves survival by relieving outflow obstruction.
2. Cardiac surgery may include CABG or ascending aortic repair in addition to valve replacement.
3. These criteria identify patients at higher risk despite lack of symptoms.
4. This individualized approach aligns with current ACC/AHA guidelines.
5. TAVI offers favorable outcomes with reduced invasiveness in the elderly.
6. Shared decision making accounts for patient values, anatomy, and procedural risks.
7. SAVR is more durable and appropriate for younger patients with long life expectancy.
8. Asymptomatic reduced EF indicates subclinical cardiac decompensation needing intervention.
9. TAVI is typically reserved for higher-risk or older patients in this population.
10. Trials have failed to show benefit of statins in valve calcification regression.
11. This includes ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, and diuretics when clinically indicated.
12. Temporary hemodynamic improvement allows stabilization for definitive intervention.
