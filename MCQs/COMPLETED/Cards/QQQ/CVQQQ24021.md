### 🫠 Cardiovascular Risk: Dyslipidemia and Risk Stratification

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Dyslipidemia** is the **modifiable cardiovascular risk factor** that contributes most significantly to the development of **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** in adults without known ASCVD.
2. The primary clinical purpose of measuring **low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** in patients without known ASCVD is to identify candidates for **risk-reducing therapies** and to assess **treatment response**.
3. Although elevated **triglycerides** and low **high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol** levels are associated with **increased cardiovascular risk**, there is **limited evidence** that improving these levels directly reduces the incidence of **cardiovascular events**.
4. Contemporary **cholesterol treatment guidelines** prioritize **overall atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment** over specific **target lipid thresholds** when determining the need for therapy.
5. A calculated **10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to <7.5%** is considered **borderline risk** according to the **2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol management guideline**.
6. In adults with **borderline 10-year ASCVD risk**, the presence of **risk-enhancing factors** may justify the initiation of **moderate-intensity statin therapy**.
7. **Moderate-intensity statin therapy** typically results in a **30% to 49% reduction** in **LDL cholesterol** levels and is appropriate for primary prevention in select patients.
8. The **ACC/AHA 2018 guideline-defined risk-enhancing factors** include:
   - A **family history of premature ASCVD** (first-degree male relative ≤55 years, female ≤65 years)
   - **LDL cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L)**
   - Presence of **metabolic syndrome**
   - **Chronic kidney disease**
   - **Chronic inflammatory conditions**
   - **History of premature menopause** or **preeclampsia**
   - **South Asian ancestry**
   - **Triglyceride level ≥175 mg/dL (1.98 mmol/L)**
9. In observational studies, **moderate alcohol consumption** (one to two drinks per day for men; one drink per day for women) is associated with a **lower incidence of cardiovascular disease**.
10. **Heavy alcohol consumption**, in contrast, is associated with an **increased risk of cardiovascular disease**.
11. A **family history of premature cardiovascular disease** is an **independent risk factor for ASCVD**, although it typically adds limited discriminatory power to **multivariable risk prediction models**.
12. In risk models, **premature cardiovascular disease** is defined as ASCVD in a **first-degree male relative younger than 55 years** or a **first-degree female relative younger than 65 years**.
13. **Smoking cessation** reduces **cardiovascular risk** significantly within **2 years** of quitting and restores **risk to that of a nonsmoker** after approximately **15 years**.
14. The majority of **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk** in the general population is attributable to **modifiable lifestyle factors**, particularly **dyslipidemia**, **obesity**, and **smoking**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. In a comparative evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors, dyslipidemia accounted for the largest proportion of attributable risk in this patient's context.
5. The patient's calculated **10-year ASCVD risk of 6.9%** places him in the borderline risk category per the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline.
6. The patient had one or more risk-enhancing factors that support initiation of a moderate-intensity statin despite being in the borderline risk range.
11. While the patient's father died of ASCVD, his age at death (61 years) does not meet the definition of "premature" per guideline criteria.
13. This strong risk reduction after cessation highlights the importance of persistent counseling in primary prevention settings.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Approximately **12% of U.S. adults older than 20 years** have **total cholesterol levels greater than 240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L)**.
2. **Elevated total serum cholesterol levels** are associated with **increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)**.
3. Lowering **serum cholesterol levels** has been shown to **reduce overall cardiovascular disease risk**.
4. Both **elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** and **low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol** are independently associated with an **increased risk of cardiovascular disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This population statistic highlights the high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia among U.S. adults and reinforces the need for population-level screening.
3. The risk-lowering effect of cholesterol reduction has been demonstrated in both primary and secondary prevention trials.
