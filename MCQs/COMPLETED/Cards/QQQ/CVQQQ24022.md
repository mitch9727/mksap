### 🫠 Cardiology: Peripheral Artery Disease and Statin Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)** is considered a form of **clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
2. Patients aged 75 years or younger with **ASCVD** should begin **high-intensity statin therapy** unless a contraindication exists.
3. **High-intensity statin therapy** includes **atorvastatin** (40 mg/d or 80 mg/d) and **rosuvastatin** (20 mg/d or 40 mg/d).
4. **Ezetimibe** impairs **intestinal cholesterol absorption** and significantly reduces **low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol** levels when added to statin therapy.
5. **Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors**, such as **evolocumab**, significantly reduce **LDL cholesterol** and are approved as adjunctive therapy in patients with **familial hypercholesterolemia** or **very high-risk ASCVD** who have not reached LDL goals on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.
6. **Treatment with evolocumab** has been associated with reduced risk of **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, **hospitalization for unstable angina**, and **coronary revascularization**, but not with reduced **cardiovascular or all-cause mortality**.
7. **Moderate-intensity statin therapy** is not the first-line treatment in patients aged 75 years or younger with **clinical ASCVD**; it is an option in patients older than 75 years or those with contraindications to high-intensity statins.

#### 💬 Extra
1. An ankle–brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90 is diagnostic for PAD and confirms the presence of ASCVD.
2. Ezetimibe is not appropriate as monotherapy in patients not already taking a statin.
5. Very high-risk ASCVD is defined as multiple ASCVD events or one event with multiple risk factors, and an LDL cholesterol level ≥70 mg/dL or non–HDL cholesterol ≥100 mg/dL despite maximal therapy.
6. Despite improvements in nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes, PCSK9 inhibitors like evolocumab have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in clinical trials.
7. The benefit of high-intensity statins outweighs moderate-intensity options in patients ≤75 years with ASCVD due to superior LDL lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)** is a qualifying condition for **secondary prevention** of **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**.
2. **High-intensity statin therapy** should be initiated in patients aged 75 years or younger with **ASCVD** to achieve ≥50% reduction in **LDL cholesterol**.
3. If **high-intensity statin therapy** is contraindicated or not tolerated, **moderate-intensity statin therapy** should be used to achieve a 30%–49% reduction in **LDL cholesterol**.
4. If LDL cholesterol remains ≥70 mg/dL on statin therapy alone, **ezetimibe** should be added.
5. If LDL goals remain unmet after adding **ezetimibe**, a **PCSK9 monoclonal antibody** may be considered.
6. **Patients with very high risk ASCVD** (multiple ASCVD events or one ASCVD event plus multiple high-risk conditions) may benefit from **nonstatin therapy** in addition to **maximally tolerated statin therapy**.
7. **Bempedoic acid** or **inclisiran** may be considered if LDL cholesterol remains elevated after ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitor use.
8. The **American Diabetes Association (ADA)** recommends **high-intensity statin therapy** for all patients with **diabetes** and **ASCVD**.
9. The **U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs** and **Department of Defense cholesterol guideline** recommends **moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy** in ASCVD patients and considers **nonstatin therapies** in high-risk individuals.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Secondary prevention includes patients with ACS, prior MI, stable/unstable angina, stroke, TIA, PAD, and aortic aneurysm.
5. PCSK9 monoclonal antibody cost has decreased, improving its cost-effectiveness.
7. These newer agents are options for patients with statin intolerance or extremely high baseline LDL levels.
8. This is consistent with AHA/ACC guidelines and emphasizes diabetes as a major ASCVD risk enhancer.
9. High-risk criteria include recent MI, recurrent vascular events, or additional risk factors like diabetes or CKD.
