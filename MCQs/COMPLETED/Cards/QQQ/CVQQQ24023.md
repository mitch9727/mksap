### 🫠 Peripheral Artery Disease: Critical Limb Ischemia Revascularization

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)**, also known as **critical limb ischemia**, is a severe form of **peripheral artery disease (PAD)** characterized by **ischemic rest pain** and **tissue ulceration**.
2. **Clinical signs** of CLTI include a **cool extremity**, **hair loss**, **dependent rubor**, and **tissue ulceration**.
3. An **ankle-brachial index (ABI)** less than **0.40**, a **flat waveform** on **pulse volume recording**, and **low or absent pedal flow** on **duplex ultrasound** indicate the need for **urgent revascularization**.
4. In patients with **CLTI**, **immediate invasive angiography** with the intent to **revascularize** is often the most effective strategy to preserve **tissue viability**.
5. **Invasive angiography** is the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic next step in patients with **CLTI** and signs of **viable limb ischemia**.
6. **Revascularization** in CLTI significantly reduces the **1-year risk for major amputation** compared with no revascularization.
7. **Antiplatelet monotherapy** with **aspirin** or **clopidogrel** is recommended for patients with **PAD** to reduce the risk of **myocardial infarction**, **stroke**, and **peripheral arterial events**.
8. There is **no compelling evidence** for the use of **dual antiplatelet therapy** with **aspirin plus clopidogrel** in patients with **PAD alone**.
9. **Vorapaxar**, a thrombin receptor antagonist, has not shown a **net clinical benefit** in patients with PAD due to its increased **bleeding risk**.
10. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** may delay treatment in patients with **CLTI** and should not be performed when **urgent revascularization** is indicated.

#### 💬 Extra
1. CLTI is also referred to as critical limb ischemia in guideline and clinical contexts.
3. These vascular findings are diagnostic thresholds suggesting severe PAD needing urgent intervention.
5. This approach is indicated even if ABI is unobtainable, when clinical findings strongly suggest CLTI.
7. The goal of antiplatelet therapy is secondary prevention of cardiovascular and limb events.
9. In the TRA 2°P–TIMI 50 trial, vorapaxar reduced hospitalizations for acute limb ischemia but increased bleeding risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Revascularization** is not recommended in **asymptomatic patients** with **peripheral artery disease**.
2. **Endovascular or surgical revascularization** is effective in relieving **symptoms**, improving **functional capacity**, and promoting **wound healing** in patients with **intermittent claudication** or **chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)**.
3. Patients with **life-limiting claudication** who have failed **exercise training**, **antiplatelet therapy**, and **cilostazol** should be referred for **revascularization**.
4. Patients with **rest pain**, **ulceration**, or **gangrene** should be considered for **revascularization**.
5. Some patients with **CLTI**, defined by **ABI <0.40**, **flat waveform** on **pulse volume recording**, and **low or absent pedal flow**, require **urgent revascularization**.
6. Revascularization decisions should involve a **multidisciplinary team**, including **vascular surgery**, **radiology**, **cardiology**, and/or **podiatry**.
7. The choice of **revascularization strategy** should consider **patient factors** (age, frailty, comorbidities), **anatomic factors**, **operator expertise**, and **procedure type**.
8. **Endovascular revascularization** is preferred for **proximal and focal lesions** due to lower **perioperative risk**.
9. **Surgical revascularization** is preferred for **complex anatomy**, such as **long chronic total occlusions** or **multisegment disease**, particularly in **CLTI**.
10. **Hybrid revascularization**, combining surgical and endovascular techniques, is used more frequently but is **not currently guideline-recommended**.
11. In **isolated iliac disease**, **balloon angioplasty with stenting** is favored over surgery due to higher **long-term success rates**.
12. In **infrainguinal disease** (femoral, popliteal, or tibial arteries), **endovascular patency rates** are lower, but evolving technologies like **atherectomy** and **drug-eluting stents** are being evaluated.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Revascularization not only relieves ischemic symptoms but also promotes healing in ischemic ulcers.
6. Team-based decision-making aligns with current PAD management guidelines.
8. Minimally invasive procedures are generally safer in elderly or frail patients.
10. Despite increased use, hybrid revascularization lacks formal endorsement in current guidelines.
12. Newer devices aim to improve outcomes in more distal, challenging lesions.
