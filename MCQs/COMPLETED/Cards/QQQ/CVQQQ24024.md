### 🫠 Vascular Disease: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Surveillance

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs)** with a diameter smaller than **4.0 cm** have an estimated **5-year rupture risk of 2%**.
2. **Repeat abdominal aortic ultrasonography** every **2 to 3 years** is appropriate surveillance for **asymptomatic AAAs <4.0 cm** in diameter.
3. The **Society for Vascular Surgery** recommends a **3-year surveillance interval** for AAAs measuring **3.0 to 4.0 cm** in both men and women.
4. For **AAA diameters of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in men**, or **4.0 to 4.4 cm in women**, **surveillance imaging is recommended annually**.
5. For **AAA diameters of 5.0 to <5.5 cm in men**, or **4.5 to <5.0 cm in women**, **surveillance imaging should occur every 6 months**.
6. **Surgical or endovascular repair** is indicated when **AAA diameter reaches 5.5 cm in men** or **5.0 cm in women** due to elevated rupture risk.
7. **AAA repair is also indicated** in patients with **symptoms** (e.g., abdominal tenderness or pain) or **rapid aneurysm expansion** (>0.5 cm/year).
8. **Computed tomography (CT) angiography** is used to define the **anatomic location** of the AAA (suprarenal, juxtarenal, or infrarenal) during **preoperative planning**, not routine surveillance.
9. **Discontinuing surveillance** of an asymptomatic patient with AAA is inappropriate due to the ongoing **risk of rupture and death**.
10. **Surveillance ultrasonography** is recommended for **men with AAA <5.5 cm** and **women with AAA <5.0 cm**, with imaging interval determined by **aneurysm size**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The low rupture risk of small aneurysms allows for safe, infrequent monitoring.
2. There is no single optimal surveillance interval defined by trials, but consensus recommendations guide timing.
3. Society recommendations are based on expert opinion in the absence of large randomized trials.
4. Annual surveillance balances detection of aneurysm growth with avoidance of excessive testing.
5. Shorter intervals for larger aneurysms detect rapid changes that may require surgical intervention.
6. Aneurysms ≥5.5 cm (men) or ≥5.0 cm (women) present significant risk of rupture, justifying repair.
7. Symptom presence or rapid growth increases rupture risk even if below standard surgical thresholds.
8. CT angiography offers detailed imaging required before surgery but is not needed for initial or routine follow-up.
9. Ongoing surveillance prevents missed opportunities for timely intervention as aneurysms grow.
10. The surveillance interval is tiered based on maximum aneurysm diameter, stratified by sex.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** is defined as **abnormal dilatation of the abdominal aorta** with an **anteroposterior diameter >3.0 cm**.
2. Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) include **male sex**, **advanced age**, **smoking**, **atherosclerosis**, **hypertension**, and **family history of AAA**.
3. Most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are **diagnosed incidentally** by **computed tomography angiography (CTA)** or **abdominal ultrasonography**.
4. **Approximately 75%** of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are **asymptomatic** at the time of diagnosis.
5. **One-time screening with duplex ultrasonography** is recommended in **men aged 65–75 years** who have **ever smoked**.
6. For men aged 65–75 who have **never smoked**, **selective screening** for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is recommended.
7. In patients with AAA diameter **<4.0 cm**, **surveillance** with duplex ultrasonography is recommended every **2 to 3 years**.
8. For AAA diameters of **4.0–4.9 cm**, surveillance imaging should be performed every **12 months**.
9. In men with AAA diameters of **5.0 to <5.5 cm**, surveillance imaging is recommended every **6 months**.
10. Aortic repair is indicated for AAA when the diameter is **≥5.5 cm in men** or **≥5.0 cm in women**, or if there is **rapid growth >0.5 cm in 6 months**, or if **symptoms** such as **abdominal or back pain** are present.
11. In patients with indication for repair, **suprarenal and juxtarenal AAAs** typically require **open surgical repair**.
12. Infrarenal AAAs may be treated with either **open surgical repair** or **endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)**, depending on **patient factors**.
13. **EVAR** has **lower 30-day morbidity and mortality** than open surgery, but shows **no difference in long-term mortality**.
14. **EVAR** has higher rates of **repeat interventions**, **endoleak**, **device failure**, and **postimplantation syndrome**.
15. Patients undergoing EVAR require **annual follow-up** with **CTA or ultrasonography** to assess **stent graft integrity**.
16. The **annual rupture risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** measuring **<4.0 cm** is **<0.5%**.
17. The **annual rupture risk of an AAA** measuring **4.0–4.9 cm** is **0.5% to 5%**.
18. The **annual rupture risk of an AAA** measuring **5.0–5.9 cm** is **3% to 15%**.
19. The **annual rupture risk of an AAA** measuring **6.0–6.9 cm** is **10% to 20%**.
20. The **annual rupture risk of an AAA** measuring **7.0–7.9 cm** is **20% to 40%**.
21. The **annual rupture risk of an AAA** measuring **≥8.0 cm** is **30% to 50%**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The standard diagnostic threshold of >3.0 cm helps differentiate aneurysmal from ectatic aortic segments.
2. The male predominance is approximately 6:1.
5. The USPSTF recommends one-time screening based on smoking history due to rupture risk.
7–9. Surveillance intervals vary based on AAA size to monitor growth and rupture risk.
10. Rapid expansion or symptoms such as pain warrant surgical evaluation regardless of size.
13. EVAR is less invasive but not curative and requires ongoing surveillance.
14. Postimplantation syndrome includes inflammatory symptoms like leukocytosis and fever.
16–21. These rupture risks are size-dependent and reflect the exponential increase in rupture risk as aneurysms enlarge beyond 5.0 cm, forming the basis for repair thresholds in clinical guidelines.
