### 🦵 Peripheral Artery Disease: Arterial Ulcers and Revascularization

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Arterial leg ulcers** typically appear in areas of limited arterial redundancy and present with a **well-demarcated edge**, **dry and "punched out" appearance**, and a **pale or necrotic base**.
2. **Diminished pulses**, **elevation pallor**, and **elevation pain** are signs of reduced arterial blood flow in peripheral artery disease.
3. The most effective treatment for **arterial ulcers** is to pursue **revascularization**, either through **endovascular procedures** or **open bypass surgery**.
4. General management of ulcers includes **wound debridement**, **infection control**, **dressings**, and **off-loading pressure**.
5. **Amputation** is not indicated for arterial ulcers unless there is **life-threatening limb ischemia** or **severe wound-related sepsis**.
6. **Graded-pressure compression therapy** is not appropriate for **arterial ulcers** and is used instead for **venous leg ulcers**.
7. **Venous ulcers** are typically located near the **medial malleolus** and are associated with **venous dermatitis**, **pigment deposition**, and **aching pain that improves with leg elevation**.
8. **Topical recombinant human epidermal growth factor** may assist healing in **diabetic foot ulcers**, but **revascularization** should be considered first in arterial ulcers.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The ulcer description is consistent with ischemic etiology, which lacks adequate collateral circulation.
2. These signs are clinical indicators of inadequate perfusion to the distal extremities.
3. Vascular surgery evaluation helps determine candidacy for either open or endovascular procedures based on anatomy and risk.
4. Supportive care is necessary but insufficient without restoring blood flow in arterial ulcers.
5. This applies to non-critical limb ischemia presentations without infection or gangrene.
6. Compression therapy can worsen ischemia in arterial disease by further reducing perfusion.
7. These characteristics differentiate venous from arterial ulcers.
8. Growth factors are not first-line treatment and should not delay assessment for revascularization.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Revascularization** is not recommended in **asymptomatic patients** with peripheral artery disease.
2. **Endovascular or surgical revascularization** improves **symptoms**, **functional capacity**, and **wound healing** in patients with **intermittent claudication** or **chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)**.
3. Revascularization is indicated for **life-limiting claudication** unresponsive to **exercise training**, **antiplatelet therapy**, and **cilostazol**.
4. Patients with **rest pain**, **ulceration**, or **gangrene** should be evaluated for **revascularization**.
5. Patients with **CLTI**, an **ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.40**, **flat pulse volume recordings**, or **absent pedal flow** on duplex ultrasonography may require **urgent revascularization**.
6. Revascularization decisions should be made by a **multidisciplinary team**, including experts in **vascular surgery**, **radiology**, **cardiology**, or **podiatry**.
7. **Endovascular revascularization** has lower **perioperative risk** and includes techniques such as **balloon angioplasty**, **stenting**, and **atherectomy**.
8. **Endovascular therapy** is preferred for **isolated iliac disease**, while **surgical revascularization** is better for **long, multisegment, or distal lesions**.
9. **Hybrid revascularization** combines surgical and endovascular methods but is **not currently guideline-recommended**.
10. **Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)** is defined by the presence of **rest pain**, **ulceration**, or **gangrene** in the setting of **peripheral artery disease**.
11. **Flat waveforms on pulse volume recordings** and **low or absent pedal flow** on duplex ultrasonography are diagnostic features supporting **CLTI**.
12. **More proximal and focal arterial lesions** are typically better managed with **endovascular techniques**.
13. **Surgical bypass or endarterectomy** is preferred over endovascular therapy for **long chronic total occlusions** or **multisegment arterial disease**.
14. The rise of **endovascular procedures** has increased dramatically due to **minimally invasive nature** and **lower perioperative risk**.
15. **Nickel-titanium stents** and **atherectomy devices** are being increasingly evaluated for **infrainguinal arterial disease**.
16. **Multidisciplinary revascularization decisions** must consider **patient comorbidities**, **anatomic complexity**, **procedural risk**, and **operator expertise**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Lack of symptoms suggests adequate perfusion, negating procedural risk-benefit advantage.
2. These interventions target perfusion improvement to promote tissue viability.
3. Conservative therapy must fail before invasive interventions are justified.
4. These are hallmark features of CLTI requiring prompt evaluation.
5. These hemodynamic and imaging findings support a diagnosis of advanced PAD.
6. Multidisciplinary review helps optimize therapy selection and procedural success.
7. Endovascular options are increasingly favored due to minimally invasive nature.
8. Anatomical complexity often dictates the preferred approach.
9. Although used in practice, guidelines do not endorse hybrid techniques due to limited evidence.
10. CLTI is the most advanced form of peripheral artery disease requiring urgent intervention.
11. These findings help stratify severity and guide revascularization urgency.
12. Endovascular treatment is more successful in short-segment, large-vessel disease.
13. Surgical methods maintain better long-term patency in complex or distal anatomy.
14. These procedures include balloon angioplasty, bare-metal or drug-eluting stents, and atherectomy.
15. These novel devices may improve outcomes in challenging tibial or popliteal artery lesions.
16. Age, frailty, renal function, and procedural expertise influence procedural selection.
