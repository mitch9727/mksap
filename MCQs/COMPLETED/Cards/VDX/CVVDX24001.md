### 🫀 Cardiac Arrhythmias: Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)** is most commonly seen in **acutely ill patients**, especially in the setting of **pulmonary disease** such as **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** exacerbation.
2. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** findings in MAT include **at least three different P-wave morphologies**, **varying P–P, P–R, and R–R intervals**, and a **heart rate >100/min**.
3. **MAT** is distinguished from **atrial fibrillation** by the presence of **discernible P waves** and a **1:1 P wave to QRS complex relationship**.
4. **MAT** is distinguished from **wandering atrial pacemaker** by a **heart rate greater than 100/min**.
5. The morphologic features of **P waves in MAT** are best seen in **leads II, III, and V1** on ECG.
6. **Treatment of MAT** focuses on correcting the **underlying disease**, as the arrhythmia is often **refractory or recurrent** without it.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Associated factors include **hypoxia** and **electrolyte abnormalities**.
2. These ECG characteristics help differentiate MAT from **junctional tachycardia**, which lacks P-wave morphology variation.
3. Unlike in atrial fibrillation, **MAT has organized atrial activity**.
4. **Wandering atrial pacemaker** is defined by similar P-wave variability but occurs at a **slower heart rate**.
6. Common contributors to recurrence include **untreated pulmonary pathology** and **metabolic disturbances**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are early, isolated atrial beats that are **exceedingly common** and increase in frequency with **age**.
2. **High PAC burden** is associated with increased risk for **atrial fibrillation (AF)**.
3. **Symptomatic PACs** are typically treated with **β-blockers** or **calcium channel blockers**.
4. **Atrial tachycardia** originates from an **atrial site other than the sinus node** and has a rate **greater than 100/min**.
5. **First-line treatment** for **symptomatic atrial tachycardia** includes **β-blockers** or **calcium channel blockers**.
6. **Second-line treatments** for atrial tachycardia include **catheter ablation** or **antiarrhythmic drug therapy**.
7. **Catheter ablation success rates** are generally **lower in atrial tachycardia** compared to other **supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs)**.
8. **Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)** is characterized by **three or more P-wave morphologies** and a **heart rate >100/min**.
9. MAT is usually seen in patients with **severe pulmonary disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Only 1% of individuals monitored via ambulatory ECG have no PACs.
2. PAC burden has prognostic implications for **AF development**.
3. Medication choice depends on **symptom severity** and comorbid conditions.
4. Atrial tachycardia may be **paroxysmal** or **sustained**, with or without **structural heart disease**.
5. Rate control is typically **sufficient for symptom management** in atrial tachycardia.
6. Catheter ablation is reserved for **refractory or intolerant cases**.
7. This may reflect the **diffuse atrial foci** and **non-reentrant mechanisms** of atrial tachycardia.
8. P-wave variability is essential to distinguish MAT from other **irregular rhythms**.
9. Severe pulmonary disease includes conditions like **COPD**, **asthma**, or **hypoxia**.
