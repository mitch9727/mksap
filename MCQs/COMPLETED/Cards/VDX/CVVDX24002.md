### 🫀 Arrhythmias: Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) on ECG

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left bundle branch block (LBBB)** is characterized by a **QRS duration ≥120 milliseconds**.
2. **LBBB** shows an **upright monophasic or notched QRS complex in leads I and V6**.
3. **LBBB** shows a **predominantly negative QRS complex in lead V1**.
4. In both **left and right bundle branch blocks**, **ST-T wave abnormalities** typically occur in the **opposite direction** of the main QRS vector and are **secondary to the conduction abnormality**.
5. **ST-T changes** in bundle branch block do **not imply additional underlying pathology**.
6. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is typically distinguished from bundle branch block by a **rate >100/min**, **atrioventricular dissociation**, and the **absence of typical bundle branch block morphology**.

#### 💬 Extra
1–3. These three ECG features collectively define **LBBB morphology** and help differentiate it from other wide QRS conditions.
4–5. Secondary repolarization abnormalities (ST-T changes) are expected in bundle branch blocks and should not be misinterpreted as ischemia.
6. **VT** may resemble a bundle branch block on ECG, but can be distinguished based on rate and atrioventricular conduction features.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block** is defined as a **PR interval >200 milliseconds**.
2. **First-degree AV block** is associated with increased risk for **atrial fibrillation (AF)** and **all-cause mortality**, despite being usually asymptomatic.
3. **Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block (Wenckebach)** is characterized by **progressive PR prolongation** until a **dropped QRS complex**.
4. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** involves **intermittent nonconducted P waves** with **constant PR intervals**.
5. **Mobitz type 2** occurs below the AV node and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
6. **Third-degree AV block (complete heart block)** is defined by **no P waves conducting to the ventricles**, leading to **AV dissociation**.
7. **High-degree AV block** refers to multiple consecutive **nonconducted P waves**.
8. **Infranodal conduction disease** includes **Mobitz type 2**, **third-degree AV block**, and **bundle branch blocks**.
9. **Left or right bundle branch block**, as well as **fascicular blocks**, may reflect **significant underlying heart disease**, particularly if progressive.
10. **Surface ECG changes** such as QRS morphology alterations should be evaluated in context of **symptoms** and **cardiovascular history**.
11. **First-degree AV block** is defined by a **PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds** and is typically asymptomatic.
12. First-degree AV block is associated with an **increased risk of atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality**.
13. **Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block** is characterized by **progressive prolongation of the PR interval** until a **nonconducted P wave** results in a **dropped QRS complex**.
14. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** is characterized by **intermittent nonconducted P waves with a fixed PR interval**.
15. **2:1 AV block** cannot reliably distinguish between Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2.
16. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically occurs **below the AV node** and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
17. **High-degree AV block** refers to more than one consecutive nonconducted P wave, with **several P waves not followed by QRS complexes**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Cohort studies have linked first-degree AV block to **long-term adverse outcomes** despite being a benign ECG finding.
5. Mobitz type 2 is considered **high risk** and may require pacing even if asymptomatic.
8–9. Bundle branch blocks alone are not equivalent to high-grade AV block, but **progressive conduction abnormalities** suggest possible **structural or ischemic heart disease**.
11. A PR interval >200 ms signifies delayed AV conduction but does not affect all ventricular depolarizations.
12. Longitudinal studies support increased morbidity despite lack of immediate symptoms in first-degree AV block.
13. Grouped beating is a key visual feature of Mobitz type 1 on ECG.
14. Mobitz type 2 may appear similar to 2:1 block but has fixed PR intervals and sudden dropped beats.
15. In 2:1 block, every other P wave fails to conduct, making classification difficult without additional evidence.
16. Mobitz type 2 often originates in or below the His-Purkinje system and warrants close monitoring or pacemaker evaluation.
17. High-degree block is often a prelude to third-degree block and represents advanced conduction disease.

  <figcaption>
    P waves are blocked intermittently (arrows), and the PR interval is fixed. Although 2 : 1 block can be a manifestation of Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block, note the wide QRS complexes, which are more consistent with block below the compact atrioventricular node.

  <figcaption>
    The tracing shows right bundle branch block with evidence of disease elsewhere in the conduction system, including borderline PR interval and possibly left posterior fascicular block. The latter findings indicate disease in the left bundle branch system also (and possibly the His bundle). In summary, this patient’s atrioventricular conduction is “hanging by a thread.”
