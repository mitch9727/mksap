### 🫀 Cardiology: Atrial Fibrillation ECG Identification

#### ✅ True Statements
1. An **irregularly irregular rhythm** on electrocardiogram (ECG) with **no discernible P waves** is characteristic of **atrial fibrillation**.
2. **Atrial flutter** typically demonstrates a **sawtooth pattern** with **inverted flutter waves** in **leads II, III, and aVF** and **positive flutter waves** in **lead V1**.
3. **Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)** is typically characterized by a **short RP interval** and a **retrograde P wave** inscribed very close to the **QRS complex**.
4. **Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)** typically shows **shortening of the PR interval** and **slurring of the initial QRS complex** due to conduction over an **accessory pathway**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These ECG features distinguish atrial fibrillation from other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.
2. AVNRT and AVRT are common forms of **paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)** but have more regular rhythm patterns.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial fibrillation (AF)** is the **most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia** encountered in clinical practice.
2. The **lifetime probability of developing AF is about 25 % for individuals older than 40 years**, and the annual incidence of AF increases steadily with age.
3. AF confers an **independent elevation in risk for ischemic stroke, incident heart failure, and dementia**.
4. Long-standing **modifiable risk factors** for AF include **diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and obstructive sleep apnea**.
5. Structured **lifestyle-modification programs** that promote **greater physical activity, intentional weight loss, smoking cessation, and abstinence from alcohol** reduce incident AF in at-risk populations.
6. **Routine caffeine restriction is unnecessary** for primary prevention of atrial fibrillation.
7. **Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery** reduces arrhythmia burden and should be considered in **eligible obese patients** to lower future AF risk.
8. **Optimal control of blood pressure, improvement in glycemic control, and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea** each decrease the likelihood of incident AF.
9. Acute or reversible precipitants of AF include **pulmonary embolism, severe critical illness (e.g., sepsis), and untreated hyperthyroidism**.
10. When no modifiable triggers are identified, a **heritable genetic predisposition** is often present in new-onset AF.
11. **Post-operative AF** occurring within days of cardiac surgery is common, usually reversible, and does **not necessarily predict progression to chronic AF**.
12. The symptom spectrum of AF ranges from **asymptomatic** to **palpitations, light-headedness, dizziness, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, fatigue, chest pain, near-syncope, or syncope**.
13. AF can precipitate **acute hemodynamic compromise** in patients with **advanced diastolic dysfunction or restrictive cardiomyopathy**.
14. **Persistent rapid ventricular response** during AF can cause **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy** or precipitate overt heart failure.
15. Among adults aged **≥ 55 years** who experience an **ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of undetermined source**, occult AF is present in **up to 25 % of cases**.
16. **Fourteen- to 30-day continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring** is recommended after cryptogenic stroke to detect previously unrecognized AF.
17. If extended ambulatory monitoring fails to identify AF, **implantation of a subcutaneous loop recorder** is reasonable for longer-term rhythm surveillance.
18. **Evidence is lacking** that empiric anticoagulation improves outcomes solely on the basis of **silent AF discovered after cryptogenic stroke**.
19. Clinical staging of AF recognizes **paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, and permanent** forms, reflecting a progressive disease continuum.
20. **Paroxysmal AF** terminates spontaneously within **7 days** of onset, whereas **persistent AF** lasts **≥ 7 days or requires cardioversion** to restore sinus rhythm.
21. **Long-standing persistent AF** is continuous for **> 1 year**, and **permanent AF** describes cases in which both physician and patient have decided to abandon rhythm-control efforts.
22. Every newly diagnosed AF patient should undergo **thyroid-stimulating hormone testing** to screen for **hyperthyroidism**.
23. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is indicated at AF diagnosis to evaluate **cardiac structure, ventricular function, valvular disease, and left-atrial size**.
24. Patients with risk factors for or symptoms suggestive of **obstructive sleep apnea** should undergo formal sleep testing after an AF diagnosis.
25. **Urgent electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion** is indicated when AF with rapid ventricular response causes **hypotension, acute myocardial ischemia, or decompensated heart failure**.
26. For AF or flutter of **> 48 hours duration (or unknown duration)** requiring immediate cardioversion, **therapeutic anticoagulation must begin promptly and continue for ≥ 4 weeks**.
27. In hemodynamically **stable AF**, primary therapeutic goals are **stroke prevention, ventricular-rate control, symptom relief, and modification of underlying risk factors**.
28. When elective cardioversion is planned and AF duration is **< 48 hours**, **pre- and post-procedural anticoagulation** is recommended for **men with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 and women with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 3**.
29. If AF duration is **> 48 hours or uncertain**, at least **3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation** is recommended before cardioversion.
30. **Transesophageal echocardiography, contrast-enhanced cardiac CT, or cardiac MRI** can rule out **left-atrial-appendage thrombus** and allow expedited cardioversion in anticoagulated patients.
31. All patients with AF of **≥ 48 hours duration or unknown duration** who undergo cardioversion must **continue anticoagulation for ≥ 4 weeks** post-procedure.
32. The immediate target **ventricular-rate goal** in acute AF management is **60 – 110 beats min⁻¹**.
33. **Intravenous or oral β-blockers** and **non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil)** are first-line agents for acute ventricular-rate control in AF.
34. **Non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers** should be **avoided** for rate control in AF patients with **left-ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50 %)**.
35. **Digoxin** is useful as **adjunctive therapy** to improve rate control in AF, particularly in patients with **heart failure or low blood pressure**.
36. **Arterial thromboembolism** is the most serious complication of AF and may occur in **paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent** forms of the arrhythmia.
37. In **non-valvular AF**, the presence of **heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or vascular disease** increases thromboembolism risk **\~15–20-fold**.
38. The **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score** should guide anticoagulation in non-valvular AF but is **not applicable** to **valvular AF** (moderate/severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valve) or **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**.
39. The **2023 ACC/AHA/HRS focused update** recommends chronic oral anticoagulation for non-valvular AF when **CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women**, while allowing additional factors (e.g., chronic kidney disease) to influence decisions.
40. **American College of Chest Physicians guidelines** suggest initiating anticoagulation in non-valvular AF when **≥ 1 non-sex stroke-risk factor is present** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 1 in men or ≥ 2 in women).
41. **Antiplatelet monotherapy** (e.g., aspirin alone) is **no longer recommended** for primary stroke prevention in AF.
42. In eligible patients with non-valvular AF, **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** are **preferred over warfarin** for stroke prevention.
43. **Warfarin** remains the anticoagulant of choice for **valvular AF** associated with **moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic heart valves**.
44. The effectiveness and safety of warfarin depend on maintaining an **INR of 2.0–3.0**, necessitating **regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment**.
45. Four DOACs—**dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor)** and the factor-Xa inhibitors **rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban**—are approved for stroke prevention in AF.
46. **Dabigatran and rivaroxaban** are associated with **higher gastrointestinal-bleeding rates** than warfarin, and **dabigatran** can cause **dyspepsia**.
47. Life-threatening bleeding from factor-Xa inhibitors should be treated with **andexanet alfa** or, if unavailable, **four-factor prothrombin-complex concentrate**.
48. **Idarucizumab** is a monoclonal antibody fragment that **rapidly reverses dabigatran** anticoagulation in emergencies.
49. **Baseline and annual assessment of renal and hepatic function** is required when prescribing any DOAC.
50. In AF patients who undergo **PCI for acute coronary syndrome** and have **CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2**, **triple therapy** (oral anticoagulant + aspirin + P2Y₁₂ inhibitor) is recommended for **1–4 weeks**.
51. After a short course of triple therapy, **dual therapy** with a **DOAC plus a P2Y₁₂ inhibitor** (usually clopidogrel or ticagrelor) is preferred to reduce bleeding risk.
52. In AF with **stable CAD ≥ 1 year post-PCI**, **oral anticoagulation alone** may be sufficient for secondary prevention.
53. For AF patients receiving **two or more antithrombotic agents**, **proton-pump-inhibitor therapy** is recommended and **NSAIDs should be avoided** to minimize gastrointestinal-bleeding risk.
54. In patients with AF and **stable CAD**, **rivaroxaban monotherapy** is non-inferior to rivaroxaban + aspirin for ischemic prevention and causes **less bleeding**.
55. Standard management of AF prioritizes **effective ventricular-rate control**, targeting a resting heart rate **< 80 beats min⁻¹** in symptomatic patients and **< 110 beats min⁻¹** in asymptomatic patients without LV dysfunction.
56. A **rhythm-control strategy** offers additional benefit in AF patients who are **younger, symptomatic, within 1 year of diagnosis, or have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction**.
57. The **EAST-AFNET 4 trial** showed that initiating rhythm-control therapy **within 1 year of AF diagnosis** reduced cardiovascular death, stroke, and hospitalization versus usual care.
58. **Catheter ablation (pulmonary-vein isolation)** is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm and may be considered **first-line therapy** in selected symptomatic AF patients without significant left-atrial enlargement.
59. Regardless of sinus-rhythm maintenance after successful ablation, **long-term anticoagulation decisions** should continue to be guided by the **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score**.
60. **Periprocedural risks of AF ablation** include thromboembolism (0.5 – 1 %), cardiac tamponade, and access-site vascular injury; **pulmonary-vein stenosis** is a rare late complication.
61. In AF patients with **refractory symptomatic tachycardia**, **AV-node ablation plus permanent pacemaker implantation** can control ventricular rate, but **lifelong anticoagulation remains mandatory**.
62. Approximately **10–25 % of AF patients** have contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation; for those with **CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 3 and bleeding concerns**, **left-atrial-appendage occlusion (LAAO)** offers an alternative stroke-prevention strategy.
63. After percutaneous **LAAO**, most patients require **short-term anticoagulation** followed by **long-term antiplatelet therapy** while the device endothelializes.
64. **LAAO** carries ongoing risks of **peri-device leak** and **device-related thrombus**, and no consensus exists on routine post-procedure imaging surveillance.
65. **AF coexists with heart failure in roughly 40 % of cases**, and the combination markedly worsens morbidity and mortality.
66. Randomized trials show that **aggressive rhythm control** in patients with **AF and concomitant heart failure** improves symptoms, decreases hospitalization, and reduces mortality.
67. In **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction**, **catheter ablation of AF** yields superior outcomes compared with antiarrhythmic-drug therapy in appropriately selected patients.
68. **Subclinical (device-detected) AF** is defined as **asymptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia lasting ≥ 20 seconds but < 24 hours**, increasingly recognized with implantable rhythm devices and consumer wearables.
69. Because subclinical AF often progresses to clinically apparent arrhythmia, **guideline-directed lifestyle modification and risk-factor control** are advisable even in asymptomatic individuals.
70. Current guidelines recommend **oral anticoagulation** for **device-detected AF lasting ≥ 24 hours with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2** or for **episodes lasting 5 minutes – 24 hours with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 3**.
71. In **embolic stroke of undetermined source**, any device-detected AF episode **> 30 seconds** justifies initiation of oral anticoagulation.
72. When ambulatory monitoring fails to reveal AF after cryptogenic stroke, **implantation of an insertable loop recorder** is indicated to facilitate long-term detection of subclinical arrhythmia.
