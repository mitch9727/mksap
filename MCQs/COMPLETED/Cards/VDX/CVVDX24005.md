### 🫠 Electrocardiography: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) Criteria

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)** can be diagnosed on electrocardiogram (ECG) using the **Sokolow-Lyon criteria**, which include a sum of the deepest **S wave in lead V1** and the tallest **R wave in lead V5 or V6** measuring **35 mm or greater**.
2. An **R wave in lead aVL measuring 11 mm or greater** is another Sokolow-Lyon criterion indicative of **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**.
3. The **Cornell criteria** define **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)** as a sum of the **S wave in lead V3** and **R wave in aVL** greater than **20 mm for women** or **28 mm for men**.
4. **Secondary ST–T-wave abnormalities**, including **asymmetric ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion**, are ECG findings that support the diagnosis of **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**.
5. A **normal QRS duration** on ECG rules out the presence of a **bundle branch block**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria are commonly used due to their simplicity and association with increased left ventricular mass.
2. The R wave in aVL criterion may have lower sensitivity but is specific in older patients.
3. The Cornell criteria offer improved sensitivity over Sokolow-Lyon, especially in women.
4. These repolarization abnormalities (sometimes called "strain patterns") occur in leads reflecting the left ventricle, such as I, aVL, and V4–V6.
5. Bundle branch blocks typically present with widened QRS complexes (>120 ms), which is absent in this case.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The most common cause of **aortic stenosis** is **degenerative calcification of the aortic valve** associated with aging.
2. **Congenital bicuspid aortic valve**, **rheumatic heart disease**, and **chest irradiation** are additional causes of aortic stenosis.
3. **Severe aortic stenosis** causes **chronic left ventricular pressure overload**, leading to **concentric left ventricular hypertrophy** and **myocardial fibrosis**.
4. Common symptoms of **aortic stenosis** include **exertional dyspnea**, **syncope**, and **angina**, which typically appear only in **severe disease**.
5. Among **asymptomatic patients** with **severe aortic stenosis**, **75%** will develop symptoms or die within **5 years**.
6. Characteristic findings of **severe aortic stenosis** include a **late-peaking systolic murmur**, **diminished or absent aortic component of S2**, and **delayed carotid upstroke**.
7. The **loudness or harshness** of the murmur **does not correlate** with the severity of aortic stenosis.
8. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the primary imaging test for evaluating aortic stenosis severity, valve morphology, and left ventricular function.
9. **Severe aortic stenosis** is typically defined by a **valve area ≤1.0 cm²**, **peak velocity ≥4 m/s**, or **mean gradient ≥40 mm Hg**.
10. In **low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis** with **reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <50%)**, **dobutamine stress testing** is used to distinguish **true severe stenosis** from **pseudostenosis**.
11. In **paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis** (with preserved LVEF), low flow is due to **small left ventricular cavity size**, **high afterload**, or **atrial fibrillation**.
12. **Computed tomography (CT)** aortic valve **calcium scoring** may be useful in confirming severity in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis.
13. **Aortic valve replacement** improves **survival** in patients with **low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis**, regardless of ejection fraction.
14. The **aortic valve area** typically decreases by **approximately 0.12 cm² per year** in patients with aortic stenosis.
15. Patients with **severe aortic stenosis** should undergo **serial evaluation every 6 to 12 months**.
16. **Exercise stress testing** is **contraindicated** in patients with **symptomatic severe aortic stenosis**.
17. **Exercise stress testing** may be used in **asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis** to confirm symptom status, but only under **cardiologist supervision**.
18. In **pseudostenosis**, dobutamine increases cardiac output and valve opening, raising valve area into the **moderate range**.
19. In **true low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**, valve area remains ≤1.0 cm² and gradient increases with stroke volume during dobutamine stress testing.
20. **Echocardiography** may **underestimate the severity** of **aortic stenosis** in some patients, especially when findings are discordant with clinical presentation.
21. **Cardiac catheterization** is used to directly measure **cardiac output** and the **aortic pressure gradient** when noninvasive testing is inconclusive.
22. **Stroke volume index ≤35 mL/m²** defines **low transvalvular flow**, a key criterion for low-flow states in aortic stenosis assessment.
23. There are two forms of **low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**: one with **reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <50%)** and another with **preserved LVEF (≥50%)**, also called **paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**.
24. In **true low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**, dobutamine increases stroke volume, but **valve area remains ≤1.0 cm²**, confirming severe disease.
25. In **pseudostenosis**, dobutamine increases **valve opening** and **valve area** into the **moderate stenosis range**, suggesting non-severe disease.
26. **Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis** is associated with **small left ventricular cavity size**, **high afterload**, or **other causes of low output**, such as **atrial fibrillation** or **pulmonary hypertension**.
27. Accurate diagnosis of **paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis** requires integrated assessment of **hemodynamics**, **valve calcification**, **left ventricular hypertrophy**, and **clinical context**.
28. **Aortic valve calcium scoring by computed tomography (CT)** is a reasonable adjunct in evaluating **low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**, regardless of ejection fraction.
29. Observational studies show that **aortic valve replacement** improves **survival** in both forms of **low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**, whether **LVEF is reduced or preserved**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Degenerative calcific changes account for the majority of cases in patients ≥65 years.
2. Bicuspid valve stenosis often occurs earlier in life; rheumatic and radiation-induced causes may involve other valves.
3. Long-standing pressure overload leads to fibrosis, contributing to heart failure symptoms.
4. These symptoms are late manifestations and carry a poor prognosis once present.
5. This high event rate supports surveillance even in asymptomatic severe cases.
6. These findings reflect hemodynamic compromise and low cardiac output.
7. Murmur intensity can be misleading; valve area and gradients are more accurate measures.
8. TTE also evaluates for right-sided involvement and pulmonary hypertension.
9. These thresholds define hemodynamic severity and guide management decisions.
10. Pseudostenosis resolves with increased cardiac output; true stenosis does not.
11. These patients have preserved systolic function but still present with low transvalvular flow.
12. Calcium score helps confirm diagnosis when flow and gradient are incongruent with valve area.
13. Observational data support early valve replacement in these populations.
14. Rate of progression can vary with age, comorbidities, and baseline valve severity.
15. Serial imaging detects progression and helps time referral for intervention.
16. Risk of sudden decompensation makes stress testing unsafe in symptomatic cases.
17. Cardiologist supervision ensures safety and correct interpretation of findings.
18. Dobutamine reveals improved opening only in pseudostenosis due to increased driving pressure.
19. This pattern confirms truly severe obstruction despite low resting output.
20. Clinical suspicion should prompt further testing when echocardiographic measurements are incongruent.
21. Invasive hemodynamics may be necessary in symptomatic patients being considered for valve intervention.
22. This stroke volume index threshold is used in both reduced and preserved ejection fraction states.
23. Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis occurs despite preserved systolic function due to mechanical impedance or structural factors.
24. Persistence of a small valve area with increased flow confirms fixed stenosis.
25. A rise in valve area with increased flow indicates the initial low area was functional and not truly severe.
26. These patients often exhibit concentric remodeling or comorbidities that impair stroke volume.
27. Imaging, flow dynamics, and symptoms must all be integrated to avoid underdiagnosing severity.
28. CT calcium score adds value when echocardiographic severity criteria are ambiguous.
29. Surgical or transcatheter intervention is associated with better outcomes than conservative therapy in this subgroup.
