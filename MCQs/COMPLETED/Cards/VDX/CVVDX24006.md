### 🫀 Arrhythmias: Atrial Flutter

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial flutter** is characterized on **electrocardiogram (ECG)** by a **sawtooth pattern** and a **regular atrial rate** often close to **300 beats per minute**.
2. **Flutter waves** are most easily seen in the **inferior leads** (leads **II, III, and aVF**).
3. The most common conduction pattern in **atrial flutter** is **2:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction**, resulting in a **ventricular rate** of approximately **150 beats per minute**.
4. **Atrial flutter** can also exhibit other conduction patterns, such as **4:1 AV conduction** with a **ventricular rate** of approximately **75 beats per minute**, leading to an **irregular rhythm**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The tracing in the case showed both 2:1 and 4:1 AV conduction, causing variability in the ventricular rate and rhythm.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial flutter** is an **organized macro-reentrant tachycardia** with **discrete regular atrial activity** on ECG, typically with an **atrial rate of 250 to 300 beats per minute**.
2. **Typical atrial flutter** results from **counterclockwise reentry around the tricuspid annulus** and is the dominant form in patients **without prior cardiac disease**.
3. **Typical atrial flutter** shows **inverted flutter waves** in **leads II, III, and aVF** and **positive flutter waves** in **lead V1**.
4. **Atypical atrial flutter** is most commonly seen in patients with **prior atrial fibrillation ablation** or **cardiac surgery** and involves reentry circuits in other parts of the **right or left atria**.
5. **Anticoagulation management** for **chronic atrial flutter** is similar to that for **atrial fibrillation**.
6. **Rhythm control** is generally favored over **rate control** in atrial flutter due to the difficulty of achieving adequate rate control, which often requires **high doses of multiple AV nodal blockers**.
7. **Catheter ablation** is the **definitive treatment** for **typical atrial flutter**, with a **success rate >95%** and **low complication rate**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atrial flutter produces characteristic atrial waveforms distinct from atrial fibrillation, allowing for clearer ECG diagnosis.
2. The tricuspid annulus provides an anatomic substrate for the reentrant circuit in typical flutter.
3. This ECG pattern is a key diagnostic feature for distinguishing typical flutter.
4. Atypical flutter includes post-surgical and post-ablation variants with different reentrant paths.
5. Stroke risk in atrial flutter is managed similarly to atrial fibrillation using CHA₂DS₂-VASc scoring.
6. Rate control failure often necessitates rhythm control strategies in flutter, unlike atrial fibrillation.
7. Ablation offers a curative option for symptomatic or refractory typical flutter.

    <strong>ECG Demonstrating Typical Atrial Flutter</strong><br>
    In this ECG demonstrating typical atrial flutter, negatively directed sawtooth waves are seen in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF), and positive waves are seen in lead V1. In the bottom rhythm strip, 2:1 and 4:1 conduction patterns are most easily seen.
