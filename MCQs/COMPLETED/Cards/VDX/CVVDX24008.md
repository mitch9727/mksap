### 🫠 Congenital Heart Disease: Ostium Secundum Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) and ECG Findings

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD)** is the **most common type of ASD**, accounting for approximately **75% of cases**, and is located in the **mid portion of the atrial septum**.
2. **Symptoms** of ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) may include **fatigue**, **exertional dyspnea**, **arrhythmias**, and **paradoxical embolism**.
3. Clinical examination findings in patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) may include a **parasternal impulse**, **fixed splitting of the second heart sound (S2)**, and a **pulmonary outflow murmur**.
4. A **diastolic flow rumble across the tricuspid valve** may occur in patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) when there is a **large left-to-right shunt**.
5. Typical **electrocardiogram (ECG)** findings in ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) include **right axis deviation** (e.g., **negative QRS in lead I** and **positive QRS in leads II, III, and aVF**) and **incomplete right bundle branch block** (e.g., **QRS duration <120 ms**, **prominent S wave in lateral leads**, and **prominent qR complex in lead V1**).

#### 💬 Extra
1. Ostium secundum ASDs are typically **isolated congenital anomalies**, unlike primum or sinus venosus defects that are often associated with other anomalies.
4. A left-to-right shunt increases right-sided blood flow, leading to augmented **diastolic flow across the tricuspid valve**.
5. Right axis deviation and incomplete right bundle branch block are consequences of **right ventricular volume overload** due to the ASD.

7. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the **preferred imaging modality** to identify ostium secundum and ostium primum atrial septal defects (ASDs).
8. **TTE with agitated saline contrast injection** may help detect an **atrial-level shunt** in atrial septal defect (ASD).
9. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** imaging and **computed tomography (CT)** are useful for identifying **anomalous pulmonary venous connections** and for quantifying **right ventricular volume** and **ejection fraction** in atrial septal defect (ASD).

11. In **ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD)**, **electrocardiogram (ECG)** typically shows **left axis deviation** and **first-degree atrioventricular block**.
12. **Sinus venosus atrial septal defect (ASD)** is associated with an **abnormal P‑wave axis** on **ECG**.
13. **Ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD)** may result in **mitral regurgitation** due to a **mitral valve cleft**.
14. **Sinus venosus atrial septal defect (ASD)** may be associated with a **residual anomalous pulmonary venous connection** following repair.
15. **Patent foramen ovale (PFO)** is typically **normal** on ECG and chest radiography but may lead to **paradoxical embolism** or **platypnea‑orthodeoxia syndrome**.
16. **Repaired tetralogy of Fallot** is associated with **right bundle branch block (RBBB)** and **prolonged QRS duration**, which correlates with the degree of **right ventricular dilatation**.
17. In **repaired tetralogy of Fallot**, a **QRS duration >180 ms** increases the risk for **ventricular tachycardia** and **sudden death**.
18. **Large ventricular septal defect (VSD)** may lead to **Eisenmenger syndrome**, especially in the presence of **pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)**.
19. **Large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)** may result in **right‑sided heart failure**, **endocarditis**, or **Eisenmenger syndrome**.
20. **Pulmonary valve stenosis** may lead to **severe pulmonary valve regurgitation** after **valvotomy** or **valvuloplasty**.
21. **Coarctation of the aorta** often presents with **left ventricular hypertrophy** and **ST‑T wave changes** on ECG and a **“figure 3” sign** with **rib notching** on chest radiograph.
22. More than **50 % of patients with aortic coarctation** have a **bicuspid aortic valve**, and approximately **75 % develop systemic hypertension**.
23. **Repaired tetralogy of Fallot** may show **cardiomegaly**, **pulmonary or tricuspid valve regurgitation**, and a **right aortic arch** on chest radiograph in about **25 %** of cases.
24. **Eisenmenger syndrome** is characterized by **right axis deviation**, **right atrial enlargement**, and **right ventricular hypertrophy** on ECG, and **reduced pulmonary vascularity** on chest radiography.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Enlargement of the right atrium or right ventricle on imaging without another cause should prompt evaluation for an atrial-level shunt.
6. These auscultatory findings are due to **increased pulmonary blood flow** and **delayed right ventricular systole**.
7. TTE also provides assessment of **right-sided chamber size**, **tricuspid regurgitation**, and **right ventricular systolic pressure**.
10. Qp:Qs quantification is especially relevant when deciding on **ASD closure** in patients with **pulmonary hypertension** or when **noninvasive testing is inconclusive**.
11. The left axis deviation in ostium primum ASD reflects conduction delay near the atrioventricular node.
13. A cleft mitral valve in primum ASDs can worsen left‑sided volume overload and contribute to mitral regurgitation.
14. Sinus venosus ASDs frequently involve anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may persist after surgical repair.
16. The RBBB pattern in repaired tetralogy of Fallot results from surgical scarring of the right ventricular outflow tract.
17. Serial monitoring of QRS duration is important in long‑term surveillance after tetralogy repair.
18. Eisenmenger physiology reflects reversal of shunt direction secondary to progressive pulmonary hypertension.
21. Rib notching in aortic coarctation is due to collateral flow through enlarged intercostal arteries.
22. A bicuspid aortic valve is commonly associated with other left‑sided obstructive lesions such as coarctation.

The **carotid pulse is normal**. Wide S2 splitting is due to **increased right ventricular stroke volume** and/or **increased pulmonary vascular compliance**, resulting in **inertial delay of the pulmonic component (P2)**.<br>
