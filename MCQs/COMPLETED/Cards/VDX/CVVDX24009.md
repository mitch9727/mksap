### 🫠 Electrocardiography: Ischemia on Exercise Stress Testing

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Myocardial ischemia during exercise electrocardiogram (ECG)** is defined by the development of **ST-segment elevation** or **horizontal/downsloping ST-segment depression of ≥1 mm**, occurring **80 milliseconds after the J point**.
2. **ST-segment depression on exercise ECG** cannot localize ischemia but confirms the presence of **myocardial ischemia**.
3. **ST-segment elevation in lead aVR** during exercise ECG is a **high-risk finding**, raising suspicion for **critical left main coronary artery disease**.
4. A **normal resting ECG** does not exclude **coronary artery disease (CAD)**, as abnormalities may be unmasked during **exercise stress testing**.
5. The presence of **horizontal ST-segment depression** in **leads II, III, aVF, V4, and V5** during exercise is consistent with **exercise-induced myocardial ischemia**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ST-segment changes during stress testing must be measured **80 ms after the J point** to reliably identify ischemia.
2. Although ST depressions confirm ischemia, **they do not localize the affected coronary territory**, unlike ST elevations in acute coronary syndromes.
3. ST elevation in aVR during stress suggests **extensive or left main coronary artery disease**, often requiring **urgent angiography**.
4. Exercise ECG is a **noninvasive, first-line test** for evaluating suspected **obstructive CAD** in symptomatic ambulatory patients.

    Electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest and during exercise. The **resting ECG** is normal, while the **exercise ECG** reveals **ST-segment elevation in lead aVR** and **horizontal ST-segment depressions** in leads **II, III, aVF, V4, and V5**, consistent with **exercise-induced myocardial ischemia** and raising concern for **critical left main coronary artery disease**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Exercise electrocardiogram (ECG)** is a reasonable diagnostic test in patients with **normal baseline ECG findings** and **no disabling comorbid conditions** such as **frailty**, **marked obesity (BMI >40)**, **peripheral artery disease**, **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, or **orthopedic limitations**.
2. In patients with **baseline ECG abnormalities** (e.g., **ST-segment depression >1 mm**, **left bundle branch block**, **left ventricular hypertrophy**, **paced rhythm**, or **preexcitation**), **exercise-induced ST changes** are **not specific** for **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
3. In such patients with abnormal baseline ECGs, **stress testing with adjunctive imaging** or **coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA)** is preferred.
4. **Exercise stress testing protocols**, such as the **Bruce protocol**, increase workload in a **stepwise manner** using **treadmill or bicycle ergometry** to allow time for maximal metabolic demand to develop.
5. An **adequate exercise stress test** is defined as achieving **85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate** or a **rate pressure product** (heart rate × systolic blood pressure) of **≥25,000**.
6. **Indications to terminate exercise stress testing** include **angina**, **light-headedness**, **exertional hypotension**, **hypertension >200/110 mm Hg**, **significant ST-segment elevation or depression**, or **arrhythmias**.
7. **Myocardial ischemia** on exercise ECG is identified by **horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression ≥1 mm**, occurring **80 milliseconds after the J point**.
8. **ST-segment depression** during exercise ECG does **not localize** the ischemic territory or the **culprit coronary artery**.
9. **Exercise-induced hypotension** or **lack of blood pressure augmentation** may indicate **significant obstructive CAD**.
10. **Exercise capacity** is a strong predictor of **prognosis** in CAD; inability to achieve **5 metabolic equivalents of task (METs)** or **complete Stage 1 of Bruce protocol** is associated with **higher mortality**.
11. **Heart rate recovery** after exercise is prognostically significant; a **heart rate drop <12/min** in the first minute after exercise is associated with **increased mortality**.
12. The **Duke Treadmill Score** combines **exercise duration**, **symptoms**, and **ST-segment depression** to estimate **5-year all-cause mortality** in patients without known CAD.
13. **Standard treadmill ECG testing** is preferred in patients with a **normal resting ECG** who are able to **exercise** due to its **low cost**, **simplicity**, and **widespread availability**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Exercise ECG is not recommended in patients with baseline conduction or repolarization abnormalities due to **low specificity** for ischemia.
2. A **Bruce protocol** consists of treadmill speed and incline increases every 3 minutes.
5. The rate pressure product reflects myocardial oxygen demand and workload adequacy.
6. These termination criteria prevent complications and allow safe test interpretation.
7. The 80-ms post-J point window reduces false positives by standardizing ST measurements.
9. A failure to raise blood pressure appropriately may indicate severe **left main or multivessel disease**.
11. Impaired autonomic function contributes to delayed heart rate recovery.
12. The Duke score is widely used to stratify intermediate-risk patients after testing.
13. This makes it an excellent first-line test in **low-to-intermediate-risk symptomatic patients**.
