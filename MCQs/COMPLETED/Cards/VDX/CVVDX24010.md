### 🫠 Cardiology: Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Right bundle branch block (RBBB)** is diagnosed on electrocardiogram (ECG) by **QRS widening (≥120 ms)**, an **rSR′ or rsR′ pattern in lead V1**, and **wide terminal S waves in leads I and V6**.
2. In both **left and right bundle branch block**, the **ST-segment and T-wave direction is opposite the main QRS vector**, and these abnormalities are **secondary to the conduction delay**, not indicative of additional pathology.
3. The presence of **discrete P waves throughout an ECG** excludes the diagnosis of **atrial fibrillation**.
4. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** may be seen on ECG but do not change the diagnosis if criteria for bundle branch block are met.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This ECG demonstrates typical findings of RBBB.
2. The repolarization abnormalities seen in bundle branch block do not indicate ischemia or other primary causes.
3. Atrial fibrillation would show absent P waves with irregularly irregular rhythm.
4. PACs represent ectopic atrial activity and are commonly seen in structurally normal and abnormal hearts.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **hemodynamically significant bradycardia** should receive **atropine**.
2. **Chronotropic drug infusions**, such as **dopamine** or **epinephrine**, may be used until **temporary pacing** is implemented.
3. **Temporary transvenous pacing** is indicated for **transient causes** of **hemodynamically unstable bradycardia** or **asystole**.
4. In **hemodynamically stable patients**, **reversible and extrinsic causes** of bradycardia should be corrected before considering **permanent pacing**.
5. **Common indications for permanent pacing** include **symptomatic bradycardia without reversible cause**, **permanent atrial fibrillation with bradycardia**, **alternating bundle branch block**, **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block**, **high-degree AV block**, and **complete AV block**, regardless of symptoms.
6. Patients with stable **left bundle branch block** or **right bundle branch block**, with or without a prolonged PR interval, do not require permanent pacing due to their low progression risk (1%-3% per year).
7. **Leadless pacemakers** are used for **single-chamber ventricular pacing** in selected patients with **permanent atrial fibrillation** or **high-grade AV block** with **intact sinus node function**.
8. **Conduction system pacing** places leads in or near the **His-Purkinje system** to mimic native conduction and may yield near-normal ECG patterns.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atropine is the first-line treatment for bradycardia causing hypotension or poor perfusion.
2. Chronotropic agents serve as bridges to pacing when bradycardia is unstable and not immediately correctable.
3. Temporary pacing is typically used when a reversible insult is suspected or pacing is only needed short term.
4. Examples of reversible causes include drug effects, hypoxia, metabolic disturbances, and ischemia.
5. These conduction abnormalities are considered inherently unstable or indicative of progressive disease.
6. Bundle branch blocks alone do not usually warrant pacing unless they meet higher-risk criteria.
7. Leadless devices avoid the risks of leads and pockets but have limited pacing capabilities.
8. This technique may improve cardiac output in patients requiring ventricular pacing and avoids pacing-induced dyssynchrony.
