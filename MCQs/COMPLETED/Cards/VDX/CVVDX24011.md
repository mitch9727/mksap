### 🫀 Aortic Disease: Type A Aortic Dissection Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Computed tomography (CT) angiography** of the chest that shows an intimal dissection plane extending through the aortic arch is diagnostic of **type A aortic dissection**.
2. **Type A aortic dissection** typically presents with sudden‑onset severe chest or back pain described as tearing or ripping, but this characteristic pain may be absent.
3. Presenting features of **type A aortic dissection** may include systemic hypertension, syncope, a diastolic murmur of acute **aortic regurgitation**, or acute heart failure caused by sudden aortic insufficiency.
4. Physical‑examination clues that should raise suspicion for **acute aortic dissection** include markedly asymmetric blood pressures between the upper extremities, pulse asymmetry, and **pulsus paradoxus**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The red arrow on the axial CT image points to the intimal flap within the ascending aorta noted in Statement&nbsp;1.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute aortic syndromes** are life‑threatening conditions that require rapid diagnosis and treatment to prevent catastrophic complications.
2. **Chest radiography** may reveal a widened mediastinum and the **electrocardiogram (ECG)** may show ST‑segment depression in acute aortic dissection, but neither finding is diagnostic.
3. When the clinical likelihood of **acute aortic dissection** is high, **diagnostic imaging should be performed immediately**.
4. **Computed tomography (CT) angiography**, **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**, and **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** have comparable sensitivity and specificity for detecting acute thoracic aortic disease, but CT angiography is preferred because it is rapid, widely available, and aids procedural planning.
5. Compared with CT angiography and MRA, **transesophageal echocardiography** offers advantages in suspected aortic dissection by being portable for unstable patients, avoiding iodinated contrast, and providing detailed assessment of aortic valve structure and function.
6. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is often used initially but has limited ability to visualize the distal ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, and descending aorta.
7. **Invasive aortography** is rarely required for diagnosing acute aortic disease, except during endovascular repair or when non‑invasive imaging is contraindicated or unavailable.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ST‑segment depression on ECG reflects myocardial ischemia that can accompany dissection but lacks specificity for diagnosis.
