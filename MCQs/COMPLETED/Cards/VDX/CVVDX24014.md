### 🫀 Congenital Heart Disease: Radiographic Signs of Aortic Coarctation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic coarctation** may present on chest radiograph with a **“figure 3 sign”**, representing an indentation at the coarctation site flanked by **dilatation of the aorta** above and below the narrowing.
2. **Rib notching** on chest radiograph can be seen in aortic coarctation and is caused by **erosion from forceful pulsations** of **dilated intercostal arteries** involved in collateral blood flow.
3. The **“figure 3 sign”** and **rib notching** are classic radiographic findings suggestive of **aortic coarctation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The “figure 3 sign” is formed by focal aortic indentation (site of coarctation) between prestenotic and poststenotic dilatation, visualized on frontal chest radiograph.
2. The intercostal arteries become dilated due to collateral circulation from obstructed aortic flow, resulting in chronic pulsatile pressure and bone remodeling.
3. Recognition of these findings enables early diagnosis of congenital aortic obstruction.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Aortic coarctation** should be suspected in patients with **severe hypertension**, especially if they are **young** or their **hypertension is refractory to pharmacologic therapy**.
2. **Severe aortic coarctation** may present as **heart failure** or, rarely, **claudication**.
3. **Radial-to-femoral artery pulse delay**, with **upper extremity hypertension** and **reduced lower extremity pulses and blood pressure**, is a physical exam clue to **aortic coarctation**.
4. **Systolic or continuous murmurs** heard over the **left infraclavicular region**, **back**, or **chest wall** may suggest **aortic coarctation**, especially if arising from **collateral intercostal vessels**.
5. **Bicuspid aortic valve** is present in approximately **50% of patients** with aortic coarctation.
6. **Auscultation findings** in bicuspid aortic valve may include an **ejection click**, **systolic murmur at the base**, or **S4**.
7. **Turner syndrome** is commonly associated with **aortic coarctation** and **bicuspid aortic valve**.
8. **Turner syndrome** is characterized by **short stature**, **webbed neck**, **broad chest**, **widely spaced nipples**, and **infertility**.
9. Aortic coarctation is also associated with **other left-sided heart defects**, **ventricular septal defect (VSD)**, and **cerebral aneurysms**.
10. The **“figure 3 sign”** on chest radiograph is caused by **aortic dilatation above and below the coarctation**.
11. **Dilated intercostal arteries** can cause **rib notching** on radiograph due to collateral flow.
12. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is usually the initial diagnostic test to evaluate **aortic coarctation**, **bicuspid aortic valve**, and **left ventricular hypertrophy**.
13. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** and **computed tomography (CT)** are used to evaluate the **anatomy, severity, and location** of coarctation and assess for **collaterals or aneurysms**.
14. **Cardiac catheterization** is primarily used in patients being considered for **percutaneous intervention**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Young patients with difficult-to-control hypertension are a key population in whom coarctation should be considered.
2. Claudication in this context is due to diminished blood flow to the lower extremities.
3. This pulse delay reflects obstructed flow distal to the aortic arch.
4. Collateral flow through dilated intercostal arteries can create audible murmurs over atypical locations.
5. Bicuspid valve abnormalities commonly co-occur due to developmental timing of left-sided heart structures.
6. These auscultatory findings reflect turbulent flow and decreased compliance of the abnormal valve.
7. Turner syndrome is a well-known genetic risk factor for congenital left-sided heart lesions.
8. These phenotypic features help in clinical recognition of Turner syndrome.
9. The developmental spectrum of aortic coarctation includes various congenital anomalies.
10. This appearance is due to changes in aortic contour from pressure buildup above and poststenotic dilation below the narrowed segment.
11. The pulsatile force of blood through these collateral pathways leads to bone erosion over time.
12. TTE provides hemodynamic data and structural evaluation, especially in younger or initial presentations.
13. Cross-sectional imaging is critical for procedural planning or further characterization of anatomy.
14. Invasive assessment is generally reserved for therapeutic planning.
