### 🫠 Cardiac Electrophysiology: Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)** accounts for approximately **two-thirds of all supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs)**.
2. Patients with **AVNRT** have **dual atrioventricular (AV) node physiology**, consisting of a **fast pathway** (rapid conduction, long refractory period) and a **slow pathway** (slow conduction, short refractory period).
3. In **typical AVNRT (slow-fast subtype)**, a premature beat may conduct down the **slow pathway** and retrograde up the **fast pathway**, creating a **reentrant circuit** and **sustained tachycardia**.
4. The **ventricular rate** in AVNRT typically ranges from **120 beats per minute to 220 beats per minute**.
5. In AVNRT, **P waves are often buried within the QRS complex**, or partially distort the QRS, sometimes creating a **pseudo-RSR′ pattern in lead V1**.
6. In **atrial tachycardia** and **sinus tachycardia**, **P waves precede the QRS complex** and are typically visible.
7. **Antidromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia** typically shows a **wide QRS complex** due to conduction over an **accessory bypass tract**.
8. AVNRT is typically characterized by a **short RP interval** with a **retrograde P wave** close to the QRS complex.
9. **Vagal maneuvers** or **adenosine** may terminate episodes of AVNRT.
10. **AV nodal blockers**, including **β-blockers** and **calcium channel blockers**, are used to **prevent recurrent AVNRT**.
11. **Catheter ablation** is a first-line treatment option for AVNRT in patients who do not tolerate or prefer to avoid long-term medical therapy.
12. **Catheter ablation** for AVNRT has a **high success rate** and a **<1% risk of AV node injury** requiring **pacemaker implantation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. AVNRT is the most common form of paroxysmal SVT seen in structurally normal hearts.
3. The dual pathway conduction allows a self-sustaining loop to develop, triggering continuous AV nodal activation.
5. The fusion of the P wave with the QRS complex accounts for the difficult-to-discern atrial activity in AVNRT.
7. This wide-complex tachycardia helps differentiate AVRT from AVNRT on ECG.
9. Vagal maneuvers increase vagal tone, briefly slowing AV nodal conduction and disrupting the reentrant circuit.
11. Catheter ablation targets the slow pathway, reducing the likelihood of reentry.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)** accounts for **two-thirds of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) cases**, excluding atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
2. **AVNRT** is caused by a **reentrant circuit** within the **AV node**, using both **fast and slow pathways**.
3. The classic ECG finding in AVNRT includes a **short RP interval** and a **retrograde P wave** that is **very close to the QRS complex**.
4. **Vagal maneuvers** and **adenosine** can terminate AVNRT by **interrupting AV nodal conduction**.
5. **β-Blockers** and **calcium channel blockers** are used as **preventive therapy** for recurrent AVNRT.
6. **Catheter ablation** is a **first-line treatment** in patients with AVNRT who prefer to avoid or cannot tolerate long-term medications.
7. **Catheter ablation** of AVNRT has a **high success rate** with a **<1% risk of AV node injury** that may require **pacemaker implantation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are categorized separately due to different pathophysiologic mechanisms.
2. The fast pathway conducts rapidly but recovers slowly, while the slow pathway is slower but recovers quickly.
3. The P wave may appear immediately after the QRS or be embedded within it.
6. Shared decision-making is important when offering catheter ablation as an alternative to medications.
