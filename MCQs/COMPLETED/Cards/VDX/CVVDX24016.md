### 🫠 Arrhythmias: Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Accelerated idioventricular rhythm** is a **ventricular escape rhythm** with a heart rate **between 50/min and 100/min**.
2. **Idioventricular rhythms** originate from the **ventricular myocardium** and produce **wide QRS complexes** that are typically **regular** in rhythm.
3. **Accelerated idioventricular rhythm** is commonly observed **after reperfusion** and is generally **benign and transient**.
4. The **QRS morphology** in accelerated idioventricular rhythm is **not consistent with left bundle branch block**, which typically shows an **upright monophasic QRS in leads I and V6**.
5. **Accelerated idioventricular rhythm** can be differentiated from **ventricular tachycardia** by its **slower rate**.
6. **Torsades de pointes** is a form of **polymorphic ventricular tachycardia** marked by **varying QRS morphology**, which is **not present** in accelerated idioventricular rhythm.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This heart rhythm is faster than typical idioventricular rhythms (30–40/min) but slower than ventricular tachycardia.
3. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm is especially noted in the setting of **post-thrombolytic or post-PCI reperfusion** in myocardial infarction.
4. The absence of classic left bundle branch block findings helps rule out other causes of wide QRS complexes.
5. Ventricular tachycardia generally occurs at rates exceeding **100/min**, making rate a key distinguishing feature.
6. The ECG in question shows regular wide QRS complexes without the characteristic twisting morphology of torsades de pointes.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrial fibrillation** complicates up to **20% of ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs)** and may lead to **hemodynamic instability**.
2. **Ventricular tachycardia** or **ventricular fibrillation** can occur **during myocardial infarction (MI)** or **after reperfusion**.
3. **Postinfarction ventricular arrhythmias** that are **repetitive or sustained** beyond **48 hours** may require **prolonged telemetry** and consideration of **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy** before discharge.
4. Routine **suppression of ventricular ectopy** with **antiarrhythmic drugs** is **not recommended** and may worsen outcomes.
5. **Accelerated idioventricular rhythm** is a **common reperfusion arrhythmia** that is **benign and transient**, requiring **no treatment**.
6. **Vagally mediated atrioventricular (AV) block**, including **Wenckebach** and **complete heart block**, may occur **after inferior MI** and may require **temporary pacing**.
7. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block**, more common with **anterior MI**, may progress to **complete heart block** and requires **permanent pacing**.
8. **Cardiogenic shock** following MI is most often caused by a **large anterior infarction** with **severely reduced left ventricular systolic function**.
9. **Cardiogenic shock** is suggested by **hypotension**, **sinus tachycardia**, **oliguria**, **cool extremities**, and **altered mentation**.
10. **Early reperfusion** improves survival in **cardiogenic shock**, particularly in patients **younger than 75 years**.
11. **Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** is **not recommended** during shock due to risks of **renal injury** and **adverse events**.
12. Temporary support options in cardiogenic shock include **intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)**, **percutaneous LV assist devices**, and **extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)**.
13. **Left ventricular (LV) apical thrombus** occurs in **10%–20% of anterior STEMIs** and is treated with **3 months of anticoagulation**.
14. **RV infarction** causes **shock**, **hypotension**, and **clear lungs**, and is treated with **volume resuscitation** and sometimes **inotropes**.
15. **Nitrates are contraindicated** in **RV infarction** because they can cause **dangerous hypotension**.
16. **LV free wall rupture** causes **sudden chest pain or syncope** and is usually fatal without **urgent surgical repair**.
17. **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)** may complicate **anterior or inferior MI** and presents with **shock and a loud holosystolic murmur**.
18. **Surgical closure** is preferred for **postinfarction VSD**, though **mortality remains high** despite intervention.
19. **Papillary muscle rupture** causes **acute severe mitral regurgitation** and requires **urgent surgical repair**.
20. **Functional ischemic mitral regurgitation** is due to **posterior leaflet tethering** and is treated with **revascularization and medical therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atrial fibrillation increases risk of embolization and worsens prognosis after MI.
3. ICD consideration is based on persistence beyond 48 hours and risk of sudden death.
5. No antiarrhythmic suppression is needed for AIVR; it typically self-terminates.
6. Temporary pacing is often needed during the acute phase of inferior MI with AV block.
7. Mobitz type 2 blocks reflect structural damage and are not reversible, unlike vagal block.
10. Delayed revascularization in cardiogenic shock is associated with higher mortality.
11. Non-culprit lesion PCI during shock can worsen renal perfusion and trigger complications.
13. Echocardiography is used to confirm thrombus before discharge.
14. Diagnosis of RV infarction is aided by ST-elevation in V4R and echocardiography.
17. VSDs post-MI result in left-to-right shunting and acute decompensation.
18. Surgical repair is difficult due to necrotic margins and fragile myocardium.
19. Posteromedial papillary muscle rupture is especially lethal due to single-vessel supply.
