### 🫀 Cardiology: Diagnosing Acute Aortic Dissection

#### ✅ True Statements
1. On chest radiography, a **widened superior mediastinum** and a **right pleural effusion** may be present in **acute aortic dissection**, but these findings are **not diagnostic**.
2. **Acute aortic dissection** can be definitively diagnosed with **transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)**, **computed tomography angiography (CTA)**, or **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**, each having **similar sensitivity and specificity** for acute thoracic aortic disease.
3. **Computed tomography angiography** is the **primary diagnostic test** for suspected **acute thoracic aortic disease** because of its **wide availability** and **rapid image acquisition time**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Mediastinal widening and pleural effusion on chest radiograph should prompt urgent cross‑sectional or echocardiographic imaging to confirm or exclude dissection.
2. Selection among TEE, CTA, and MRA depends on patient stability, contrast allergy, renal function, and resource availability.
3. CTA also provides detailed anatomic information that guides surgical or endovascular repair planning.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute aortic dissection** classically presents with **severe, sudden‑onset chest or back pain** described as **tearing or ripping**.
2. **Asymmetric upper‑extremity blood pressures**, **asymmetric pulses**, or **pulsus paradoxus** in a patient with chest pain should raise suspicion for **acute aortic dissection**.
3. A **widened mediastinum** on chest radiograph and **ST‑segment depression** on ECG may occur in **acute aortic dissection**, but these findings are **not diagnostic**.
4. In patients with a **high likelihood** of **acute aortic dissection**, **diagnostic imaging should be performed immediately**.
5. **CTA, MRA, and TEE** have **similar sensitivity and specificity** for diagnosing **acute thoracic aortic disease**, but **CTA** is preferred because it can be performed **rapidly**, is **widely available**, and **assists procedural planning**.
6. Advantages of **transesophageal echocardiography** include **portability for unstable patients**, absence of **iodinated contrast**, and the ability to provide **detailed assessment of aortic valve anatomy and function**.
7. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is limited in visualizing the **distal ascending aorta**, **transverse aortic arch**, and **descending aorta**.
8. **Invasive aortography** is **rarely indicated** for diagnosing **acute aortic disease** and is reserved for situations when **noninvasive imaging is contraindicated or unavailable** or performed **at the time of endovascular repair**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The tearing quality reflects shearing of the aortic intima and media.
2. Pulse or blood‑pressure discrepancies result from differential perfusion of branch vessels.
3. Radiographic and ECG changes lack both sensitivity and specificity; their absence does not exclude dissection.
4. Rapid diagnosis is critical because mortality increases 1–2% per hour after symptom onset without treatment.
5. CTA images the entire aorta and branch vessels, facilitating operative planning.
6. TEE can be performed at the bedside in unstable or intubated patients.
7. Acoustic windows and patient body habitus limit TTE visualization of the thoracic aorta.
8. Aortography involves radiation, iodinated contrast, and arterial access, making it less desirable when high‑quality noninvasive imaging is available.
