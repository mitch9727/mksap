### 🫠 Heart Failure: Radiographic Diagnosis of Pulmonary Edema

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiomegaly** and **bilateral perihilar alveolar infiltrates** on chest radiograph are consistent with a diagnosis of **pulmonary edema due to heart failure**.
2. **Fluid in the minor fissure** on chest radiograph is consistent with **heart failure**.
3. **Cardiomegaly** may be present in **cardiac tamponade**, but **diffuse alveolar infiltrates** are not a feature of tamponade.
4. **Eosinophilic pneumonia** typically causes **peripheral pulmonary infiltrates**, often referred to as the **"photographic negative" of pulmonary edema**.
5. **Lung cancer** more commonly presents as **discrete masses** on imaging rather than diffuse infiltrates.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This reflects classic findings of cardiogenic pulmonary edema in elderly patients with decompensated heart failure.
2. Minor fissure fluid represents interstitial edema from elevated left-sided pressures.
3. While tamponade may enlarge the cardiac silhouette, the lungs are typically clear unless other processes coexist.
4. The photographic negative refers to the imaging pattern where peripheral infiltrates spare the central regions.
5. Diffuse infiltrates would be unusual for lung cancer, which usually presents with nodules or masses.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial diagnostic testing for heart failure includes **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **chest radiography**, and **laboratory studies**.
2. **Chest radiography** may reveal **cardiomegaly**, **vascular congestion**, **engorged lymphatics (Kerley B lines)**, and **pleural effusion** in heart failure.
3. **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** levels are typically **>400 pg/mL (400 ng/L)** in patients with **heart failure**.
4. BNP levels are usually **<100 pg/mL (100 ng/L)** in patients with **pulmonary disease**.
5. BNP levels are **lower in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** than in **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
6. An elevated BNP level has a **sensitivity of 95% to 97%** and a **negative predictive value of 90% to 97%** for **heart failure**.
7. BNP levels are affected by **kidney disease**, **older age**, **sepsis**, **angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy**, and **female sex**.
8. BNP levels are **reduced** in patients with an **elevated body mass index (BMI)**.
9. For **N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)**, a level **<300 pg/mL** makes **heart failure very unlikely**.
10. NT-proBNP levels **>450 pg/mL in patients <50 years**, **>900 pg/mL in patients aged 50–75**, and **>1800 pg/mL in patients >75 years** suggest **heart failure**.
11. Laboratory assessment for heart failure should include **complete blood count**, **serum electrolytes**, **kidney function**, **glucose**, **lipid levels**, **liver function tests**, **iron studies**, and **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**.
12. **Iron studies** (serum ferritin and total iron-binding capacity) are used to assess for **hemochromatosis**.
13. **TSH** is measured to evaluate for **occult hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism** as a **reversible cause** of heart failure.
14. **Echocardiography** is the **primary diagnostic modality** for evaluating **heart failure**.
15. Echocardiography provides information on **chamber size and thickness**, **systolic and diastolic function**, and **valvular pathology**.
16. **Regional wall motion abnormalities** on echocardiography raise suspicion for **coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
17. **Myocardial hypertrophy** on echocardiography may suggest **hypertension** or **cardiac amyloidosis**.
18. **Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)** is used to evaluate for **myocarditis**, **hemochromatosis**, **sarcoidosis**, **amyloidosis**, and **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**.
19. Routine use of CMR is **not recommended** unless **echocardiographic images are poor** or a **specific diagnosis** is being evaluated.
20. Diagnosis of **HFrEF**, **heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF)**, and **HFpEF** requires **ejection fraction measurement** and evidence of **elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures**.
21. **Elevated LV filling pressures** may be demonstrated by **central venous pressure**, **BNP or NT-proBNP**, **echocardiographic criteria**, or **invasive hemodynamic assessment**.
