### 🦿 Vascular Disease: Peripheral Artery Disease Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Peripheral artery disease (PAD)** can be diagnosed using the **Buerger test**, which evaluates foot color changes with elevation and dependency.
2. A **positive Buerger test**—defined by **elevation pallor and dependent rubor**—has a **likelihood ratio of 2.8** for peripheral artery disease in a symptomatic extremity.
3. **Dependent rubor** and **pallor on elevation** of the foot are clinical signs consistent with peripheral artery disease.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The Buerger test is a bedside maneuver assessing arterial perfusion by observing changes in skin color with limb position.
2. A likelihood ratio of 2.8 moderately increases the probability of disease and supports further vascular evaluation.
3. These signs reflect impaired arterial blood flow to the lower extremity.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Evaluation for vascular disease should include a **detailed history**, **review of symptoms**, and **physical examination**.
2. History-taking for peripheral artery disease should include questions about **walking impairment**, **intermittent claudication**, **leg weakness**, **paresthesia**, and **ischemic rest pain**.
3. **Intermittent claudication** should be differentiated from **pseudoclaudication** due to **spinal stenosis**.
4. Patients should be asked about **skin breakdown**, **foot ulcers**, and the importance of wearing **hard-soled shoes** when walking outdoors.
5. The **physical examination** for suspected peripheral artery disease should include **pulse palpation**, **auscultation for bruits**, and **inspection of the feet**.
6. **Diminished, absent, or asymmetric pulses** and **bruits** near arterial stenoses are physical findings in peripheral artery disease.
7. Patients with **chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)** may exhibit **cool extremities**, **hair loss**, **dependent rubor**, **pallor on leg elevation**, and **poor wound healing or ulcers**.
8. **Arterial leg ulcers** commonly occur on the **distal toes**, **plantar foot**, **anterior lower leg**, and **sites of trauma**.
9. **Arterial ulcers** are typically **painful**, have **sharply demarcated borders**, and a **dry, pale gray or yellow base** without granulation tissue.
10. **Chronic venous disease** can be distinguished by **leg edema**, **pigmented, brawny induration** of the gaiter zone, and **ulceration of the shin or ankle**.
11. A **systolic blood pressure difference greater than 15 mm Hg between arms** suggests **subclavian stenosis**.
12. **Palpation of abdominal aortic aneurysm** is a recommended part of the physical examination in peripheral artery disease.
13. **Palpation of bilateral peripheral pulses** should include **radial**, **brachial**, **carotid**, **femoral**, **popliteal**, **posterior tibial**, and **dorsalis pedis** arteries.
14. Inspection of the feet in PAD evaluation should include checking for **ulcers**, **fissures**, **calluses**, **tinea**, and **tendinous xanthoma**.
15. In **claudication**, discomfort is typically **exercise-induced**, occurs at a **consistent walking distance**, and is relieved by **standing or sitting** within **less than 5 minutes**.
16. In **pseudoclaudication**, discomfort may occur even when **standing still**, and is best relieved by **sitting and flexion at the waist**, typically within **30 minutes or less**.
17. **Pseudoclaudication** is more likely to involve **bilateral symptoms** and **neurologic features** such as **tingling**, **burning**, and **weakness**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This comprehensive approach improves diagnostic accuracy and ensures thorough PAD assessment.
2. These symptoms may help identify functional limitations and vascular insufficiency.
3. Differentiating the etiology of exertional leg pain prevents misdiagnosis.
4. Foot protection reduces the risk of injury and progression to CLTI.
5. These components detect both functional and structural vascular abnormalities.
6. These findings localize areas of arterial compromise.
7. These are hallmark features of advanced PAD and impaired tissue perfusion.
8. These locations have limited collateral circulation, making them vulnerable.
9. The absence of granulation tissue reflects poor vascular supply.
10. Recognizing venous stasis features helps avoid mistreatment of PAD.
11. Subclavian stenosis may present asymptomatically but is clinically important when considering limb blood pressure differences.
12. Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening is crucial due to coexisting vascular pathology in PAD patients.
13. This comprehensive pulse examination identifies asymmetry or absence suggestive of arterial obstruction.
14. These findings can reflect chronic ischemia or poor hygiene, both relevant in PAD management.
15. The hallmark of claudication is reproducibility and rapid relief with rest.
16. Pseudoclaudication typically reflects spinal neurogenic etiology and may not improve with rest alone.
17. Neurologic descriptors help differentiate spinal from vascular sources of leg pain.

    <strong>Ulcerations in Peripheral Artery Disease and Venous Stasis</strong><br>
    Arterial insufficiency ulcers (top panel) appear sharply demarcated or “punched out” with a dry pale, gray, or yellow base, and the surrounding skin is red, taut, and tender. Arterial ulcers are more likely to occur on the toes, plantar surfaces of the foot, and the heel. Venous stasis ulcers (bottom panel) are typically less painful and occur on the medial side of the lower leg (between the calf and the ankle) in areas of hyperpigmentation. Venous ulcers are typically irregularly shaped and shallow with yellow granulation tissue. They often weep serous fluid; the ulcers are rarely necrotic.
