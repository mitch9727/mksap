### 🫠 Arrhythmia: Ventricular Tachycardia ECG Recognition

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is characterized by **regular wide QRS complexes**, a **pulse rate >120/min**, and **atrioventricular (AV) dissociation** (often demonstrated by **capture** and/or **fusion beats**).
2. **VT** may be classified as **sustained** (lasting >30 seconds) or **nonsustained**, and as **monomorphic** (same QRS morphology throughout) or **polymorphic** (variable QRS morphology).
3. The development of **VT** is facilitated by **abnormal ventricular conduction** and/or **myocardial scar tissue**.
4. **VT** usually occurs in patients with **structural heart disease**, including **ischemic** and **nonischemic cardiomyopathy**.
5. On ECG, a **fusion beat**, **abrupt axis change**, and **QRS widening** can mark the onset of **VT**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. AV dissociation confirms the ventricular origin of the rhythm; fusion and capture beats are hallmark features.
2. **Torsades de pointes** is an example of polymorphic VT that twists around the baseline.
3. Myocardial scar tissue creates a substrate for reentrant circuits, a common mechanism for VT.
4. Conditions like prior myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy are typical structural substrates.
5. The ECG showed transition to VT one third through the tracing, marked by a fusion beat.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is a **wide-complex** tachycardia (QRS ≥120 ms), typically **monomorphic**, that originates from the **ventricles**.
2. **VT** usually occurs in patients with **structural heart disease**, including **ischemic** or **nonischemic cardiomyopathy**.
3. **Sustained VT (≥30 seconds)** can lead to **hypotension**, **syncope**, **ventricular fibrillation**, or **cardiac arrest**.
4. The **absence of symptoms or hemodynamic compromise** does **not exclude VT** as a diagnosis.
5. **Idiopathic VT**, occurring without structural heart disease, often arises from the **ventricular outflow tracts**, **fascicles**, or **papillary muscles**, and presents with **palpitations** but rarely **syncope**.
6. **Emotional stress**, **sleeplessness**, and **exercise** are common triggers of **idiopathic VT**.
7. In adults with known **structural heart disease**, **95% of wide-complex tachycardias** are **VT**.
8. In patients without structural heart disease, **ECG features** like **AV dissociation**, **fusion beats**, and **capture beats** help distinguish **VT** from other wide-complex tachycardias.
9. If the etiology of a **wide-complex tachycardia** is uncertain, it should be treated as **VT** to guide management.
10. **Differential diagnosis** for wide-complex tachycardia includes **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction**, **preexcited SVT (antidromic)**, and **ventricular paced rhythms**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Monomorphic VT has consistent QRS morphology, helping differentiate it from polymorphic forms.
3. Sudden drops in cardiac output during VT can result in dangerous clinical deterioration.
4. Diagnosis of VT must rely on ECG morphology, not symptoms alone.
5. Idiopathic VT is most common in younger patients with no structural disease.
6. These triggers suggest heightened sympathetic tone may contribute to arrhythmogenesis.
7. In such patients, empiric treatment for VT is typically appropriate even without further testing.
8. Fusion and capture beats are seen when sinus and ventricular impulses momentarily coincide.
9. Treating as VT avoids inappropriate therapies like AV nodal blockers that may worsen arrhythmias.
10. Misdiagnosing SVT with aberrancy as VT can result in unnecessary defibrillation, but the reverse is more dangerous.
