### 🫀 Cardiology: Junctional Rhythm Identification

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **junctional (atrioventricular nodal) rhythm** is a regular supraventricular rhythm in which the **P wave in lead II is negative** and may appear immediately **before or after the QRS complex**, or the **P wave may be absent**.
2. An **atrioventricular nodal escape rhythm** is present when the junctional pacemaker rate is **40 to 60 beats per minute (bpm)** and assumes pacing because the **sinoatrial (SA) node** is delayed or fails to discharge.
3. An **accelerated junctional rhythm** is defined when the junctional rate is **61 to 99 bpm** and the atrioventricular node supersedes the SA node as the pacemaker.
4. **Junctional tachycardia** is diagnosed when the junctional rate is **100 bpm or faster**, with the atrioventricular node acting as the dominant pacemaker.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Negative or absent P waves reflect **retrograde atrial activation** originating from the atrioventricular junction.
2. Escape rhythms are a protective mechanism that maintains cardiac output when the **SA node** fails.
3. Causes of accelerated junctional rhythm include **enhanced automaticity** from conditions such as **digitalis toxicity** or **post‑operative cardiac injury**.
4. Junctional tachycardia may occur with **digoxin toxicity**, **myocarditis**, or **catecholamine excess**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block** is defined as a **PR interval >200 milliseconds**.
2. **First-degree AV block** is associated with increased risk for **atrial fibrillation (AF)** and **all-cause mortality**, despite being usually asymptomatic.
3. **Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block (Wenckebach)** is characterized by **progressive PR prolongation** until a **dropped QRS complex**.
4. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** involves **intermittent nonconducted P waves** with **constant PR intervals**.
5. **Mobitz type 2** occurs below the AV node and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
6. **Third-degree AV block (complete heart block)** is defined by **no P waves conducting to the ventricles**, leading to **AV dissociation**.
7. **High-degree AV block** refers to multiple consecutive **nonconducted P waves**.
8. **Infranodal conduction disease** includes **Mobitz type 2**, **third-degree AV block**, and **bundle branch blocks**.
9. **Left or right bundle branch block**, as well as **fascicular blocks**, may reflect **significant underlying heart disease**, particularly if progressive.
10. **Surface ECG changes** such as QRS morphology alterations should be evaluated in context of **symptoms** and **cardiovascular history**.
11. **First-degree AV block** is defined by a **PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds** and is typically asymptomatic.
12. First-degree AV block is associated with an **increased risk of atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality**.
13. **Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block** is characterized by **progressive prolongation of the PR interval** until a **nonconducted P wave** results in a **dropped QRS complex**.
14. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** is characterized by **intermittent nonconducted P waves with a fixed PR interval**.
15. **2:1 AV block** cannot reliably distinguish between Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2.
16. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically occurs **below the AV node** and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
17. **High-degree AV block** refers to more than one consecutive nonconducted P wave, with **several P waves not followed by QRS complexes**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Cohort studies have linked first-degree AV block to **long-term adverse outcomes** despite being a benign ECG finding.
5. Mobitz type 2 is considered **high risk** and may require pacing even if asymptomatic.
8–9. Bundle branch blocks alone are not equivalent to high-grade AV block, but **progressive conduction abnormalities** suggest possible **structural or ischemic heart disease**.
11. A PR interval >200 ms signifies delayed AV conduction but does not affect all ventricular depolarizations.
12. Longitudinal studies support increased morbidity despite lack of immediate symptoms in first-degree AV block.
13. Grouped beating is a key visual feature of Mobitz type 1 on ECG.
14. Mobitz type 2 may appear similar to 2:1 block but has fixed PR intervals and sudden dropped beats.
15. In 2:1 block, every other P wave fails to conduct, making classification difficult without additional evidence.
16. Mobitz type 2 often originates in or below the His-Purkinje system and warrants close monitoring or pacemaker evaluation.
17. High-degree block is often a prelude to third-degree block and represents advanced conduction disease.

The latter findings indicate disease in the left bundle branch system also (and possibly the His bundle). In summary, this patient’s atrioventricular conduction is “hanging by a thread.”
