### 🫀 Arrhythmias: Sinus Tachycardia

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Sinus tachycardia** is defined as a **sinus rhythm** with a **heart rate ≥100/min**.
2. Sinus rhythm is characterized by a **normal P-wave axis**, an **upright P wave in lead II**, and a **constant PR interval**.
3. **Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)** is typically characterized by a **short RP interval** and a **retrograde P wave very close to the QRS complex**.
4. **Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)** is typically characterized by a **short PR interval** and **slurring of the initial QRS complex** due to conduction over an accessory pathway.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The diagnosis of sinus tachycardia is supported by consistent, normal P wave morphology.
3. These features distinguish AVNRT from sinus tachycardia and help avoid misdiagnosis.
4. AVRT often involves an accessory pathway such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, contributing to the characteristic QRS changes.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Sinus tachycardia** is the most common tachycardia and typically results from **physiologic demand or distress**.
2. Common causes of sinus tachycardia include **pain**, **hypovolemia**, **anemia**, **substance intoxication or withdrawal**, **endocrine derangements** (e.g., **hyperthyroidism**), and **acute cardiopulmonary events** (e.g., **pulmonary embolism**).
3. Benign causes of sinus tachycardia include **exercise**, **anxiety**, and **dysautonomia**, which should only be considered after more serious causes are excluded.
4. Treatment of sinus tachycardia should primarily address the **underlying cause**, and empiric **heart rate reduction** with medications such as **β-blockers** is discouraged.
5. **Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)** is characterized by an **elevated resting heart rate** and **exaggerated heart rate increases with light activity**.
6. IST typically affects **women in their second to fourth decade** and may cause **palpitations**, **light-headedness**, **syncope**, **dyspnea**, or **fatigue**.
7. Diagnosis of IST requires exclusion of **secondary causes of tachycardia**, such as **hyperthyroidism**, **anemia**, **pheochromocytoma**, and **structural heart disease**.
8. First-line therapy for IST includes **removal of aggravating factors** and **exercise therapy**.
9. **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)** is a form of **dysautonomia** characterized by **orthostatic intolerance** and **excessive tachycardia**, particularly upon standing.
10. Diagnostic criteria for POTS include an increase in heart rate of **≥30/min** or to **>120/min within 10 minutes of standing**.
11. Behavioral therapy for POTS includes **compression stockings**, **exercise training**, and **increased fluid intake**.
12. Medical therapies for POTS may include **β-blockers**, **ivabradine**, **fludrocortisone**, **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**, **midodrine**, **droxidopa**, and **pyridostigmine**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Sinus tachycardia is not always benign; it may indicate serious underlying illness.
4. β-blockers and other rate-controlling agents are typically avoided unless needed for symptom control or specific arrhythmias.
5. IST is distinct from sinus tachycardia due to physiologic causes and often occurs in structurally normal hearts.
7. IST is a diagnosis of exclusion and should only be made after ruling out other reversible causes.
10. POTS diagnosis requires heart rate response during active standing or tilt testing.
12. Most POTS medications are off-label and should be used with specialist oversight; ivabradine is contraindicated in pregnancy.
