### 🫠 Cardiac Electrophysiology: Mobitz Type 1 Second‑Degree Atrioventricular Block

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Mobitz type 1 second‑degree atrioventricular (AV) block**, also called **Wenckebach**, is characterized on electrocardiogram by **progressive PR‑interval prolongation** culminating in a **nonconducted P wave** and a dropped **QRS complex**.
2. In **Mobitz type 1 AV block**, the **shortest PR interval** occurs in the beat *immediately after* the dropped QRS complex, and the PR interval **lengthens with each subsequent conducted beat** until the next block.
3. **Mobitz type 2 second‑degree AV block** presents with a **fixed PR interval** preceding each dropped QRS complex, distinguishing it from Mobitz type 1.
4. **High‑degree atrioventricular block** is defined by **two or more consecutive nonconducted P waves**, producing several atrial depolarisations without ventricular conduction.
5. **Complete (third‑degree) heart block** exhibits **absent atrioventricular conduction** with **atrial–ventricular dissociation**, resulting in an independent ventricular escape rhythm.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Comparing the **longest PR interval** (just before the dropped beat) with the **shortest PR interval** (just after the dropped beat) is the simplest way to recognise the Wenckebach pattern.
2. The repeating cycle of PR‑interval prolongation and dropped beats produces **grouped beating** (e.g., 6 : 5 or 5 : 4 conduction ratios) on rhythm strips.
3. Mobitz type 2 AV block usually reflects **infranodal His‑Purkinje disease** and carries a **higher risk of progression** to complete heart block than Mobitz type 1.
4. High‑degree AV block often causes **symptomatic bradycardia** and may necessitate **urgent temporary pacing**.
5. In complete heart block, the intrinsic **ventricular escape rhythm** is typically **slow and unreliable**, so **permanent pacemaker implantation** is indicated.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block** is defined as a **PR interval >200 milliseconds**.
2. **First-degree AV block** is associated with increased risk for **atrial fibrillation (AF)** and **all-cause mortality**, despite being usually asymptomatic.
3. **Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block (Wenckebach)** is characterized by **progressive PR prolongation** until a **dropped QRS complex**.
4. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** involves **intermittent nonconducted P waves** with **constant PR intervals**.
5. **Mobitz type 2** occurs below the AV node and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
6. **Third-degree AV block (complete heart block)** is defined by **no P waves conducting to the ventricles**, leading to **AV dissociation**.
7. **High-degree AV block** refers to multiple consecutive **nonconducted P waves**.
8. **Infranodal conduction disease** includes **Mobitz type 2**, **third-degree AV block**, and **bundle branch blocks**.
9. **Left or right bundle branch block**, as well as **fascicular blocks**, may reflect **significant underlying heart disease**, particularly if progressive.
10. **Surface ECG changes** such as QRS morphology alterations should be evaluated in context of **symptoms** and **cardiovascular history**.
11. **First-degree AV block** is defined by a **PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds** and is typically asymptomatic.
12. First-degree AV block is associated with an **increased risk of atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality**.
13. **Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block** is characterized by **progressive prolongation of the PR interval** until a **nonconducted P wave** results in a **dropped QRS complex**.
14. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** is characterized by **intermittent nonconducted P waves with a fixed PR interval**.
15. **2:1 AV block** cannot reliably distinguish between Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2.
16. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically occurs **below the AV node** and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
17. **High-degree AV block** refers to more than one consecutive nonconducted P wave, with **several P waves not followed by QRS complexes**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Cohort studies have linked first-degree AV block to **long-term adverse outcomes** despite being a benign ECG finding.
5. Mobitz type 2 is considered **high risk** and may require pacing even if asymptomatic.
8–9. Bundle branch blocks alone are not equivalent to high-grade AV block, but **progressive conduction abnormalities** suggest possible **structural or ischemic heart disease**.
11. A PR interval >200 ms signifies delayed AV conduction but does not affect all ventricular depolarizations.
12. Longitudinal studies support increased morbidity despite lack of immediate symptoms in first-degree AV block.
13. Grouped beating is a key visual feature of Mobitz type 1 on ECG.
14. Mobitz type 2 may appear similar to 2:1 block but has fixed PR intervals and sudden dropped beats.
15. In 2:1 block, every other P wave fails to conduct, making classification difficult without additional evidence.
16. Mobitz type 2 often originates in or below the His-Purkinje system and warrants close monitoring or pacemaker evaluation.
17. High-degree block is often a prelude to third-degree block and represents advanced conduction disease.
