### 🫀 Arrhythmias: Long QT Syndrome Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **QT interval** that exceeds one‑half of the adjacent **R‑R interval** indicates **QT prolongation**.
2. When the heart rate is between 60/min and 100/min, the **corrected QT interval (QTc)** is calculated by dividing the measured QT interval by the square root of the **R‑R interval** in seconds.
3. A **QTc ≤440 ms in men** and **≤460 ms in women** is considered normal.
4. **Genetic long QT syndrome (LQTS)** is one of the most common inherited arrhythmias, occurring in approximately **1 in 1000 to 1 in 5000 persons**.
5. Clinical features suggestive of **genetic LQTS** include **syncope during sleep, auditory stimulation, or exercise** (depending on subtype), **QTc usually >460 ms**, and a propensity for **torsades de pointes**.
6. **QT prolongation** has many acquired causes, including **medications, structural heart disease, and electrolyte abnormalities**; therefore, prolonged QTc alone is insufficient to diagnose **genetic LQTS**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. In the presented case of recurrent exertional syncope with QT prolongation on ECG, long QT syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients **younger than 40 years** without ischemic or structural heart disease who experience **unexplained cardiac arrest, near‑drowning, exercise‑related syncope, or recurrent high‑risk syncope** should be evaluated for **inherited arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy syndromes**.
2. **Unexplained premature death (<35 years)** or **sudden death (<40 years)** in a first‑degree relative warrants suspicion for an **inherited arrhythmia syndrome** and prompts **specialist referral with genetic counseling and testing**.
3. The diagnosis of **inherited arrhythmia syndromes** is complicated by **variable penetrance and expressivity**.
4. **Genetic LQTS** affects **1 in 1000–5000 persons**, but a **prolonged QTc (>440 ms in men, >460 ms in women) alone** is **insufficient for diagnosis** because the QT interval is variable and can be prolonged by **medications, structural heart disease, or electrolyte disturbances**.
5. Initial treatment of **genetic LQTS** includes **β‑blocker therapy** and **avoidance of QT‑prolonging drugs**; selected patients may require an **implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator, surgical sympathectomy, or exercise restriction**.
6. **Brugada syndrome** is identified by **≥2 mm J‑point elevation with downsloping ST‑segment coving in leads V1–V3**, occurs more frequently in persons of **Asian descent**, and is associated with **night‑time arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death**.
7. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** and **arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D)** can present as **sudden cardiac death** in young individuals; patients with ARVC/D should **avoid vigorous exercise** and those with risk factors should receive an **implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator**.
8. First‑line pharmacologic therapy for **ventricular arrhythmias in ARVC/D** is a **β‑blocker**; **sotalol, amiodarone,** or **catheter ablation** may be required for recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
9. **Brugada syndrome** treatment includes an **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)**, careful avoidance or management of precipitating triggers (for example, certain drugs or fever), and **catheter ablation** in selected patients.
10. **Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)** presents with syncope and **polymorphic or bidirectional VT** during exercise or emotional distress; optimal management involves **β-blockers, verapamil, flecainide, ICD implantation, and strict exercise abstinence**.
11. Prevention of sudden death in **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** may require **ICD placement, β-blockers, disopyramide, catheter ablation, or surgical myectomy**.
12. **Long QT syndrome** commonly causes syncope triggered by sleep, auditory stimuli, or exercise (depending on the genetic subtype) and is characterized by a corrected QT interval (**QTc**) usually **> 460 ms** with risk of torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia.
13. Management of **Long QT syndrome** includes **β-adrenergic-receptor blockers (β-blockers)** and avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs; selected high-risk patients may additionally require an **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)**, left cardiac sympathetic denervation, or exercise restriction.
14. **Brugada syndrome** presents with syncope during sleep or with ventricular fibrillation and shows a coved ST-segment elevation pattern in right-sided precordial leads **V₁–V₃** on electrocardiogram.
15. Primary treatment for **Brugada syndrome** is ICD implantation together with avoidance—or prompt management—of precipitating factors such as fever or sodium-channel-blocking drugs; catheter ablation of the right-ventricular outflow-tract substrate may be considered in selected cases.
16. **Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)** manifests as syncope or polymorphic/bidirectional ventricular tachycardia provoked by physical exercise or emotional distress.
17. Therapy for **CPVT** includes **β-blockers** (first-line), with possible addition of **verapamil** or **flecainide**, ICD implantation, and universal avoidance of vigorous exercise.
18. **Arrhythmogenic right-ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D)** may present with syncope, palpitations, T-wave inversions in leads **V₁–V₃**, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, frequent premature ventricular complexes, and right-ventricular structural or functional abnormalities on echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (**CMR**).
19. Treatment of **ARVC/D** often involves an ICD, **β-blockers**, antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and strict avoidance of competitive or high-intensity exercise.
20. **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)** can present with syncope or ventricular fibrillation during exercise and is associated with increased QRS voltage with or without repolarization abnormalities on electrocardiogram.
21. Therapeutic options for **HCM** include ICD placement, **β-blockers**, **disopyramide**, septal reduction therapy via catheter ablation, and surgical myectomy.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Evaluation typically includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing as recommended by current guidelines.
4. QTc thresholds serve as a screening tool but are not diagnostic in isolation.
5. **β‑Blockers** blunt adrenergic surges that trigger **torsades de pointes** episodes in LQTS.
6. Fever or pharmacologic sodium‑channel blockade can unmask the Brugada ECG pattern.
9. Comprehensive evaluation for inherited arrhythmia syndromes typically includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and targeted genetic testing.
10. QTc thresholds are useful for screening but are not solely diagnostic because many acquired factors can prolong the QT interval.
11. **β-Blockers** blunt adrenergic surges that precipitate torsades de pointes episodes in long-QT syndrome.
