### 🫀 Cardiac Conduction: Third-Degree Heart Block

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block** is characterized by **dissociation between the P waves and QRS complexes** on electrocardiogram (ECG).
2. In third-degree AV block, **P waves discharge at their intrinsic atrial rate** but are **not conducted to the ventricles**.
3. A **narrow QRS complex** in third-degree AV block suggests the level of block is at the **His bundle**.
4. A **wide QRS complex** in third-degree AV block suggests a block **below the His bundle**.
5. When third-degree AV block occurs below the His bundle, the **ventricular escape rate** is typically **between 30 and 40 beats per minute**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This finding distinguishes third-degree AV block from second-degree blocks, which maintain some conduction.
2. Atrioventricular dissociation is a hallmark of complete (third-degree) AV block.
3. Junctional escape rhythms from the AV node or His bundle typically generate narrow QRS complexes.
4. Ventricular escape rhythms from distal conduction tissue or myocardium are associated with wide QRS complexes.
5. Slower ventricular rates in infra-Hisian blocks reflect reliance on distal pacemaker cells.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree AV block** is defined by a **PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds** and is typically asymptomatic.
2. First-degree AV block is associated with an **increased risk of atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality**.
3. **Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block** is characterized by **progressive prolongation of the PR interval** until a **nonconducted P wave** results in a **dropped QRS complex**.
4. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** is characterized by **intermittent nonconducted P waves with a fixed PR interval**.
5. **2:1 AV block** cannot reliably distinguish between Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2.
6. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically occurs **below the AV node** and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
7. **High-degree AV block** refers to more than one consecutive nonconducted P wave, with **several P waves not followed by QRS complexes**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A PR interval >200 ms signifies delayed AV conduction but does not affect all ventricular depolarizations.
2. Longitudinal studies support increased morbidity despite lack of immediate symptoms in first-degree AV block.
3. Grouped beating is a key visual feature of Mobitz type 1 on ECG.
4. Mobitz type 2 may appear similar to 2:1 block but has fixed PR intervals and sudden dropped beats.
5. In 2:1 block, every other P wave fails to conduct, making classification difficult without additional evidence.
6. Mobitz type 2 often originates in or below the His-Purkinje system and warrants close monitoring or pacemaker evaluation.
7. High-degree block is often a prelude to third-degree block and represents advanced conduction disease.

    ECG showing Mobitz type 1 second-degree atrioventricular (Wenckebach) block, which manifests as a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until there is a dropped ventricular beat (arrow).

       alt="ECG tracing of Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block with intermittent blocked P waves and fixed PR interval">
  <figcaption>
    P waves are blocked intermittently (arrows), and the PR interval is fixed. Although 2 : 1 block can be a manifestation of Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block, note the wide QRS complexes, which are more consistent with block below the compact atrioventricular node.

  <figcaption>
    The rhythm strip shows constant PR interval (brackets) with intermittent dropped beats and nonconducted P waves (arrows). These findings are consistent with Mobitz type 2 second-degree heart block.

  <figcaption>
    In this ECG, the P waves (short arrows) and the QRS complexes (long arrows) are not associated with each other, indicating the presence of complete heart block.

<!-- ECG Demonstrating Substantial Conduction System Disease at High Risk of Progression -->
<figure>
  <img src="ECG Showing High-Risk Conduction System Disease.jpg"
       alt="ECG tracing showing right bundle‑branch block, borderline PR interval, and possible left posterior fascicular block, suggesting widespread conduction system disease">
  <figcaption>
    The tracing shows right bundle branch block with evidence of disease elsewhere in the conduction system, including borderline PR interval and possibly left posterior fascicular block. The latter findings indicate disease in the left bundle branch system also (and possibly the His bundle). In summary, this patient’s atrioventricular conduction is “hanging by a thread.”
