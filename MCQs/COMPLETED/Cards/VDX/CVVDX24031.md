### 🫀 Arrhythmias: Ventricular Fibrillation and Ventricular Tachycardia

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular fibrillation (VF)** is characterized on electrocardiogram (ECG) by the absence of organized ventricular waveforms and the presence of bizarre, irregular, and random waves.
2. **Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)**, such as **torsades de pointes**, displays highly variable QRS complexes with recognizable ventricular activity.
3. **Accelerated junctional rhythm** and **monomorphic VT** both show easily recognizable and discrete ventricular waveforms on ECG.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The diagnosis of VF is made based on the lack of identifiable organized ventricular activity on ECG.
2. In polymorphic VT, QRS axis rotation creates a variable appearance, but ventricular rhythm remains discernible.
3. These rhythms are distinguished from VF by the presence of consistent waveforms on ECG.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is a wide-complex (QRS complex ≥120 ms), usually monomorphic tachycardia originating from the ventricles.
2. VT development is facilitated by **abnormal ventricular conduction** and/or **myocardial scar tissue** and commonly occurs in patients with **structural heart disease**, including **ischemic** and **nonischemic cardiomyopathy**.
3. **Sustained VT** (lasting ≥30 seconds) may result in **hypotension**, **syncope**, **ventricular fibrillation**, or **cardiac arrest**.
4. The absence of symptoms or hemodynamic instability does not exclude VT as a diagnosis.
5. **Idiopathic VT**, occurring in the absence of structural heart disease, typically originates from the **ventricular outflow tracts**, **fascicles**, or **papillary muscles**.
6. Patients with idiopathic VT usually present in their **third to fifth decades of life** with **palpitations**, and **syncope is uncommon**.
7. VT should be distinguished from other causes of **wide-complex tachycardia**, such as **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy**, **preexcited SVT**, and **ventricular paced rhythms**.
8. In adult patients with known structural heart disease, **95% of wide-complex tachycardias are VT**, and further diagnostic criteria are often unnecessary.
9. In patients without known structural heart disease, **atrioventricular (AV) dissociation**, **fusion beats**, and **capture beats** can help distinguish VT from other rhythms.
10. When the origin of a wide-complex tachycardia is uncertain, it should be treated as VT.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Monomorphic VT refers to a consistent QRS morphology throughout the rhythm.
2. Structural abnormalities in the myocardium serve as the substrate for reentrant or abnormal automaticity VT.
3. Sustained VT poses a risk of hemodynamic compromise and death.
4. Clinical stability does not guarantee benign arrhythmia.
5. Idiopathic VT is generally seen in structurally normal hearts and has focal rather than reentrant mechanisms.
6. The demographic pattern and symptoms of idiopathic VT differ from structural VT.
7. Differential diagnosis for wide-complex tachycardia includes both ventricular and supraventricular mechanisms.
8. Structural heart disease is a strong predictor that a wide-complex rhythm is ventricular in origin.
9. ECG signs like AV dissociation, fusion, or capture beats improve diagnostic specificity.
10. Management decisions prioritize safety by presuming VT in ambiguous cases.
