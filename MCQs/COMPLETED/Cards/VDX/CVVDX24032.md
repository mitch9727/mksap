### 🫠 Cardiac Electrophysiology: Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome** is characterized by an **accessory pathway** that bypasses the **atrioventricular (AV) node**, leading to **ventricular preexcitation**.
2. **Ventricular preexcitation** in WPW results in a **short PR interval** and a **delta wave** at the beginning of the **QRS complex** on electrocardiogram (ECG).
3. On ECG, **positive delta waves** with a short PR interval are typically seen in leads **I, II, aVL**, and **precordial leads V2 through V6** in WPW syndrome.
4. **Negative delta waves**, appearing as an initial negative deflection of the QRS complex, can be seen in leads **III, aVF, and aVR** in WPW, potentially mimicking an **inferior infarct pattern**.
5. The combination of **WPW pattern on ECG** and **symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia** defines **Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The accessory pathway allows electrical conduction to bypass the normal AV nodal delay, leading to early ventricular activation.
2. A delta wave is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex due to early activation of the ventricles via the accessory pathway.
3. These ECG findings indicate a left-sided accessory pathway.
4. This pseudo-infarct pattern may lead to misdiagnosis without recognition of the preexcitation pattern.
5. Symptoms typically include palpitations or tachycardia, and the diagnosis is confirmed when WPW pattern is present on resting ECG in a symptomatic individual.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)** is an accessory pathway–mediated tachycardia often associated with **preexcitation (delta wave)** on electrocardiogram (ECG).
2. **Orthodromic AVRT** (anterograde conduction over the atrioventricular node) accounts for **90% to 95%** of AVRT cases and is associated with a **narrow QRS complex**.
3. **Antidromic AVRT** (anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway) accounts for the remaining cases and results in a **wide QRS complex**.
4. **Rapid conduction over an accessory pathway in atrial fibrillation (AF)** can cause **ventricular fibrillation (VF)** and **sudden cardiac death (SCD)** in WPW syndrome.
5. The **success rate for catheter ablation** in WPW syndrome is **high**, though it depends on the **location of the accessory pathway**.
6. In **asymptomatic patients** with preexcitation, invasive testing is typically reserved for those with **high-risk occupations**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Delta waves reflect early ventricular activation through the accessory pathway before normal atrioventricular conduction.
2. Orthodromic conduction produces a narrow-complex tachycardia as the impulse travels down the AV node and back up the accessory pathway.
3. Antidromic conduction produces a wide-complex tachycardia as the impulse travels anterogradely down the accessory pathway.
4. This risk is the basis for recommending curative therapy even in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients in selected cases.
5. Certain accessory pathway locations, such as septal or mid-septal pathways, may pose greater technical challenges.
6. Examples of high-risk occupations include commercial airline pilots and military personnel.
