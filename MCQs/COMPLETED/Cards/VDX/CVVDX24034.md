### 🦠 Vascular Medicine: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Evaluation and Surveillance

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **normal maximal diameter of the abdominal aorta** is **less than 3 cm**.
2. **Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** is **absent** when the aortic diameter is **less than 3 cm** on ultrasonography.
3. **Abdominal ultrasonography** measures aortic diameter **from outer wall to outer wall**.
4. On ultrasound, the **abdominal aorta** appears **round, smooth, and anechoic** and lies **anterior to the vertebral bodies**.
5. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **one-time screening** for AAA using **duplex ultrasonography** in **men aged 65–75 years who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes** during their lifetime.
6. The USPSTF recommends **selective screening** for AAA in **men aged 65–75 years who have never smoked**.
7. **Approximately 75% of patients with AAA are asymptomatic** at the time of diagnosis.
8. **AAA is most often diagnosed incidentally** by **computed tomography angiography (CTA)** or **abdominal ultrasonography**.
9. In patients with **AAA diameter <4.0 cm**, surveillance with **duplex ultrasonography every 2 to 3 years** is recommended.
10. In patients with **AAA diameter 4.0–4.9 cm**, **CTA or duplex ultrasonography should be performed every 12 months**.
11. In **men with AAA diameter 5.0 to <5.5 cm**, **CTA or duplex ultrasonography should be performed every 6 months**.
12. When the **aortic diameter is ≥5.5 cm in men** or **≥5.0 cm in women**, **CTA or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** is indicated to determine the **location of the aneurysm** for repair planning.

#### 💬 Extra
1. In the referenced ultrasound, the aorta measured **1.85 cm** in diameter and was therefore classified as **normal in size**.
2. The **vertebral bodies** appear **hyperechoic** with **posterior acoustic shadowing** on ultrasound.
12. Repair planning depends on determining if the AAA is **suprarenal, juxtarenal, or infrarenal**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **estimated annual risk for aortic rupture increases with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter**.
2. **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)** or **magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** is indicated to determine the **anatomical location** of an AAA once it reaches the **surgical repair threshold**.
3. AAA rupture carries a **high mortality rate**, which is the basis for **screening and surveillance recommendations**.
4. **Duplex ultrasonography** is the **preferred modality** for **initial screening** and **interval surveillance** of AAA.
5. For a more detailed discussion of AAA screening, clinicians are referred to **“Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm” in the Foundations of Clinical Practice** section.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Larger aneurysms are associated with **greater wall tension** and **higher rupture risk**, justifying more frequent imaging.
2. Knowing whether an AAA is **suprarenal**, **juxtarenal**, or **infrarenal** helps determine **eligibility for endovascular vs surgical repair**.
3. The **asymptomatic nature** of most AAAs at diagnosis necessitates **proactive screening** to prevent rupture-related deaths.
4. Duplex ultrasonography is **noninvasive**, **radiation-free**, and **cost-effective**, making it suitable for serial evaluation.
5. The “Foundations of Clinical Practice” section in MKSAP provides a more comprehensive overview of **AAA guidelines and rationale**.
