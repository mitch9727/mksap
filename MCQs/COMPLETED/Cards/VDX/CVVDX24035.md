### 🫠 Cardiac Conduction: Left Posterior Fascicular Block

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left posterior fascicular block** occurs when conduction disease involves the **posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch**.
2. **Left posterior fascicular block** is defined by a **right axis deviation greater than +90 degrees** with **no other cause**, such as **right ventricular hypertrophy**.
3. In **left posterior fascicular block**, the **QRS duration is less than 120 milliseconds**.
4. In **left posterior fascicular block**, leads **I and aVL** show a **negative QRS complex** with a **small R wave and deep S wave**.
5. In **left posterior fascicular block**, leads **III and aVF** demonstrate a **qR pattern**.
6. **Left anterior fascicular block** is characterized by a **positive QRS complex in lead I** and a **negative QRS complex in lead aVF**.
7. **Bifascicular block** refers to the combination of a **right bundle branch conduction disturbance** and either **left anterior** or **left posterior fascicular block**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The fascicles are branches of the left bundle branch that separately conduct electrical impulses to different regions of the left ventricle.
2. Axis deviation must be interpreted in the absence of other conditions (e.g., RVH) that could explain the ECG findings.
3. A narrow QRS complex helps differentiate fascicular blocks from other intraventricular conduction delays.
4. The negative QRS pattern in lateral leads reflects delayed posterior activation.
5. A qR pattern in inferior leads is consistent with posterior fascicular conduction delay.
6. This contrasts with left posterior fascicular block, which shows opposite axis deviation.
7. Recognition of bifascicular block is important as it may indicate more advanced conduction system disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree AV block** is defined by a **PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds** and is typically asymptomatic.
2. First-degree AV block is associated with an **increased risk of atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality**.
3. **Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block** is characterized by **progressive prolongation of the PR interval** until a **nonconducted P wave** results in a **dropped QRS complex**.
4. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** is characterized by **intermittent nonconducted P waves with a fixed PR interval**.
5. **2:1 AV block** cannot reliably distinguish between Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2.
6. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically occurs **below the AV node** and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
7. **High-degree AV block** refers to more than one consecutive nonconducted P wave, with **several P waves not followed by QRS complexes**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A PR interval >200 ms signifies delayed AV conduction but does not affect all ventricular depolarizations.
2. Longitudinal studies support increased morbidity despite lack of immediate symptoms in first-degree AV block.
3. Grouped beating is a key visual feature of Mobitz type 1 on ECG.
4. Mobitz type 2 may appear similar to 2:1 block but has fixed PR intervals and sudden dropped beats.
5. In 2:1 block, every other P wave fails to conduct, making classification difficult without additional evidence.
6. Mobitz type 2 often originates in or below the His-Purkinje system and warrants close monitoring or pacemaker evaluation.
7. High-degree block is often a prelude to third-degree block and represents advanced conduction disease.

    ECG showing Mobitz type 1 second-degree atrioventricular (Wenckebach) block, which manifests as a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until there is a dropped ventricular beat (arrow).

       alt="ECG tracing of Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block with intermittent blocked P waves and fixed PR interval">
  <figcaption>
    P waves are blocked intermittently (arrows), and the PR interval is fixed. Although 2 : 1 block can be a manifestation of Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block, note the wide QRS complexes, which are more consistent with block below the compact atrioventricular node.

  <figcaption>
    The rhythm strip shows constant PR interval (brackets) with intermittent dropped beats and nonconducted P waves (arrows). These findings are consistent with Mobitz type 2 second-degree heart block.

       alt="ECG tracing demonstrating complete heart block with AV dissociation between P waves and QRS complexes">
  <figcaption>
    In this ECG, the P waves (short arrows) and the QRS complexes (long arrows) are not associated with each other, indicating the presence of complete heart block.

<!-- ECG Demonstrating Substantial Conduction System Disease at High Risk of Progression -->
<figure>
  <img src="ECG Showing High-Risk Conduction System Disease.jpg"
       alt="ECG tracing showing right bundle‑branch block, borderline PR interval, and possible left posterior fascicular block, suggesting widespread conduction system disease">
  <figcaption>
    The tracing shows right bundle branch block with evidence of disease elsewhere in the conduction system, including borderline PR interval and possibly left posterior fascicular block. The latter findings indicate disease in the left bundle branch system also (and possibly the His bundle). In summary, this patient’s atrioventricular conduction is “hanging by a thread.”
