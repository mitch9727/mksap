### 🫀 Cardiology: Prior Lateral Myocardial Infarction

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Deep **Q waves** in leads **I, aVL, and V6** on a 12‑lead **electrocardiogram (ECG)** are characteristic findings of a **prior lateral myocardial infarction (MI)**.
2. In a prior lateral myocardial infarction, **pathologic Q‑wave changes** are typically absent in the **anterior and posterior precordial leads (V1–V3)** and the **inferior leads (II, III, aVF)**.
3. A prior lateral myocardial infarction is not associated with **dynamic ST‑segment or T‑wave changes** that signify **acute myocardial ischemia**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Pathologic Q waves represent electrically inactive scar tissue that results from transmural necrosis after a completed myocardial infarction.
2. The distribution of pathologic Q waves corresponds to infarcted myocardium supplied predominantly by branches of the **left circumflex artery**, sparing anterior and inferior territories.
3. Dynamic ST‑segment elevation, depression, or T‑wave inversion indicates ongoing ischemia; their absence helps distinguish a remote infarct from an acute event.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)** is diagnosed by **ST-segment elevation of ≥1 mm in two or more contiguous limb or chest leads**, except in leads **V2 and V3**, where the threshold is **≥2 mm in men** and **≥1.5 mm in women**.
2. **New left bundle branch block (LBBB)** may be considered a **STEMI equivalent**, suggesting **acute left anterior descending artery occlusion** or **extensive myocardial injury**.
3. In patients with **preexisting left bundle branch block (LBBB)** or **paced rhythms**, **STEMI diagnosis by ECG is less reliable**.
4. **Right bundle branch block (RBBB)** does **not obscure ST-segment elevation patterns** on ECG.
5. A **posterior myocardial infarction (MI)** is indicated by **ST-segment depression >2 mm in leads V1-V4** with **tall R waves**, and may involve **posterior, lateral, and inferior walls**.
6. The **De Winter sign** (tall, symmetric T waves) and **Wellens sign** (deeply inverted or biphasic anterior T waves) suggest **high-risk left anterior descending artery disease** and may evolve to **ST-segment elevation** on serial ECGs.
7. **Acute pericarditis** is associated with **concave ST-segment elevation** and **PR-segment depression**, which may mimic **STEMI**.
8. **Pericarditis or myopericarditis** can cause **cardiac enzyme elevation**, necessitating differentiation from STEMI using **clinical features and ECG**.
9. **Acute aortic syndromes** may cause **ST-segment elevation** if **coronary arteries are involved**, and can be identified by **differential upper extremity blood pressures**, **tearing chest pain**, and **mediastinal widening** on chest radiograph.
10. **Severe hypercalcemia** may mimic acute coronary syndrome with **ST-segment elevation**, and is typically associated with **short QT interval** and **flattened T waves** on ECG.

#### 💬 Extra
1. ST-elevation thresholds differ for leads V2-V3 due to normal variant differences by sex.
2. New LBBB may obscure ST elevation, but its presence in the appropriate clinical context can imply transmural ischemia.
3. In these settings, ECG interpretation requires greater clinical correlation.
4. RBBB does not distort ST segments the way LBBB does, allowing for more reliable interpretation.
5. These findings reflect a posterior wall infarction and may benefit from posterior lead placement (V7-V9) to aid diagnosis.
6. These dynamic patterns require repeat ECGs for progression to STEMI; they represent early high-risk findings.
7. These ECG changes plus positional or pleuritic chest pain support a diagnosis of pericarditis.
8. Overlapping ECG and biomarker changes can complicate diagnosis in inflammatory conditions.
9. Prompt identification is critical as aortic dissection is a surgical emergency.
10. Electrolyte abnormalities should be considered in differential diagnoses of ST elevations.

    Top panel: Note ST-segment depression greater than 2 mm in the anterior leads (V1-V4) with accompanying tall R waves. Although associated diagnostic ST-segment elevation often is seen in the inferior or lateral leads and ST-segment elevation may be present in modified posterior leads V7 through V9, isolated true posterior MI may require urgent angiography for diagnosis.<br>

    Top panel: Tall, symmetric T waves are evident in the anterior precordial leads (V1-V4) arising from up-sloping segment depression greater than 1 mm at the J point. Although ST-segment elevation is notably absent in these leads, 1-mm ST-segment elevation is present in lead aVR.<br>
    Middle panel: Typical ST-segment elevation concerning for anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction may be seen in previous or subsequent ECGs, as seen in this repeat ECG performed 30 minutes later.<br>
    Bottom panel: Subsequent ECG demonstrates resolution of previous ST abnormalities after percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement to the occluded proximal left anterior descending artery.
