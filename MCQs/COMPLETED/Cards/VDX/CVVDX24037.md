### 🫠 Cardiovascular Infections: Cardiac Device Infection

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections** can present as **pocket infections**, **endocarditis**, or both.
2. Most **CIED infections** are caused by **Staphylococcus epidermidis** and **Staphylococcus aureus**.
3. Symptoms of **CIED infection** may include **fever**, **chills**, **malaise**, **lassitude**, and **failure to thrive**.
4. **CIED infections** often have an **insidious onset and presentation**.
5. Physical examination findings of **CIED pocket infection** may include **erythema**, **swelling**, **drainage**, **wound dehiscence**, or **device erosion**.
6. **Up to 5%** of patients with a **CIED** will develop an infection within **3 years** of implantation.
7. **CIED infections** may involve the **generator pocket**, the **leads**, or the **entire device**.
8. Diagnosis of **CIED infection** requires a **high index of suspicion** due to potentially **subtle presentation**.
9. Patients with suspected **CIED infection** should undergo **urgent specialist evaluation**, **blood culture testing**, and **echocardiography**.
10. **Empiric antibiotics** should not be initiated **before obtaining blood cultures** because they may obscure the diagnosis.
11. **Diagnostic aspiration** of the CIED pocket is **contraindicated** due to the risk of introducing infection.
12. Effective treatment of **CIED infection** includes **complete device removal**, **pocket debridement**, **sustained antibiotic therapy**, and **reimplantation at a new site** after infection clearance.
13. Patients with **pocket-only CIED infections** typically have **negative blood cultures** and **no echocardiographic evidence** of lead or valve vegetation.
14. Management of **pocket-only CIED infections** includes **removal of the entire device** and **2 weeks of antibiotics**.
15. Patients with **more extensive CIED infections** require **4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics** and **device removal** if they meet any of the following criteria:
    - Positive blood cultures for organisms likely to cause endocarditis (e.g., **Staphylococcus aureus**, **coagulase-negative staphylococci**, **Cutibacterium**, **Candida**, **non–group A streptococci**, or **enterococci**)
    - Positive blood cultures with **no alternative source**
    - **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** evidence of **lead wire or valve vegetation**

#### 💬 Extra
1. Pocket infections may be localized, but deeper infections involve leads and valves.
2. These are the most common organisms due to their skin flora origin and biofilm formation.
3. These symptoms can mimic nonspecific systemic illness.
4. Symptoms may be subtle, delaying diagnosis unless device issues are seen.
5. Erosion or discharge overlying the device pocket should prompt immediate concern for infection.
6. The risk increases with time and repeated procedures.
7. Complete hardware involvement complicates treatment and mandates full removal.
8. A subtle clinical course necessitates proactive diagnostic strategies.
9. Timely diagnosis helps prevent progression to systemic infection.
10. Cultures guide antibiotic choice and should be obtained before empiric therapy.
11. Aspiration can turn a sterile pocket into an infected one.
12. Reimplantation should occur only after the infection is fully eradicated.
13. TEE is used to assess for systemic spread in the setting of bacteremia.
14. Localized infections are treated with shorter antibiotic courses than systemic ones.
15. These findings indicate systemic involvement and necessitate prolonged treatment.
