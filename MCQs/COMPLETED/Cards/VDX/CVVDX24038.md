### 🫀 Cardiac Electrophysiology: Mobitz Type 2 Atrioventricular Block

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block** is characterized by regularly occurring **nonconducted P waves**.
2. In **Mobitz type 2 AV block**, the **PR intervals for conducted beats remain constant**.
3. **Mobitz type 1 AV block** is distinguished by **progressively lengthening PR intervals** before a nonconducted P wave.
4. **Complete (third-degree) AV block** is defined by the **absence of any P wave conduction to the ventricles**, unlike Mobitz type 2, which retains intermittent conduction.
5. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically represents **infra-Hisian conduction system disease**.
6. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** is less benign than Mobitz type 1 AV block, which usually occurs at the **AV nodal level**.
7. **High-grade AV block** is defined as the **absence of conduction of more than one successive P wave**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. In the referenced ECG, two nonconducted P waves are seen after the third QRS complex on the rhythm strip.
2. Constant PR intervals help distinguish Mobitz type 2 from Mobitz type 1.
3. The progressive PR lengthening in Mobitz type 1 distinguishes it from type 2.
4. Mobitz type 2 is not classified as complete heart block because some P waves still conduct.
5. Infra-Hisian disease suggests conduction delay or block below the bundle of His.
6. Mobitz type 1 is generally more benign because it occurs within the AV node.
7. This ECG demonstrates high-grade AV block in addition to Mobitz type 2 features.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **First-degree AV block** is defined by a **PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds** and is typically asymptomatic.
2. First-degree AV block is associated with an **increased risk of atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality**.
3. **Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) second-degree AV block** is characterized by **progressive prolongation of the PR interval** until a **nonconducted P wave** results in a **dropped QRS complex**.
4. **Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block** is characterized by **intermittent nonconducted P waves with a fixed PR interval**.
5. **2:1 AV block** cannot reliably distinguish between Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2.
6. **Mobitz type 2 AV block** typically occurs **below the AV node** and carries a **higher risk of progression to complete heart block**.
7. **High-degree AV block** refers to more than one consecutive nonconducted P wave, with **several P waves not followed by QRS complexes**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A PR interval >200 ms signifies delayed AV conduction but does not affect all ventricular depolarizations.
2. Longitudinal studies support increased morbidity despite lack of immediate symptoms in first-degree AV block.
3. Grouped beating is a key visual feature of Mobitz type 1 on ECG.
4. Mobitz type 2 may appear similar to 2:1 block but has fixed PR intervals and sudden dropped beats.
5. In 2:1 block, every other P wave fails to conduct, making classification difficult without additional evidence.
6. Mobitz type 2 often originates in or below the His-Purkinje system and warrants close monitoring or pacemaker evaluation.
7. High-degree block is often a prelude to third-degree block and represents advanced conduction disease.

    ECG showing Mobitz type 1 second-degree atrioventricular (Wenckebach) block, which manifests as a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until there is a dropped ventricular beat (arrow).

<!-- ECG Showing Mobitz Type 2 Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block -->

       alt="ECG tracing of Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block with intermittent blocked P waves and fixed PR interval">
  <figcaption>
    P waves are blocked intermittently (arrows), and the PR interval is fixed. Although 2 : 1 block can be a manifestation of Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block, note the wide QRS complexes, which are more consistent with block below the compact atrioventricular node.

  <figcaption>
    The rhythm strip shows constant PR interval (brackets) with intermittent dropped beats and nonconducted P waves (arrows). These findings are consistent with Mobitz type 2 second-degree heart block.

       alt="ECG tracing demonstrating complete heart block with AV dissociation between P waves and QRS complexes">
  <figcaption>
    In this ECG, the P waves (short arrows) and the QRS complexes (long arrows) are not associated with each other, indicating the presence of complete heart block.

<!-- ECG Demonstrating Substantial Conduction System Disease at High Risk of Progression -->
<figure>
  <img src="ECG Showing High-Risk Conduction System Disease.jpg"
       alt="ECG tracing showing right bundle‑branch block, borderline PR interval, and possible left posterior fascicular block, suggesting widespread conduction system disease">
  <figcaption>
    The tracing shows right bundle branch block with evidence of disease elsewhere in the conduction system, including borderline PR interval and possibly left posterior fascicular block. The latter findings indicate disease in the left bundle branch system also (and possibly the His bundle). In summary, this patient’s atrioventricular conduction is “hanging by a thread.”
