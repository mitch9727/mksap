### 🫠 Cardiovascular Imaging: Type B Aortic Dissection

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Type B aortic dissection** involves the **descending thoracic aorta** and spares the **ascending aorta**.
2. On **computed tomography (CT)** imaging, a dissection flap may separate a **true lumen** and a **false lumen** in the descending aorta.
3. In a **type B aortic dissection**, the **ascending aorta** appears normal in caliber and without dissection.
4. In **aortic intramural hematoma**, a **crescent-shaped collection of blood** forms within the **media** without **intimal disruption**.
5. A **penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer** results in blood localized at the site of the ulcer, contained within the **intima-medial layer**, forming a **pseudoaneurysm**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This type of dissection typically originates distal to the left subclavian artery and is managed medically unless complications arise.
2. Equal contrast enhancement on both sides of the dissection plane suggests **patent flow** in both lumens.
4. Aortic intramural hematomas may evolve into frank dissections or resolve with medical therapy.
5. Penetrating ulcers are associated with advanced atherosclerosis and can lead to rupture or dissection.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute aortic dissection** typically presents with **sudden, severe chest or back pain** that has a **tearing or ripping quality**.
2. Other presenting signs of **acute aortic dissection** may include **syncope**, **stroke**, **hypertension**, **aortic regurgitation murmur**, and **heart failure**.
3. **Asymmetric blood pressures**, **asymmetric pulses**, or **pulsus paradoxus** are physical exam findings that should raise suspicion for **aortic dissection**.
4. **Widened mediastinum on chest radiography** and **ST-segment depression on electrocardiography (ECG)** may be seen in **acute aortic syndromes**, but are **not diagnostic**.
5. In patients with **high suspicion for aortic dissection**, **immediate imaging** should be performed.
6. **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)** is the preferred imaging modality for **acute thoracic aortic disease** due to **speed**, **availability**, and **procedural planning utility**.
7. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is portable, avoids **iodinated contrast**, and provides detailed imaging of **aortic valve structure and function**.
8. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is limited in evaluating the **distal ascending aorta**, **transverse arch**, and **descending aorta**.
9. **Invasive aortography** is rarely used for diagnosis but may be performed during **endovascular repair** or when **noninvasive testing is contraindicated**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The characteristic pain of dissection can radiate to the back or abdomen depending on the location.
3. These physical findings reflect compromised blood flow to one or more vascular territories.
5. Prompt diagnosis is crucial due to the life-threatening nature of acute aortic syndromes.
7. TEE is especially useful in **unstable patients** or those with **contraindications to contrast**.
9. Aortography provides high-resolution imaging but is invasive and generally reserved for interventional planning.
