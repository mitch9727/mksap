### 🫠 Valvular Heart Disease: Bicuspid Aortic Valve

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bicuspid aortic valve disease** affects approximately **1% to 2% of the general population**.
2. **Bicuspid valve morphology** leads to **abnormal shear forces** that predispose to **early valve degeneration**.
3. **Aortic stenosis** occurs in **up to 75%** of patients with **bicuspid aortic valve**.
4. **Pure aortic regurgitation** occurs in approximately **2% to 10%** of patients with **bicuspid aortic valve**.
5. **Bicuspid aortic valve** commonly presents with an **incidental systolic ejection murmur** in adolescence or young adulthood.
6. Disease progression in **bicuspid aortic valve** may lead to **severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation** by the **fifth or sixth decade** of life.
7. **Bicuspid aortic valve** is often accompanied by **aortic arch abnormalities**, including **aneurysm**, **dissection**, or **coarctation**, **independent of valve severity**.
8. **Echocardiography** of a bicuspid aortic valve may demonstrate **fusion of the raphe between left and right cusps**, with visualization of **two cusps instead of three**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Bicuspid aortic valve is a common congenital condition, frequently undiagnosed until adulthood.
2. Abnormal flow dynamics cause accelerated wear and tear on the valve.
3. Stenosis is the predominant valvular lesion in bicuspid morphology.
4. Regurgitation may be isolated or occur alongside stenosis.
5. Murmurs in young patients are often the first clue to valvular pathology.
6. Long-term follow-up is necessary due to progressive degeneration.
7. Aortopathy is a recognized complication, necessitating imaging of the ascending aorta and arch.
8. Identification of fused cusps confirms the congenital nature of the valve abnormality.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **More than one third** of patients **older than 70 years** with **severe aortic stenosis** have an **underlying bicuspid aortic valve**.
2. The **ascending aorta and aortic arch** should be examined in all patients with **bicuspid aortic valve**, regardless of the **severity of valve disease**.
3. When **transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is suboptimal, **cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** or **computed tomography (CT) angiography** should be used for further imaging.
4. If **aortic abnormalities** are detected, **lifelong serial imaging** is indicated, with modality and frequency based on **severity, patient age, family history, and surgical candidacy**.
5. **Bicuspid aortic valve** is a **heritable condition**, and **first-degree relatives** may be considered for **screening with echocardiography**.
6. **Management** of bicuspid aortic valve disease depends on the **predominant lesion type** (stenosis or regurgitation) and its **severity**.
7. **Surgical repair of the ascending aorta** is reasonable in bicuspid valve patients undergoing valve surgery if the **aortic diameter is ≥4.5 cm**.
8. In the **absence of surgical indications for valve disease**, surgical repair of the aorta is **recommended** when the **diameter >5.5 cm**, and may be **reasonable when >5.0 cm** with **additional risk factors**.
9. There are **no medical therapies** proven to slow **aortic dilation** in bicuspid aortopathy.
10. **Blood pressure should be controlled** in bicuspid aortic valve patients with **hypertension**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The prevalence of bicuspid valve increases as a contributor to aortic stenosis in older adults.
2. Structural aortopathy is a known risk even when valve function is preserved.
3. Cross-sectional imaging provides higher spatial resolution in unclear cases.
4. Imaging strategy must consider dissection risk and the potential need for future interventions.
5. Familial clustering supports screening of asymptomatic relatives.
6. Decision-making includes whether stenosis or regurgitation predominates and how severe each is.
7. Aortic size ≥4.5 cm during valve surgery prompts consideration of simultaneous aortic intervention.
8. Additional dissection risk factors include family history and rapid growth (>0.5 cm/year).
9. Unlike in Marfan syndrome, no pharmacologic agents prevent aortic dilation here.
10. Controlling hypertension may help mitigate risk even without reversing dilation.
