### 🫀 Pericardial Disease: Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A large, circumferential **pericardial effusion** appears as an **anechoic space surrounding the entire heart** on ultrasonography.
2. **Collapse of the right atrium or right ventricle during diastole** is a sonographic finding suggestive of **cardiac tamponade**.
3. In cardiac tamponade, the **right ventricular free wall may exhibit inward diastolic motion**, sometimes described as “wiggling.”
4. **Pericardial effusions** are often **asymptomatic** and may be discovered incidentally on **chest radiograph**, **computed tomography (CT)**, or **echocardiogram**.
5. Most **asymptomatic pericardial effusions** are **idiopathic**, but **malignancy**, **infection**, **autoimmune disease**, **hypothyroidism**, and **iatrogenic causes** (e.g., medications, anticoagulation) should be considered.
6. In countries where **tuberculosis** is endemic, **more than 60% of pericardial effusions** are caused by tuberculosis.
7. **Pericardiocentesis** should be considered for **diagnostic and therapeutic purposes** if **cancer**, **tuberculosis**, or **bacterial infection** is strongly suspected.
8. Empiric **pericarditis treatment** may be reasonable in patients with **pericardial effusion of unknown cause and elevated inflammatory markers**.
9. **Drainage** should be considered for **large idiopathic effusions lasting more than 3 months**, due to a **one in three risk of progression to cardiac tamponade**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. On point-of-care ultrasound, this anechoic space is seen between the liver and the myocardium in subxiphoid view.
2. Right-sided chamber collapse during diastole reflects elevated pericardial pressure exceeding intracardiac pressure.
3. The “wiggling” appearance reflects diastolic right ventricular wall motion due to tamponade physiology.
4. Imaging is often the first clue in otherwise asymptomatic individuals.
5. Iatrogenic causes include procedures, drugs, and anticoagulation.
6. Tuberculosis remains a major cause in endemic areas and must be considered in global differential diagnosis.
7. Early intervention prevents hemodynamic compromise and allows fluid analysis.
8. This approach may avoid unnecessary drainage in inflammatory effusions.
9. Surveillance of large effusions is essential due to significant tamponade risk.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pericardial effusions** in **asymptomatic patients** are most often **idiopathic**.
2. **Malignancy**, **infection**, **autoimmune disease**, **hypothyroidism**, and **iatrogenic causes** such as **medications** and **anticoagulation therapy** are important causes of pericardial effusion.
3. In **tuberculosis-endemic countries**, **more than 60%** of pericardial effusions are due to **tuberculosis**.
4. **Pericardiocentesis** is indicated when there is strong suspicion for **cancer**, **tuberculosis**, or **bacterial infection**.
5. In patients with **pericardial effusion of unknown cause and elevated inflammatory markers**, **empiric treatment of pericarditis** may be reasonable.
6. **Large idiopathic pericardial effusions** lasting **more than 3 months** warrant **drainage**, as **one in three patients** may progress to **cardiac tamponade**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This refers to pericardial effusions detected incidentally in patients without symptoms.
2. These causes should be evaluated particularly when effusions are moderate to large or recurrent.
3. Regional epidemiology is key in determining the differential diagnosis.
4. Fluid analysis obtained via pericardiocentesis can help determine infectious or malignant etiology.
5. Elevated markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate may guide empiric therapy.
6. Prolonged observation without intervention risks hemodynamic compromise in a subset of patients.
