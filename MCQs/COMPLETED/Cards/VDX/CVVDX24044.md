### 🫠 Heart Failure: Left Ventricular Dysfunction on Point-of-Care Ultrasound

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** is suggested by a **dilated, rounded left ventricle** with **minimal systolic size reduction** on point-of-care ultrasound.
2. A **lack of interventricular septal thickening during systole** is a specific finding indicating **severely reduced left ventricular function**.
3. A **posterior wall that thickens normally during systole**, when the **interventricular septum does not**, supports the diagnosis of **systolic dysfunction**.
4. On parasternal long-axis view, a **diastolic mitral valve anterior leaflet-to-septum distance >1 cm** suggests **severe reduction in left ventricular function**.
5. The **absence of pericardial effusion** on ultrasound makes **cardiac tamponade** unlikely in the setting of hypotension or shock.
6. **Normal opening of the aortic and mitral valve leaflets** on ultrasound rules out **significant valvular stenosis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The parasternal long-axis view allows qualitative visual estimation of ejection fraction and gross chamber size.
2. Normal interventricular septal motion and thickening contribute to systolic function; their absence is pathologic.
4. The anterior mitral valve leaflet moves closer to the septum in early diastole; poor movement reflects poor LV filling and function.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial diagnostic testing for **heart failure** includes **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **chest radiography**, and **laboratory studies**.
2. An **ECG** may reveal evidence of **myocardial infarction**, **tachyarrhythmia**, or **left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)** in patients with suspected **heart failure**.
3. **Chest radiography** findings that support a diagnosis of **heart failure** include **cardiomegaly**, **vascular congestion**, **Kerley B lines**, and **pleural effusion**.
4. In patients with **dyspnea of unknown etiology**, **brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)** or **N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)** levels help distinguish **cardiac** from **pulmonary** causes.
5. **BNP levels >400 pg/mL (400 ng/L)** are suggestive of **heart failure**, while levels **<100 pg/mL (100 ng/L)** make heart failure unlikely.
6. **BNP levels between 100 and 400 pg/mL** are **not sensitive or specific** for diagnosing or excluding **heart failure**.
7. Elevated **BNP levels** may occur in **kidney disease**, **older age**, **sepsis**, **female sex**, and with use of **angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)**.
8. **Obesity** is associated with **lower BNP levels**, potentially confounding heart failure diagnosis.
9. For **NT-proBNP**, levels <300 pg/mL make **heart failure very unlikely**.
10. **Age-specific thresholds** for NT-proBNP indicating **high likelihood of heart failure** are: >450 pg/mL for age <50, >900 pg/mL for age 50–75, and >1800 pg/mL for age >75.
11. Laboratory evaluation of **heart failure** should include **complete blood count**, **electrolytes**, **kidney function**, **glucose**, **lipids**, **liver chemistries**, **iron studies**, and **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**.
12. **TSH testing** is used to identify **hypothyroidism** or **hyperthyroidism** as reversible causes of **heart failure**.
13. **Iron studies** are used to evaluate for **hemochromatosis** in patients with **heart failure**.
14. **Echocardiography** is the **primary diagnostic test** for evaluating **heart failure**, providing data on **chamber size**, **wall thickness**, **systolic and diastolic function**, and **valvular disease**.
15. **Regional wall motion abnormalities** on echocardiography suggest **coronary artery disease (CAD)** as a cause of **heart failure**.
16. **Left ventricular hypertrophy** on echocardiography may suggest **hypertension** or **cardiac amyloidosis**.
17. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging** is used to evaluate **myocarditis**, **infiltrative cardiomyopathies**, and **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** in the setting of **heart failure**.
18. **Routine CMR imaging** is **not recommended** unless **echocardiographic images are inadequate** or **a specific diagnosis is suspected**.
19. The diagnosis of **HFrEF**, **HFmrEF**, and **HFpEF** is based on **measured ejection fraction** and **evidence of increased left ventricular (LV) filling pressures**.
20. **Elevated LV filling pressures** may be identified by **high central venous pressure**, **elevated BNP/NT-proBNP**, **echocardiographic criteria**, or **invasive hemodynamic measurements**.

#### 💬 Extra
4. BNP and NT-proBNP are natriuretic peptides released in response to increased ventricular wall stretch and filling pressures.
7. ARNI therapy increases BNP levels by inhibiting neprilysin, which normally degrades BNP.
8. Adipose tissue clears natriuretic peptides more efficiently, contributing to low levels in obesity.
10. NT-proBNP thresholds reflect age-dependent baseline changes in natriuretic peptide metabolism.
14. Echocardiography is the most accessible and informative initial test in heart failure assessment.
17. CMR can help differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies based on tissue characterization.
19. Ejection fraction classification distinguishes systolic (HFrEF) from mid-range (HFmrEF) and preserved (HFpEF) heart failure subtypes.
