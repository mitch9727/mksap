### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Aortic Stenosis Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur** at the **right upper sternal border** that begins early in systole and extends to **S2** is characteristic of **aortic stenosis**.
2. **Aortic stenosis** often presents with a **delayed and diminished carotid pulse** (pulsus parvus et tardus).
3. The murmur of **aortic stenosis** begins **early in systole** and **extends nearly to the second heart sound (S2)**.
4. The murmur of **mitral regurgitation** is **holosystolic**, **high-pitched**, and **loudest at the apex**.
5. The murmur of **pulmonary stenosis** is best heard at the **left upper sternal border** and may increase in intensity with **inspiration**.
6. A **small ventricular septal defect** without pulmonary hypertension produces a **loud, palpable holosystolic murmur** at the **left sternal border** that may obliterate the **second heart sound (S2)**.
7. **Progressive pulmonary hypertension** shortens the duration of the **ventricular septal defect murmur**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This murmur’s location and timing help differentiate aortic stenosis from other systolic murmurs.
2. The delay in carotid upstroke reflects **reduced stroke volume** due to left ventricular outflow obstruction.
3. Timing and length of the murmur help differentiate it from other systolic murmurs.
4. The timing and location of this murmur help distinguish it from aortic stenosis.
5. Inspiratory augmentation of right-sided murmurs is due to increased venous return during inspiration.
6. The holosystolic nature and location distinguish this from other causes of systolic murmurs; palpable findings are often present.
7. Pulmonary hypertension affects flow dynamics and murmur duration.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The most common cause of **aortic stenosis** is **degenerative calcification of the aortic valve** associated with aging.
2. **Congenital bicuspid aortic valve**, **rheumatic heart disease**, and **chest irradiation** are additional causes of aortic stenosis.
3. **Severe aortic stenosis** causes **chronic left ventricular pressure overload**, leading to **concentric left ventricular hypertrophy** and **myocardial fibrosis**.
4. Common symptoms of **aortic stenosis** include **exertional dyspnea**, **syncope**, and **angina**, which typically appear only in **severe disease**.
5. Among **asymptomatic patients** with **severe aortic stenosis**, **75%** will develop symptoms or die within **5 years**.
6. Characteristic findings of **severe aortic stenosis** include a **late-peaking systolic murmur**, **diminished or absent aortic component of S2**, and **delayed carotid upstroke**.
7. The **loudness or harshness** of the murmur **does not correlate** with the severity of aortic stenosis.
8. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the primary imaging test for evaluating aortic stenosis severity, valve morphology, and left ventricular function.
9. **Severe aortic stenosis** is typically defined by a **valve area ≤1.0 cm²**, **peak velocity ≥4 m/s**, or **mean gradient ≥40 mm Hg**.
10. In **low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis** with **reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <50%)**, **dobutamine stress testing** is used to distinguish **true severe stenosis** from **pseudostenosis**.
11. In **paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis** (with preserved LVEF), low flow is due to **small left ventricular cavity size**, **high afterload**, or **atrial fibrillation**.
12. **Computed tomography (CT)** aortic valve **calcium scoring** may be useful in confirming severity in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis.
13. **Aortic valve replacement** improves **survival** in patients with **low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis**, regardless of ejection fraction.
14. The **aortic valve area** typically decreases by **approximately 0.12 cm² per year** in patients with aortic stenosis.
15. Patients with **severe aortic stenosis** should undergo **serial evaluation every 6 to 12 months**.
16. **Exercise stress testing** is **contraindicated** in patients with **symptomatic severe aortic stenosis**.
17. **Exercise stress testing** may be used in **asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis** to confirm symptom status, but only under **cardiologist supervision**.
18. In **pseudostenosis**, dobutamine increases cardiac output and valve opening, raising valve area into the **moderate range**.
19. In **true low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis**, valve area remains ≤1.0 cm² and gradient increases with stroke volume during dobutamine stress testing.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Degenerative calcific changes account for the majority of cases in patients ≥65 years.
2. Bicuspid valve stenosis often occurs earlier in life; rheumatic and radiation-induced causes may involve other valves.
3. Long-standing pressure overload leads to fibrosis, contributing to heart failure symptoms.
4. These symptoms are late manifestations and carry a poor prognosis once present.
5. This high event rate supports surveillance even in asymptomatic severe cases.
6. These findings reflect hemodynamic compromise and low cardiac output.
7. Murmur intensity can be misleading; valve area and gradients are more accurate measures.
8. TTE also evaluates for right-sided involvement and pulmonary hypertension.
9. These thresholds define hemodynamic severity and guide management decisions.
10. Pseudostenosis resolves with increased cardiac output; true stenosis does not.
11. These patients have preserved systolic function but still present with low transvalvular flow.
12. Calcium score helps confirm diagnosis when flow and gradient are incongruent with valve area.
13. Observational data support early valve replacement in these populations.
14. Rate of progression can vary with age, comorbidities, and baseline valve severity.
15. Serial imaging detects progression and helps time referral for intervention.
16. Risk of sudden decompensation makes stress testing unsafe in symptomatic cases.
17. Cardiologist supervision ensures safety and correct interpretation of findings.
18. Dobutamine reveals improved opening only in pseudostenosis due to increased driving pressure.
19. This pattern confirms truly severe obstruction despite low resting output.

    The carotid pulse amplitude is reduced. In the aortic area, S1 is normal and S2 is slightly diminished. There is a grade 2-3 midpeaking, systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur. The murmur does not extend to S2, indicating a moderate rather than severe aortic valvular obstruction.<br>
