### 🫀 Echocardiography: Normal Left Ventricular Function on Point-of-Care Ultrasound

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In a normal parasternal long-axis view on point-of-care ultrasonography, the **left ventricular wall thickness and chamber size appear normal and contract appropriately during systole**.
2. **Normal left ventricular systolic function** is indicated by **inward thickening and movement** of the **interventricular septum and posterior wall** during systole.
3. The **movement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve** and its **distance from the interventricular septum** during diastole is a rough gauge of left ventricular systolic function.
4. A **distance of less than 1.0 cm** between the anterior mitral leaflet and the interventricular septum in diastole is **generally considered normal**.
5. In point-of-care ultrasonography, this distance is often estimated visually using the **scale on the side of the screen** as a reference.
6. When the **anterior mitral leaflet contacts or slaps against the interventricular septum during diastole**, it suggests **normal left ventricular function**.
7. A combination of **normal chamber size**, **normal wall motion**, and **normal mitral valve movement** strongly supports **normal left ventricular function**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The image referenced is a parasternal long-axis view, which includes the left ventricle, left atrium, mitral valve, aortic valve, and interventricular septum.
2. Wall motion and thickening are key components of assessing systolic function using 2D echocardiography.
3. This mitral valve-septum distance is an indirect but practical tool in bedside ultrasound to estimate ejection fraction.
4. A <1.0 cm distance is derived from empirical observation and bedside echo heuristics.
5. The on-screen caliper scale can be used to visually estimate measurements when software tools are unavailable.
6. Contact between the anterior mitral valve leaflet and septum is commonly seen in normal or hyperdynamic function, as shown in the red-circled region of the image below.
7. These findings collectively reflect adequate left ventricular systolic performance without need for more advanced imaging modalities.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Diagnostic testing for structural heart disease should be considered in patients with a suggestive history and physical examination findings, such as **heart failure symptoms**, **grade 3/6 or louder systolic murmurs**, **diastolic or continuous murmurs**, or murmurs associated with **exertional dyspnea, light-headedness, or chest pain**.
2. Repeat cardiac imaging is indicated when there is a **change in clinical presentation**, **functional status**, or **examination findings** in patients with known structural heart disease.
3. In congenital and valvular disease, the **frequency of surveillance imaging** is guided by **lesion severity**.
4. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** is the **mainstay noninvasive imaging modality** for structural heart disease.
5. TTE evaluates **right and left ventricular chamber size**, **wall thickness**, **systolic function**, and **regional wall motion**.
6. TTE also provides information on **valvular pathology**, **diastolic function**, **hemodynamics**, and **pericardial effusion**.
7. **Intravenous agitated saline contrast** can be used with TTE to document the presence of an **intracardiac shunt**.
8. **Dobutamine stress echocardiography** can help distinguish **severe aortic stenosis** from **pseudo-severe aortic stenosis** in patients with **low-gradient AS and reduced ejection fraction**.
9. **Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)** can assess **gross cardiac function**, **chamber size**, **inferior vena cava size**, and **pericardial effusion**.
10. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is commonly used to evaluate **infective endocarditis** and its complications, such as **abscess**.
11. TEE is useful for assessing **valvular pathology** before surgical or percutaneous interventions.
12. TEE is preferred in patients with **implanted devices** or **inconclusive TTE**.
13. TEE can detect **acute aortic abnormalities** and is used to **rule out left atrial thrombus** before **cardioversion**.
14. **Contraindications to TEE** include **esophageal strictures** and **active esophageal varices**.
15. **Esophageal injury**, including **perforation and bleeding**, is a rare complication of TEE.
16. **Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)** imaging can evaluate **myocardial and pericardial disease**, especially **inflammatory and infiltrative cardiomyopathies**.
17. CMR is particularly useful for **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** with **eccentric or apical hypertrophy** not well seen on echocardiography.
18. CMR can serve as an **alternative to TEE** for assessing **valvular pathology** when **TTE is inadequate**.
19. TTE findings may raise suspicion for **cardiac amyloidosis**, but diagnosis requires **CMR or tissue biopsy**.
20. **99m-Technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) scintigraphy** can differentiate **transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis** from other amyloid types.
21. 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy has **>99% specificity** for **ATTR cardiac amyloidosis**.
22. **Focused cardiac imaging with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)** is commonly used in emergency medicine to assess **volume status via inferior vena cava size**.
23. **Intravenous agitated saline** is **normally cleared by the pulmonary circulation** unless there is a **right-to-left intracardiac shunt**.
24. **TEE probe placement** occurs in the **distal esophagus and stomach**, providing proximity to posterior cardiac structures.
25. **CMR imaging** enables **three-dimensional reconstruction of cardiac anatomy** using **non-ionizing techniques**.
26. **99m-Technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP)** scintigraphy allows **visual comparison of cardiac versus bone radiotracer uptake**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Murmurs with concerning characteristics or symptoms increase the pretest probability for structural abnormalities.
2. A clinical change warrants imaging to reassess anatomy and function.
3. This is aligned with adult congenital and valvular disease guidelines.
4. TTE is often the first-line diagnostic test for suspected structural heart disease.
5. Chamber dimensions and wall thickness are essential parameters in cardiomyopathy evaluation.
6. TTE assesses pericardial space for effusion and valvular leaflets for regurgitation or stenosis.
7. Agitated saline contrast reveals right-to-left shunts when bubbles bypass pulmonary filtration.
8. Dobutamine improves contractility, aiding in identifying flow-limiting stenosis under stress.
9. POCUS is a rapid bedside screening tool in emergency or critical care settings.
10. TEE is more sensitive than TTE for small vegetations and paravalvular abscesses.
11. TEE offers better resolution for surgical planning.
12. Acoustic shadowing from devices (e.g., prosthetic valves) limits TTE utility.
13. Visualization of LAA is critical before restoring sinus rhythm (see Figure 1).
14. Sedation and probe passage can worsen preexisting esophageal pathology.
15. Although rare, serious complications from TEE must be considered in risk-benefit analysis.
16. CMR can differentiate myocarditis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and pericardial constriction.
17. CMR offers superior apical resolution and detects variants not seen in standard echo windows.
18. CMR provides a noninvasive alternative when TEE is high risk or poorly tolerated.
19. Echocardiographic features of amyloidosis include thickened walls and granular appearance.
20. Differentiating AL from ATTR amyloidosis is critical because treatment strategies differ.
21. Bone tracer uptake by myocardium is characteristic of transthyretin amyloid infiltration (see Figure 2).
22. Inferior vena cava diameter collapsibility provides a bedside estimate of right atrial pressure or preload.
23. In a normal heart, microbubbles from agitated saline do not cross into the left heart due to pulmonary filtration.
24. This anatomic positioning allows TEE to image posterior valves (mitral, left atrial appendage) in high resolution.
25. This is valuable in structural heart disease where echocardiographic windows are limited or obstructed.
26. Cardiac uptake greater than bone uptake strongly supports transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis.
