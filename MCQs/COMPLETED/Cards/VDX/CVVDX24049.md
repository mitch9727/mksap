### 🫀 Valvular Heart Disease: Auscultatory Diagnosis of Mitral Stenosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Mitral stenosis** on cardiac auscultation produces a **diastolic opening snap** followed by a **long, low‑frequency diastolic rumbling murmur** best heard at the cardiac apex.  
2. The murmur of **mitral stenosis** has **mid‑diastolic and presystolic accentuation**, with the presystolic accentuation occurring immediately before a **loud first heart sound (S1)**.  
3. Optimal detection of the **mitral stenosis murmur** is achieved with the **bell of the stethoscope** placed at the apex while the patient lies in the **left lateral decubitus** position.  
4. **Aortic regurgitation** is characterized by a **high‑pitched early diastolic decrescendo murmur** best heard along the mid‑left sternal border.  
5. **Mitral regurgitation** produces a **high‑pitched holosystolic murmur** that is loudest at the apex.  
6. **Pulmonary regurgitation** produces an **early diastolic murmur** best heard over the **left second and third interspaces** that **increases with inspiration**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The opening snap results from sudden deceleration of thickened mitral valve leaflets after systolic opening, and the low‑frequency rumble reflects turbulent transmitral flow.  
2. Presystolic accentuation disappears in **atrial fibrillation** because atrial contraction is absent.  
3. Left lateral positioning brings the left ventricle closer to the chest wall, and the bell accentuates low‑frequency sounds below 100 Hz.  
4. The murmur of aortic regurgitation is best heard with the diaphragm and is accentuated by leaning forward at end‑expiration.  
5. The murmur of mitral regurgitation often radiates to the axilla and increases with hand‑grip maneuver due to augmented afterload.  
6. Inspiration increases right‑sided heart murmurs, such as that of pulmonary regurgitation, by enhancing venous return to the right heart.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Rheumatic heart disease** is the leading cause of **mitral stenosis** and occurs four times more often in women than in men.  
2. Rheumatic **mitral stenosis** results from **fusion of the mitral commissures** and can progress to **leaflet calcification** and **subvalvular apparatus thickening**.  
3. Additional causes of **mitral stenosis** include **parachute mitral valve**, **previous chest irradiation**, and **severe mitral annular calcification**.  
4. **Severe mitral stenosis** is defined by a **mitral valve area ≤1.5 cm²**, which typically corresponds to a **mean diastolic transmitral gradient >5–10 mm Hg** at a normal heart rate.  
5. Symptoms of **mitral stenosis** develop from **low cardiac output, pulmonary congestion, and pulmonary hypertension**, leading to fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and right‑sided heart failure.  
6. **Pregnancy** can precipitate or worsen symptoms of **mitral stenosis** because increased blood volume and cardiac output elevate the transmitral pressure gradient.  
7. **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** accurately assesses mitral stenosis severity, pulmonary artery pressures, and right ventricular function.  
8. **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)** is performed when TTE images are suboptimal and for pre‑intervention assessment in **mitral stenosis**.
9. In asymptomatic **mild aortic stenosis**—defined by a maximum aortic jet velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) of 2.0–2.9 m/s or a mean gradient <20 mm Hg—guidelines recommend yearly clinical evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography every 3–5 years.  
10. Asymptomatic **moderate aortic stenosis** (V<sub>max</sub> 3.0–3.9 m/s or mean gradient 20–39 mm Hg) should be followed with yearly clinical assessment and echocardiography every 1–2 years.  
11. Patients with asymptomatic **severe or very severe aortic stenosis** (V<sub>max</sub> ≥4 m/s or mean gradient ≥40 mm Hg or aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm²) require yearly clinical review and echocardiography every 6–12 months.  
12. For asymptomatic **mild aortic regurgitation**—vena contracta width <0.3 cm, effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) <0.10 cm², regurgitant volume <30 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction <30%—echocardiography is repeated every 3–5 years with annual clinical evaluation.  
13. Asymptomatic **severe aortic regurgitation** (vena contracta >0.6 cm, ERO ≥0.30 cm², regurgitant volume ≥60 mL/beat, regurgitant fraction ≥50%) should have clinical and echocardiographic follow‑up every 6–12 months, with more frequent imaging if the left ventricle is dilating.  
14. Asymptomatic **mild‑to‑moderate mitral stenosis** (mitral valve area >1.5 cm², diastolic pressure half‑time <150 ms) is monitored with echocardiography every 3–5 years and yearly clinical visits.  
15. In asymptomatic **severe mitral stenosis**—mitral valve area 1.0–1.5 cm², diastolic pressure half‑time ≥150 ms, or pulmonary artery systolic pressure >50 mm Hg—echocardiography is advised every 1–2 years, or annually if the valve area is <1.0 cm², together with yearly clinical assessment.  
16. Asymptomatic **moderate mitral regurgitation** (vena contracta <0.7 cm, ERO 0.20–0.39 cm², regurgitant volume 30–59 mL/beat) warrants echocardiography every 1–2 years and annual clinical review.  
17. A **holosystolic murmur** that intensifies with inspiration and is accompanied by prominent c and v waves in the jugular venous pulse is characteristic of **tricuspid regurgitation**.  
18. In **hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy**, a crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border becomes louder during the Valsalva maneuver or when the patient moves from squatting to standing.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Limited access to timely treatment of **streptococcal pharyngitis** increases the prevalence of rheumatic fever and subsequent valvular disease.  
2. Commissural fusion restricts leaflet excursion, whereas calcification and subvalvular fibrosis further narrow the valve orifice.  
3. **Mitral annular calcification–associated stenosis** is more common in older adults and is linked to peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and systemic inflammatory disorders.  
4. Tachycardia shortens diastole; therefore, for a given valve area, higher heart rates raise the transmitral gradient.  
5. Exercise increases transvalvular flow and left atrial pressure, exacerbating pulmonary congestion and dyspnea.  
6. Symptom onset during pregnancy most commonly occurs in the second trimester, when plasma volume peaks.  
7. Additional imaging or cardiac catheterization is rarely required when high‑quality TTE provides adequate assessment.  
8. TEE delineates mitral valve anatomy to determine suitability for **percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy** or surgical repair.
9. **V<sub>max</sub>** is measured with continuous‑wave Doppler across the aortic valve and reflects the peak velocity of blood flow.  
10. Serial imaging in valvular disease detects changes in transvalvular gradient, ventricular size, or ventricular function that may prompt earlier intervention.  
11. **Vena contracta** is the narrowest portion of a regurgitant jet measured on color Doppler imaging; it provides a qualitative estimate of regurgitation severity.  
12. **Regurgitant fraction** equals regurgitant volume divided by stroke volume and quantifies the percentage of blood leaking backward each beat.  
13. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is estimated on echocardiography from the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet using the modified Bernoulli equation.  
14. The **Rivero‑Carvallo sign** describes augmentation of right‑sided murmurs, such as that of tricuspid regurgitation, during inspiration.  
15. Maneuvers that reduce left ventricular preload (e.g., the Valsalva strain) accentuate dynamic outflow obstruction and therefore the murmur of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
