### 🫠 Heart Sounds: Identification of the Third Heart Sound (S3)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **third heart sound (S3)** is a **low-frequency**, **early diastolic** sound best heard with the **bell of the stethoscope** at the **cardiac apex**.
2. An **S3** may be perceived as a **double S2** and is best heard when the patient is in the **left lateral decubitus position**.
3. The **S3 heart sound** is often heard in **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
4. The **S3 sound** may also be present in **volume overload states**, such as **valvular regurgitation**, **shunt lesions**, or **late pregnancy**.
5. An **S3** can be a **normal finding** in **children** or **highly trained athletes**.
6. A **split second heart sound (S2)** consists of **high-frequency** components best heard with the **diaphragm** in the **second left intercostal space**.
7. **Physiologic splitting of S2** varies with the **respiratory cycle**, being heard as a **single S2** during expiration and a **double S2** during inspiration.
8. **Paradoxical splitting of S2** occurs when the split is heard during **expiration** and a **single S2** during **inspiration**, commonly seen in **aortic stenosis**, **left bundle branch block**, and **right ventricular pacing**.
9. The **fourth heart sound (S4)** is a **low-frequency** sound that occurs in **late diastole** and may be perceived as a **double S1**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The S3 occurs due to rapid ventricular filling and is a marker of increased filling pressures.
4. These conditions create increased preload or altered compliance, leading to a more pronounced S3.
6. In contrast to S3, the split S2 components represent asynchronous closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves.
8. Paradoxical splitting indicates delayed closure of the aortic valve relative to the pulmonic valve.
9. The S4 is associated with atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **third heart sound (S3)** is a supportive physical examination finding in patients with **volume overload** in **heart failure**.
2. **Volume overload in heart failure** may present with **weight gain**, **dyspnea**, **orthopnea**, **paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**, and **bendopnea**.
3. **Bendopnea** is associated with **elevated filling pressures**, particularly in the setting of a **reduced cardiac index**.
4. Supportive examination findings for **volume overload** include **elevated central venous pressure**, **pulmonary crackles**, **S3**, **ascites**, and **edema**.
5. **Low cardiac output** in heart failure is indicated by **hypotension**, **low pulse pressure**, **cool extremities**, and **reduced cognition**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. An S3 in this setting suggests elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
2. These symptoms reflect pulmonary congestion and redistribution of intravascular volume.
3. Bendopnea is a specific finding indicating advanced hemodynamic impairment.
4. These signs help differentiate between fluid overload and other causes of dyspnea or edema.
5. Low output states can occur even in the absence of overt fluid overload and should prompt evaluation of perfusion.
