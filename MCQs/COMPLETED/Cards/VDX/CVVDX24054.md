### 🫀 Arrhythmia: Bigeminal Premature Ventricular Contractions

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)** that occur in a **bigeminal pattern** can cause symptoms because every alternate ventricular beat is non-perfusing.  
2. In bigeminal PVCs, only the intervening **narrow QRS sinus complexes** generate effective cardiac output, so the **palpated pulse rate** is roughly half of the electrical ventricular rate.  
3. A **pulse rate of about 38 beats per minute** during bigeminal PVCs represents **physiologic bradycardia** perceived by the patient, not true electrical bradycardia.  
4. The ECG features diagnostic of **Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome** (short PR interval and delta wave) are **absent** when the rhythm disturbance is isolated bigeminal PVCs.  
5. **Long QT syndrome** and **WPW syndrome** usually present with **palpitations** and **syncope**, whereas bigeminal PVCs more often present with symptoms of a slow effective pulse.  

#### 💬 Extra  
1. Bigeminy is a repeating sequence of one normal (sinus) beat followed by one PVC.  
2. Because PVCs do not create a palpable pulse, the electrical ventricular rate in bigeminy may be nearly double the pulse rate.  
3. Fatigue, light-headedness, or dizziness arise from the reduced effective heart rate and stroke volume.  
4. Frequent ventricular ectopy can make accurate QT-interval measurement unreliable.  
5. Recognizing the typical presentations of WPW and congenital long QT syndrome helps avoid unnecessary testing for those conditions.

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. **Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)** occur in **up to 75%** of otherwise healthy adults.  
2. The most common **symptoms of PVCs** are **palpitations** or the sensation of **skipped beats**.  
3. The post-PVC beat feels **forceful** because ventricular filling increases during the compensatory pause that follows the PVC.  
4. PVCs are more frequent in patients with **hypertension**, **left ventricular hypertrophy**, prior **myocardial infarction**, or other **structural heart disease** such as **non-ischemic cardiomyopathy**.  
5. When **high-risk features** (syncope, family history of premature sudden cardiac death, structural heart disease) are absent, **reassurance** without pharmacologic therapy is usually appropriate.  
6. **Treatment is recommended** when PVCs are **bothersome** or **frequent**, defined as **>10 % of all heartbeats** or **>10 000 PVCs per day**.  
7. A sustained PVC burden of **>10 %–15 % of beats** can lead to **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy** in a minority of patients.  
8. **β-Blockers** or **calcium channel blockers** are the **first-line medications** for suppressing symptomatic or frequent PVCs.  
9. **β-Blockers** are preferred over calcium channel blockers in patients who have concomitant **ventricular systolic dysfunction**.  
10. If PVCs persist despite first-line agents, a **membrane-active antiarrhythmic drug** such as **flecainide** may be prescribed.  
11. **Catheter ablation** should be considered for patients who remain highly symptomatic, cannot tolerate medications, or develop **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy** despite optimal medical therapy.  

#### 💬 Extra  
1. Incidental, asymptomatic PVCs generally carry an excellent prognosis.  
2. Both the early PVC and the subsequent compensatory pause contribute to the feeling of an “extra” or “skipped” heartbeat.  
3. The longer diastolic interval after a PVC increases preload, augmenting the stroke volume of the ensuing sinus beat.  
4. Structural abnormalities create arrhythmogenic foci that increase PVC frequency.  
5. Presence of high-risk features warrants evaluation for latent cardiomyopathy or channelopathy.  
6. A daily burden of 10 000 PVCs corresponds to roughly 10 % of the average adult heartbeats over 24 hours.  
7. PVC-induced cardiomyopathy is usually reversible once the PVC burden is reduced through medication or ablation.  
8. The calcium channel blockers used for PVC suppression are the **non-dihydropyridine** agents **verapamil** or **diltiazem**.  
9. β-Blockers mitigate sympathetic stimulation, which can trigger ventricular ectopy, and improve ventricular remodeling in systolic dysfunction.  
10. Class IC agents like flecainide should be avoided in significant ischemic heart disease.  
11. Contemporary ablation techniques can eliminate the PVC focus with success rates exceeding 80 % in experienced centers.
