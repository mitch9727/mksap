### 🫠 Cardiology: Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia on ECG

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is the most likely diagnosis for a **wide-complex tachycardia** with QRS duration ≥120 ms and specific morphologic ECG features.
2. **Wide-complex tachycardia** is typically diagnosed as **VT** when there is positivity in **lead aVR**, **QRS concordance** in the precordial leads, **non–right or left bundle branch block morphology**, and **extreme axis deviation** ("northwest axis").
3. The **absence of syncope or loss of consciousness** does not exclude **VT** as a diagnosis.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The diagnosis of VT is based on morphology criteria observed on ECG, especially in the context of urgent care presentations.
2. A concordant QRS means all precordial leads show either entirely positive or entirely negative QRS complexes.
3. Clinical symptoms are not reliable alone to exclude ventricular arrhythmia, particularly in stable presentations.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** is a **monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia** (QRS ≥120 ms) that originates in the ventricles.
2. **VT** commonly occurs in patients with **structural heart disease**, including **ischemic** and **nonischemic cardiomyopathy**, due to abnormal conduction or myocardial scar tissue.
3. **Sustained VT** (≥30 seconds) may result in **hypotension**, **syncope**, **ventricular fibrillation (VF)**, or **cardiac arrest**.
4. The **absence of symptoms or hemodynamic instability** does not rule out **VT**.
5. **Idiopathic VT**, occurring in patients without structural heart disease, typically arises from the **ventricular outflow tracts**, **fascicles**, or **papillary muscles**.
6. **Idiopathic VT** usually presents with **palpitations** in patients aged 30 to 50 years, and **syncope is uncommon**.
7. **VT** should be distinguished from **SVT with aberrancy**, **antidromic AV reentrant tachycardia (preexcited SVT)**, and **ventricular paced rhythms**.
8. In adult patients with known **structural heart disease**, **95% of wide-complex tachycardias** are due to **VT**.
9. **Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation**, **fusion beats**, and **capture beats** on ECG are helpful in distinguishing **VT** from other wide-complex tachycardias.
10. If the origin of a wide-complex tachycardia is uncertain, **VT should be assumed** for the purposes of **arrhythmia therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Monomorphic VT has uniform QRS complexes and differs from polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes.
2. Myocardial scarring, such as from prior infarcts, creates a reentry substrate that predisposes to VT.
3. Therapy should not be delayed based on the presence or absence of symptoms when VT is suspected.
4. The outflow tract regions are frequent sites of idiopathic VT in structurally normal hearts.
5. Misclassification of wide-complex rhythms can lead to inappropriate treatment; hence assuming VT ensures safety.
9. These ECG findings are classical hallmarks of VT when structural heart disease is not present.
