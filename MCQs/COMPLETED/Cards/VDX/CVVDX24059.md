### 🫠 Cardiomyopathy: Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stress-induced cardiomyopathy** is also known as **takotsubo cardiomyopathy** or **apical ballooning syndrome**.
2. **ST-segment elevation** is the most common electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality in stress-induced cardiomyopathy, most frequently in the **anterior precordial leads**.
3. Other ECG changes in stress-induced cardiomyopathy may include **deep T-wave inversion**, **QT-interval prolongation**, **abnormal Q waves**, and **nonspecific abnormalities**.
4. **Stress-induced cardiomyopathy** can mimic **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**, with similar ECG changes and **elevated troponin levels**, although troponin elevation is typically lower.
5. **Urgent coronary angiography** is warranted in suspected stress-induced cardiomyopathy to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease.
6. A normal coronary angiogram in a patient with ECG changes and stressor-associated symptoms supports the diagnosis of **stress-induced cardiomyopathy**.
7. **Microvascular coronary artery disease** and **resolved STEMI** are unlikely to cause **persistent ECG changes** with a **normal coronary angiogram**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These terms are used interchangeably to describe the same reversible cardiac condition.
4. Despite mimicking STEMI, troponin levels in stress cardiomyopathy are often not as high.
6. Stressor-associated symptom onset (e.g., during emotional or physical stress) is a key historical clue.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Stress-induced cardiomyopathy** typically occurs in **older women** and is usually precipitated by a **stressful physical or emotional event**.
2. **Stress-induced cardiomyopathy** is associated with **reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)**, **elevated cardiac enzyme levels**, and **signs of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG)**.
3. **Apical dyskinesis or ballooning**, with preservation of **basal wall motion**, is the typical finding on **echocardiography** or **left ventriculography** in stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. The condition is hypothesized to result from **reversible myocardial toxicity** induced by **high catecholamine levels**.
5. Because stress-induced cardiomyopathy resembles **acute coronary syndrome**, **coronary angiography** is often performed.
6. Treatment of stress-induced cardiomyopathy is **largely supportive** and follows heart failure guidelines.
7. Most patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy recover **cardiac function** within **weeks to months**.
8. **Repeat echocardiography** should be performed in **3 to 6 months** to evaluate recovery of cardiac function.
9. It is unclear how long to continue **medical therapy** after cardiac function recovery, but most clinicians continue it for **at least 1 year**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Common triggers include emotional trauma, bereavement, or sudden surprise.
3. These wall motion abnormalities do not correspond to a single coronary artery territory.
4. The exact pathophysiology remains unknown, but catecholamine-induced toxicity is a leading theory.
9. Long-term therapy decisions are individualized and guided by clinician judgment.
