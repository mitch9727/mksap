### 🫠 Cardiac Rhythm Disorders: Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are early isolated beats that originate from the atria.
2. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are exceedingly common and increase in frequency with age.
3. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** can produce an **irregular pulse** by being either **conducted**, leading to an early pulse, or **blocked** in the atrioventricular node, resulting in **compensatory pauses**.
4. The presence of **discrete P waves** on electrocardiogram (ECG) excludes the diagnosis of **atrial fibrillation**.
5. The absence of **premature wide QRS complexes** on ECG excludes the diagnosis of **premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)**.
6. The presence of **premature P waves with morphology differing from sinus rhythm** excludes **sinus arrhythmia** as the cause of irregular pulse.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PACs are often benign but can trigger more significant arrhythmias in predisposed individuals.
3. Conducted PACs may produce palpitations, while blocked PACs can lead to pauses perceived as skipped beats.
4. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by absent P waves and an irregularly irregular rhythm.
5. PVCs typically appear as early, wide QRS complexes with discordant T waves.
6. Sinus arrhythmia involves gradual changes in P-P interval due to respiratory variation, not discrete ectopic P waves.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are early isolated atrial beats that occur frequently during ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.
2. Only **1% of individuals** have no **premature atrial contractions (PACs)** during ambulatory ECG monitoring.
3. **High burden of premature atrial contractions (PACs)** is associated with an increased risk of **atrial fibrillation (AF)**.
4. **Symptomatic premature atrial contractions (PACs)** are typically treated with **β-blockers** or **calcium channel blockers**.
5. **Atrial tachycardia** is a **supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)** characterized by a **rate greater than 100/min** and **origin from an atrial site other than the sinus node**.
6. **β-blockers** or **calcium channel blockers** are first-line therapy for **symptomatic atrial tachycardia**.
7. **Catheter ablation** or **antiarrhythmic drug therapy** is second-line treatment for **atrial tachycardia**.
8. **Ablation success rates** for **atrial tachycardia** are generally **lower** than for other **supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs)**.
9. **Multifocal atrial tachycardia** is defined by the presence of **three or more distinct P-wave morphologies** and a **heart rate greater than 100/min**.
10. **Multifocal atrial tachycardia** is most commonly seen in patients with **severe pulmonary disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PACs can be detected on Holter monitors even in asymptomatic individuals.
3. PAC burden contributes to atrial remodeling and is a known precursor to atrial fibrillation.
4. Both drug classes suppress ectopic atrial activity and help control symptoms.
5. Unlike sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia arises from ectopic foci.
7. These treatments are generally reserved for patients with refractory symptoms or structural heart disease.
8. This may be due to the diffuse or variable nature of atrial foci in atrial tachycardia.
9. The diagnosis requires at least three different P-wave morphologies in a single ECG tracing.
10. Chronic lung disease (e.g., COPD) alters atrial conduction and predisposes to this arrhythmia.
