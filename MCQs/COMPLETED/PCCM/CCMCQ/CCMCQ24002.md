### 🫀 Critical Care Medicine: Treatment of Exertional Heat Stroke

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Heat stroke** is defined by a core body temperature greater than 40.0 °C (104.0 °F) accompanied by **encephalopathy**.  
2. **Exertional heat stroke** can occur in young, otherwise healthy individuals, especially in high ambient temperatures combined with physical activity and high humidity.  
3. Risk factors for exertional heat stroke include **obesity**, **lack of adequate hydration**, and wearing **heavy clothes or equipment**.  
4. Initial efforts to lower core temperature in heat stroke should include **body exposure** and **evaporative cooling methods**, such as water mist, wet towels, and fans.  
5. Patients with severe exertional heat stroke require **ice water immersion** to rapidly reduce core temperature to below **39.0 °C (102.2 °F)**, preferably within 30 minutes.  
6. Immersion therapy for heat stroke carries a risk of **hypothermia** and requires careful monitoring.  
7. **Centrally acting antipyretics**, such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs, are ineffective in exertional heat stroke and are **not recommended**.  
8. **Dantrolene** is not a proven treatment for heat stroke; it is used in malignant hyperthermia.  
9. Hyponatremia may occur with exertion and heat stroke, but **3% sodium chloride solution** is only indicated for severe hyponatremia with neurologic symptoms.  
10. **Key Point:** Patients with heat stroke urgently need rapid and active cooling to avoid long-term sequelae.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Extraneurologic complications of heat stroke can include **kidney and liver injury**, **disseminated intravascular coagulation**, and **rhabdomyolysis**.  
2. Mortality from untreated heat stroke can be up to **60%**.  
5. Other cooling methods, such as **partial submersion in cold water**, **ice packs**, or **evaporative cooling**, may be effective depending on severity and availability.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Heat stroke occurs when the body's thermal regulatory system is overwhelmed by environmental heat load.  
2. Heat stroke is generally defined by a **core body temperature greater than 40.0 °C (104.0 °F)** and **encephalopathy**.  
3. For both exertional and nonexertional heat stroke, the priority is lowering the core temperature to **below 39.0 °C (102.2 °F)** as quickly as possible, preferably within **30 minutes**.  
4. The most effective cooling method is **submersion in ice water or cold water**, if feasible.  
5. Less severe cases of heat stroke may respond to **evaporative cooling measures** with or without **ice packs**.  
6. **Centrally acting antipyretics** such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs are not effective in the treatment of heat stroke.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Careful monitoring of **core body temperature** is required during immersion therapy because of the risk of hypothermia.
