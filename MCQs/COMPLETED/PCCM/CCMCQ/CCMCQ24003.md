### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Management of Severe Anaphylaxis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Anaphylactic shock** is triggered by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-linked immunologic responses to antigens with release of multiple cellular mediators into the circulation.
2. Anaphylaxis manifests as **hypotension, tachycardia, and airway compromise** with angioedema and bronchoconstriction.
3. Symptom onset in anaphylaxis may be immediate or delayed for hours or even days, with a rapid onset usually indicating a more severe reaction.
4. **Epinephrine** is first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and acts by causing vasoconstriction, respiratory smooth muscle relaxation, and stabilization of degranulating inflammatory cells.
5. Some patients experience **biphasic anaphylaxis**, with recurrence of symptoms within hours, requiring repeat doses of epinephrine or intravenous infusion if shock persists.
6. Risk factors for biphasic anaphylaxis include a **severe initial episode** and the **need for more than one dose of epinephrine**.
7. Initial treatment of anaphylaxis is with intramuscular epinephrine; the efficacy of **glucocorticoids** in the treatment of anaphylaxis has not been established, and their role in therapy is unclear.
8. Patients with severe anaphylaxis requiring multiple doses of epinephrine should undergo **continued observation** due to risk of recurrence.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
4. Epinephrine can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or as a continuous infusion, depending on the severity of the reaction and response.
7. Glucocorticoids have a delayed onset of action and cannot treat the acute symptoms of anaphylaxis.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. **Anaphylaxis** is usually triggered by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-linked responses to foods, medications, insect venom, latex, or other antigens but may occur without an allergic trigger.
2. Mediator release in anaphylaxis results in clinical manifestations such as **pruritus, hypotension, and angioedema** caused by capillary leak.
3. **Rapid symptom onset** usually signals a more severe anaphylactic reaction.
4. Massive capillary leak in anaphylaxis can result in **distributive shock** similar to septic shock.
5. **Angioedema** may be life-threatening when it compromises the airway.
6. Initial treatment of anaphylaxis is **isolation from triggers and epinephrine**, preferably intramuscular, with early administration being key.
7. Intramuscular **epinephrine autoinjectors** are available for patient use.
8. Antihistamines may relieve symptoms of **pruritus and rash** as adjunctive therapy in anaphylaxis.
9. Patients with anaphylaxis should receive **supplemental oxygen** and be monitored for airway compromise; intubation or cricothyrotomy may be required.
10. **Fluid resuscitation** and additional vasopressor therapy may be required for persistent shock despite epinephrine.
11. Factors that increase risk for biphasic anaphylaxis include severe initial episode and need for more than one dose of epinephrine.
12. Extended **observation of 6 hours or longer** may be warranted in high-risk patients.
13. Guidelines recommend measuring **baseline serum tryptase** in patients with recurrent, idiopathic, or severe anaphylaxis; Hymenoptera venom–associated anaphylaxis; or suspected mastocytosis.
14. Angioedema may occur without an allergic stimulus and can be **bradykinin mediated**, particularly with **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor** use.
15. Nonallergic angioedema has a slower onset than allergic angioedema and is not associated with urticaria, pruritus, or hypotension.
16. Hereditary angioedema is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of **C1 esterase inhibitor** and is treated with agents targeting the **C1 inhibitor–bradykinin pathway** or fresh frozen plasma if first-line therapies are unavailable.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
6. Intramuscular epinephrine is preferred to intravenous administration due to reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.
16. Patients diagnosed with hereditary angioedema should be provided with an **emergency care plan**.
