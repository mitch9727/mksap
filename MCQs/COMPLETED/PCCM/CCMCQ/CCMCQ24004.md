### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Fat embolism syndrome** is the entrance of fat globules into the systemic circulation, usually after long bone fracture, and is a rare but potentially fatal complication caused by systemic manifestations of fat emboli lodging in capillaries and arterioles.  
2. The **classic presentation** of fat embolism syndrome is the triad of respiratory insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, and petechial rash in the setting of recent orthopedic trauma.  
3. Fat embolism syndrome is a **clinical diagnosis**, and evaluation primarily centers on exclusion of other causes because no specific diagnostic tests are available.  
4. High-resolution CT scan findings in fat embolism syndrome are **nonspecific** and may include ground-glass opacities or nodular densities, but results may also be normal.  
5. The **key point** is that fat embolism syndrome presents with respiratory insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, and petechial rash after orthopedic trauma, and diagnosis is clinical with no specific test.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Fat embolism can be a relatively common event after trauma with long bone fracture, but only some patients develop systemic manifestations leading to fat embolism syndrome.  
4. High-resolution CT imaging is not diagnostic and cannot reliably confirm or exclude fat embolism syndrome.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Fat embolism is the entrance of fat globules into the systemic circulation and is relatively common after trauma involving long bone fractures.  
2. Fat embolism syndrome is a rare but potentially lethal complication resulting from systemic manifestations of fat emboli lodging in capillaries and arterioles.  
3. The diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome is clinical and is based on the triad of respiratory insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, and petechial rash occurring after a long bone fracture.  
4. Findings on high-resolution CT of the chest in fat embolism syndrome are nonspecific and may be normal.  
5. There is no definitive therapy for established fat embolism syndrome, and treatment is supportive.  
6. Most patients with fat embolism syndrome recover spontaneously and completely, although mortality can reach 5% to 20%.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Although fat embolism is common after long bone fractures, fat embolism syndrome occurs only in a subset of patients.  
5. Supportive management is the mainstay because no specific therapy has been proven effective.
