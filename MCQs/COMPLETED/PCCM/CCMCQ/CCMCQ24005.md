### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning** usually results from exposure to a **combustion source** in an **enclosed area**.
2. Symptoms of **mild to moderate CO poisoning** may include **confusion**, **headache**, **nausea**, **tachypnea**, **tachycardia**, and **mild serum lactate elevation**.
3. **Severe CO poisoning** can lead to **coma** and **anoxic brain injury**.
4. **Diagnosis of CO poisoning** requires both a **high index of suspicion** and demonstration of an **elevated carboxyhemoglobin level** on **blood gas analysis**.
5. **Pulse oximetry** is **not helpful** in CO poisoning because it does not differentiate between **oxyhemoglobin** and **carboxyhemoglobin**.
6. A **normal carboxyhemoglobin level** is less than **3%** in nonsmokers.
7. In **smokers**, carboxyhemoglobin levels may reach **10% to 15%**.
8. A **carboxyhemoglobin level >15%** is consistent with **CO poisoning**.
9. **Severe CO poisoning symptoms** usually occur at a carboxyhemoglobin level of **≥25%**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Mild symptoms such as headache and nausea overlap with many conditions, contributing to frequent misdiagnosis.
4. Confirmation by **blood gas with co-oximetry** is the diagnostic gold standard.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Carbon monoxide (CO)** is a **colorless, odorless product of hydrocarbon combustion** that binds avidly to hemoglobin, forming **carboxyhemoglobin** and causing **tissue hypoxia and ischemia**.
2. **CO toxicity** occurs almost exclusively in **enclosed combustion exposures** and may also occur in **suicide attempts**.
3. **Clinical manifestations** of CO poisoning include **headache**, **nausea**, **malaise**, **confusion**, **syncope**, or **seizures**; **tachypnea** and **tachycardia** are common.
4. **Pulse oximetry is not useful** in CO poisoning because it cannot distinguish **oxyhemoglobin** from **carboxyhemoglobin**.
5. **Blood gas analysis with CO oximetry** measures the **carboxyhemoglobin level**, which is normally **<3%**, or up to **10%–15% in smokers**.
6. A **mild serum lactate elevation** may be present in CO poisoning.
7. The **primary treatment** of CO poisoning is **supplemental oxygen**, which reduces carboxyhemoglobin half-life from **300 minutes (room air)** to **90 minutes (100% O₂)** to **30 minutes (hyperbaric O₂ at 2–3 atm)**.
8. Patients with **carboxyhemoglobin ≥25%** or **organ ischemia** should be treated with **hyperbaric oxygen** if available.
9. **Delayed neurologic sequelae** occur in ~40% of **severe CO poisoning** cases, presenting with **neurocognitive or personality changes** within **20 days to 1 year** of exposure.
10. **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy** may reduce the risk and severity of these delayed neurologic sequelae.

#### 💬 Extra
1. CO’s high affinity for hemoglobin (≈200–250× that of oxygen) explains its potent tissue hypoxia effect.
7. The therapeutic benefit of hyperbaric oxygen derives from both competitive binding and increased dissolved oxygen content in plasma.
9. Sequelae likely result from ischemic injury to oxygen-sensitive brain regions, though the exact mechanism is uncertain.
