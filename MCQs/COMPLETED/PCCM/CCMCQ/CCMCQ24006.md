### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Lithium Toxicity

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Lithium** is an effective treatment for **bipolar disorder** but has a **narrow therapeutic window**, and toxicity is common.
2. Risk factors for **lithium toxicity** include **increased age**, **hypovolemia**, and **kidney disease**.
3. Early symptoms of **lithium toxicity** are **gastrointestinal**, including **nausea**, **vomiting**, and **diarrhea**, which may be mistaken for gastrointestinal infection.
4. Later and more severe symptoms of **lithium toxicity** include **agitation**, **confusion**, **ataxia**, **tremor**, and **myoclonic jerks**.
5. **Arginine vasopressin resistance** (formerly called **nephrogenic diabetes insipidus**) is a common complication of **lithium toxicity** and results in **hypernatremia** and **volume depletion**.
6. The diagnosis of **lithium toxicity** is confirmed by an **elevated serum lithium level**.
7. Management of **lithium toxicity** includes **volume resuscitation** and **careful serum sodium management**.
8. **Hemodialysis** is indicated if the **serum lithium level is >4 mEq/L (4 mmol/L)** or if severe symptoms such as **seizure** or **coma** are present.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Gastrointestinal features may precede neurologic symptoms, leading to diagnostic delay.
5. Arginine vasopressin resistance from lithium can mimic diabetes insipidus and cause dehydration.
8. Indications for dialysis are based on both serum level and clinical severity.

#### ✅ True Statements — Overdose of Therapeutic Drugs
1. Patients may overdose on prescribed medications **inadvertently or intentionally**.
2. Ingestion of **multiple medications** is common in drug overdoses, as is **concomitant ethanol ingestion**.
3. Important factors in determining the nature of a drug overdose include **suicidal ideation or intent**, **medications prescribed to the patient and family members**, **which prescriptions were filled**, **events reported by the patient or bystanders**, and **clinical signs and symptoms**.
4. If patients are **alert and cooperative enough to protect their airway**, **activated charcoal** may be beneficial when administered **within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. A thorough history of prescriptions and collateral information is critical for overdose evaluation.
4. Airway protection is the limiting factor for activated charcoal use.
