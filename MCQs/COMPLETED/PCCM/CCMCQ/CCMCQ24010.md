### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of ICU-Acquired Weakness

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **ICU-acquired weakness** is prevalent in patients with critical illness and can occur within a week of ICU presentation.
2. Patients with ICU-acquired weakness present with diffuse, symmetric weakness in the extremities and respiratory muscles.
3. Reflexes in ICU-acquired weakness are usually preserved but may be impaired.
4. Evaluation for ICU-acquired weakness can initially be performed at the bedside using the Medical Research Council sum score, but this test requires patient participation.
5. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity testing is the gold standard for diagnosing ICU-acquired weakness.
6. ICU-acquired weakness is the most likely diagnosis in critically ill patients with diffuse weakness in the absence of trauma, autoimmune disease, or previous neurologic disease.
7. The classic triad of an epidural abscess is fever, back pain, and focal neurologic signs and symptoms.
8. Myasthenia gravis typically presents with extraocular and bulbar muscle weakness that worsens with activity.
9. Viral meningitis often presents with fever, headache, and meningeal findings such as neck stiffness and photophobia.
10. **Key Point:** ICU-acquired weakness is prevalent in patients with critical illness and can occur within a week of ICU presentation; electromyography and nerve conduction study testing remain the gold standard for diagnosis.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. ICU-acquired weakness may first be suspected when patients fail to wean from mechanical ventilation.
7. Neurologic symptoms of epidural abscess can include urinary retention, bowel incontinence, motor and sensory weakness, and radicular pain.
8. Myasthenic crisis can progress to diffuse weakness involving respiratory musculature, but typically requires a history of myasthenia gravis.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Between 25% and 100% of critically ill patients develop muscle weakness.
2. Muscle weakness in critically ill patients may result from critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, neuromyopathy, or nonspecific ICU-acquired weakness without electrophysiologic or histologic evidence of myopathy or neuropathy.
3. Identified risk factors for ICU-acquired weakness include sepsis, multisystem organ failure, severe illness, prolonged immobility, early administration of parenteral nutrition, premorbid frailty, and elevated glucose or lactate levels.
4. Evidence linking prolonged neuromuscular blockade to ICU-acquired weakness is conflicting.
5. Obesity may be protective against ICU-acquired weakness.
6. ICU-acquired weakness generally improves over weeks to months but may persist for years.
7. Strategies to minimize ICU-acquired weakness include aggressive management of critical illness, early mobilization, avoidance of early parenteral nutrition, and management of hyperglycemia.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Electromyography and nerve conduction study testing is often necessary because of overlapping features of the different causes of weakness.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Definitions and Characteristics of ICU-Acquired Weakness)
1. ICU-acquired weakness is characterized by clinically detected weakness with no explanation other than the critical illness.
2. ICU-acquired weakness presents with proximal and distal symmetrical flaccid weakness with sparing of cranial nerves.
3. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation is often the first indication of ICU-acquired weakness.
4. ICU-acquired weakness is a diagnosis of exclusion.
5. Critical illness polyneuropathy presents with quadriparesis or quadriplegia, decreased muscle tone, sparing of facial muscles, and decreased deep tendon reflexes.
6. Critical illness myopathy is associated with elevated creatine kinase and examination findings similar to critical illness polyneuropathy.
7. Critical illness neuromyopathy represents the coexistence of polyneuropathy and myopathy and is perhaps the most prevalent form.
