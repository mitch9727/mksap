### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Evaluation of Hypotension and Shock

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Shock** occurs when **systemic tissue perfusion** is insufficient to meet the body's **cellular metabolic demands** and usually manifests as **hypotension and organ dysfunction**.  
2. The presence of **hypotension alone** is **not diagnostic of shock**.  
3. **Blood pressure** should be interpreted in the context of **end-organ hypoperfusion findings** such as **altered mental status**, **skin mottling**, **increased capillary refill time**, **decreased urine output**, **tachycardia**, and **tachypnea**.  
4. Elevated **serum lactate** and **creatinine** levels, although nonspecific, may suggest **tissue hypoperfusion**.  
5. In **patients with cirrhosis**, **hypotension in the absence of shock** is common due to **splanchnic and systemic vasodilation** and **decreased responsiveness to intrinsic catecholamines**.  
6. In asymptomatic patients with **hypotension but no end-organ damage or hypoperfusion**, **reassurance without further evaluation** is appropriate.  
7. **Echocardiography (Echo)** is indicated in suspected **cardiogenic shock**, **pericardial tamponade**, or **acute valvular disease**, but not in asymptomatic patients without cardiac findings.  
8. **Crystalloid infusion** (such as **lactated Ringer solution**) is appropriate in **hypovolemia** and many forms of **shock**, but not in **asymptomatic euvolemic cirrhosis**, where it may worsen **ascites** or **edema**.  
9. **Vasopressin** is a potent **arteriolar vasoconstrictor** useful in **shock**, but not indicated in patients without shock.  
10. Initial management of most forms of **shock** focuses on **fluid resuscitation** rather than immediate vasopressor therapy.

#### 💬 Extra
5. Hypotension in cirrhosis often reflects chronic vasodilatory physiology rather than acute circulatory collapse.  
8. Avoiding unnecessary crystalloids in cirrhosis prevents worsening ascites or peripheral edema.  
9. High doses of vasopressin may decrease cardiac output and cause myocardial ischemia.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Shock** occurs when **systemic tissue perfusion** is inadequate, leading initially to **reversible tissue injury** and eventually to **cellular dysfunction and death** if uncorrected.  
2. The four primary mechanisms of **shock** are **hypovolemic (decreased circulating volume)**, **cardiogenic (pump failure)**, **obstructive (circulatory obstruction)**, and **distributive (inappropriate vasodilation)**.  
3. **Hypotension alone** should not be considered diagnostic of **end-organ hypoperfusion**.  
4. Diagnosis of **shock type** requires a combination of **physical examination**, **laboratory results**, and **ancillary studies**.  
5. **Point-of-care ultrasonography** is increasingly used to assess **shock**, including **echocardiography**, **vascular**, **lung**, and **abdominal ultrasonography**.  
6. **Pulmonary artery catheters** show limited benefit and possible harm with routine use, but may help in select patients requiring precise **cardiopulmonary pressure** or **cardiac output** measurement.  
7. **Pulse contour analysis**, **pulse pressure variation**, and **stroke volume variation** can estimate **cardiac output**, particularly in **intubated, passively respiring patients** receiving **tidal volumes &gt;8 mL/kg**.  
8. **Distributive shock** is most often caused by **sepsis**, but other disease states may present similarly.  
9. Initial treatment of **distributive shock** focuses on **fluid resuscitation**, preferably with **crystalloids** over **colloids** due to cost considerations and safety.  
10. Balanced crystalloid solutions (e.g., **lactated Ringer solution**) are generally favored over **0.9% saline**, although superiority is not conclusively proven.  
11. If fluids are inadequate in distributive shock, **vasopressor support** is warranted, with selection based on **comorbidities** and **shock etiology**.  
12. **Hypovolemic shock** results from decreased **intravascular volume**, reducing **preload**, **ventricular filling**, and **stroke volume**.  
13. Treatment of **hypovolemic shock** involves **volume replacement** and control of the **source of fluid or blood loss**.  
14. In **hemorrhagic shock**, initial stabilization may use **intravenous fluids**, but **erythrocyte transfusion** is often required to prevent ischemia.  
15. In stable ICU patients with hemorrhage, maintain **hemoglobin &gt;7 g/dL (70 g/L)**; higher thresholds may be required in **active bleeding** or **ischemia**.  
16. **Cardiogenic shock** most commonly results from **myocardial infarction**, with other causes including **arrhythmias** and **valvular disease**.  
17. **Echocardiography** is essential in evaluating **cardiogenic shock**.  
18. **Revascularization** improves survival in **ST-elevation myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock**, regardless of ischemia duration.  
19. First-line vasopressors in **cardiogenic shock** include **norepinephrine** and **dobutamine**, with advanced support (e.g., **venoarterial ECMO**, **intra-aortic balloon pump**) as potential bridges.  
20. **Obstructive shock** arises from extracardiac forces impairing cardiac output, including **cardiac tamponade**, **tension pneumothorax**, and **acute pulmonary embolism**.  
21. **Point-of-care ultrasonography** can rapidly identify **pneumothorax**, **pericardial tamponade**, or **pulmonary embolism** in suspected **obstructive shock**.  
22. Most cases of **obstructive shock** can be rapidly reversed if promptly identified.

#### 💬 Extra
2. These four categories are not mutually exclusive; overlap can occur.  
10. Balanced crystalloid preference appears in contemporary sepsis guidance, but mortality benefit remains uncertain.  
15. Higher transfusion thresholds may be considered in **acute coronary syndrome**.  
19. Advanced support devices are not definitive therapy but serve as bridges until revascularization or recovery.  
20. Hemodynamics of obstructive shock often mimic cardiogenic shock, requiring careful diagnostic distinction.
