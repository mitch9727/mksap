### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Obstructive Shock from Tension Pneumothorax

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Obstructive shock** occurs when **extravascular forces impair cardiac output** despite normal cardiac function.  
2. Common causes of **obstructive shock** include **cardiac tamponade**, **tension pneumothorax**, and **acute pulmonary embolism**.  
3. In **tension pneumothorax**, hypotension develops from **increased pleural pressures** causing **venous compression** and **diminished venous return to the right atrium**.  
4. **Tension pneumothorax** can cause **atelectasis** and **hypoxic vasoconstriction**, which increase **pulmonary vascular resistance** and **right ventricular afterload**.  
5. **Pneumothorax** is common in patients with **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** who require **mechanical ventilation**.  
6. Patients with **tension pneumothorax** typically have **decreased or absent lung sounds** on the affected side; **tracheal deviation** may also be present.  
7. **Point-of-care lung ultrasonography** can rapidly diagnose **pneumothorax** in critically ill patients.  
8. The **lung point sign** on ultrasonography is diagnostic of **pneumothorax**.  
9. Management of **tension pneumothorax** includes **immediate needle decompression of the affected thoracic space** followed by **thoracostomy tube insertion**.  
10. In unstable patients with **strong suspicion of tension pneumothorax**, **needle decompression should not be delayed** if imaging is not immediately available.  
11. **Obstructive shock secondary to tension pneumothorax** is often associated with **decreased or absent lung sounds** on the affected side, and the diagnosis can be made rapidly with **point-of-care lung ultrasonography**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. The **pathophysiology** of obstructive shock in tension pneumothorax is venous return impairment, leading to reduced preload and cardiac output.  
4. Hypoxic vasoconstriction is a compensatory mechanism that worsens pulmonary vascular resistance.  
7. Lung ultrasound is faster than chest radiography and is especially useful in unstable ICU patients.  
8. The **lung point sign** represents the transition point between normal lung sliding and pneumothorax.

#### ✅ True Statements — Obstructive Shock
1. **Obstructive shock** is caused by **extracardiac forces** that impair **cardiac output** despite normal cardiac function.  
2. Examples of **obstructive shock** include **cardiac tamponade**, **tension pneumothorax**, and **acute pulmonary embolism**.  
3. **Hemodynamics** of obstructive shock frequently **mimic cardiogenic shock**, but the **clinical presentation varies** depending on the cause.  
4. **History and physical examination** should guide **ancillary testing and management** in obstructive shock.  
5. **Point-of-care lung ultrasonography** helps rapidly assess patients for **pneumothorax**.  
6. **Echocardiography** can identify **pericardial tamponade** and sometimes **pulmonary embolism**.  
7. In **constrictive or restrictive pericarditis** or **pulmonary arterial hypertension**, **invasive hemodynamic evaluation** of cardiopulmonary pressures confirms diagnosis.  
8. Most cases of **obstructive shock can be rapidly reversed** if promptly identified.

#### 💬 Extra
3. The mimicry of **cardiogenic shock** makes timely differentiation critical.  
7. Right heart catheterization is the invasive modality for pulmonary pressures.
