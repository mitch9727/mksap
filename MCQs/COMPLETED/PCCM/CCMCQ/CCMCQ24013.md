### 🦠 Critical Care Medicine: Evaluation of Suspected Sepsis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The most appropriate next step in management in patients suspected of having sepsis is to obtain **blood cultures** if this does not delay antibiotics.
2. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign “1-hour bundle” includes collection of blood cultures, measurement of serum lactate levels, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and provision of fluid or vasopressor resuscitation in patients with hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion.
3. Obtaining blood cultures early (within 1 hour) after onset of suspected sepsis is associated with lower mortality.
4. When antibiotics are administered before obtaining blood cultures, the microbiologic yield can decrease by as much as 50%.
5. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests obtaining blood cultures before starting antimicrobial therapy if this results in no substantial delay in antimicrobials (i.e., less than 45 minutes).
6. **Key Point:** If not leading to a delay in antibiotic therapy, blood cultures should be obtained in patients suspected of having sepsis or septic shock before antibiotic treatment is started.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Vasopressor therapy is not the initial step in sepsis management; intravenous fluids are first-line if hypotension or hypoperfusion is present.
2. Measurement of procalcitonin is not sufficiently specific or sensitive to guide initiation of antimicrobial therapy in suspected sepsis.
4. Echocardiography is useful in cardiogenic shock or tamponade but is not indicated in uncomplicated sepsis.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of sepsis improve survival.
2. The sepsis “1-hour bundle” includes blood cultures before antibiotics (if no delay), serum lactate measurement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation or vasopressors for hypotension or hypoperfusion.
3. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends an initial bolus of 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid within the first 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, with initiation ideally within the first hour.
4. Albumin is not preferred for initial resuscitation because of higher cost and no proven additional benefit compared with crystalloids.
5. Hypotension persisting after fluids should be managed with norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy.
6. Vasopressin may be added when norepinephrine alone is insufficient, and epinephrine may be added for persistent shock despite norepinephrine and vasopressin.
7. Dopamine is associated with increased tachyarrhythmia and death compared with norepinephrine and is not recommended for septic shock except in patients with significant bradycardia.
8. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered within 1 hour of suspected sepsis, with subsequent adjustment based on culture results.
9. Early drainage of abscesses and removal of infected catheters are essential in sepsis management.
10. Procalcitonin is not recommended for initial initiation of antibiotics but may be used to guide discontinuation or shortening of therapy.
11. Pulmonary artery catheter use does not improve outcomes in septic shock and may increase complications and mortality.
12. Glucocorticoids are recommended in septic shock unresponsive to fluids and vasopressors but not in sepsis without shock.
13. In septic shock, hydrocortisone 200 mg daily in divided doses is recommended if refractory shock persists.
14. Tight glucose control (80–110 mg/dL) in ICU patients increases risk of severe hypoglycemia and death; a target glucose range of 140–200 mg/dL is recommended in sepsis.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Dynamic assessment methods (e.g., passive leg raise) may be used to evaluate fluid responsiveness in sepsis resuscitation.
5. Higher mean arterial pressure targets may be appropriate for patients with chronic hypertension to reduce kidney replacement therapy risk.
8. Empiric regimens may include a carbapenem or extended-range penicillin with β-lactamase inhibitor; coverage for resistant organisms should be considered when risk factors exist.
10. Evidence for procalcitonin in guiding therapy duration is mixed, leading to heterogeneity in clinical use.
12. Glucocorticoid therapy shortens shock duration and length of stay but may cause hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, or neuromuscular weakness.
