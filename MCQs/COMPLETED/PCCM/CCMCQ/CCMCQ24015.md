# 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Procalcitonin for Antibiotic De-escalation in Sepsis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Procalcitonin** is a serum marker for **bacterial infection**.  
2. **Procalcitonin and clinical evaluation** may be used to support **shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy** in patients with **sepsis and adequate source control**.  
3. **Algorithms including procalcitonin** as a decision support tool lead to **decreased overall use of antibiotics**, especially in **suspected lower respiratory tract infections**.  
4. In **immunocompetent patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** and **absence of shock**, a **procalcitonin level <0.5 ng/mL** should prompt consideration of **antibiotic discontinuation**.  
5. **Short courses of antibiotics** are as effective as **longer courses (>7 days)** for treating **community-acquired pneumonia**, assuming **clinical improvement**.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. Adequate source control means drainage or removal of infection focus, e.g., abscess or infected catheter.  
5. Shorter antibiotic courses reduce resistance and adverse events while maintaining efficacy.

#### ✅ True Statements — Antibiotic Therapy
1. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics** should be given **immediately (ideally within 1 hour)** when **sepsis** is suspected.  
2. **Cultures from potential sources of infection** should be obtained promptly but should **not delay antibiotic administration**.  
3. **Early drainage of abscesses** and **removal of infected intravenous catheters** are essential in sepsis management.  
4. **Delay in the first antibiotic dose** or use of **inappropriate therapy** increases **sepsis mortality**.  
5. **Initial empiric antibiotic therapy** in sepsis should be **broad enough to cover gram-negative, gram-positive, and mixed bacterial pathogens**, with consideration for **viral or fungal coverage** when warranted.  
6. Selection of empiric antibiotics should consider **source of sepsis**, **local resistance patterns**, and **patient history** (e.g., indwelling catheter, neutropenia, immunocompromise, prior antibiotics, or recent health care exposure).  
7. **Carbapenems** or **extended-spectrum penicillins plus β-lactamase inhibitors** are appropriate initial empiric regimens in many patients with sepsis.  
8. If risks for **multidrug resistance** are present, empiric therapy should include **double gram-negative coverage** or **targeted methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage**.  
9. When available, **facility-specific antibiograms** should guide empiric antibiotic choice.  
10. Once a **pathogen is identified**, antibiotics should be **narrowed to the most effective regimen**.  
11. If cultures are negative, **de-escalation of antibiotics** is generally recommended within the first few days if the patient is **clinically improving**.  
12. **Optimal antibiotic duration** in septic shock depends on **site of infection**, **pathogen**, and **therapy administered**; in general, **the shortest effective duration** is recommended.  
13. **Infectious disease consultation** improves sepsis outcomes and may decrease **antibiotic duration**.  
14. In **neutropenic patients**, antibiotics should continue until the **full course is complete** or **neutropenia resolves (neutrophil count >500/µL [0.5 × 10⁹/L])**, whichever is later.  
15. **Procalcitonin** should not be used to decide **whether to start antibiotics**, but may support **shortening therapy** or **discontinuing antibiotics** in patients initially thought to have sepsis.  
16. **Algorithms using procalcitonin** decrease **overall antibiotic use**, particularly in **lower respiratory tract infections**, though **mortality benefit** remains uncertain.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Rapid administration of antibiotics is one of the strongest predictors of sepsis survival.  
8. Multidrug resistance risks include prior hospitalization, prior antibiotic exposure, and immunocompromised states.  
15. Procalcitonin is not reliable for initiation decisions because it may be elevated in non-infectious inflammatory states.
