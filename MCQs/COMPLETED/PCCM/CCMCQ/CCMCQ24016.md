### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Refractory Septic Shock

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In **septic shock** that remains **hemodynamically unstable despite intravenous fluids and vasopressor therapy**, administration of **empiric glucocorticoids** is indicated.
2. Administration of **glucocorticoids** in **refractory septic shock** is associated with **faster shock recovery** and **decreased hospital length of stay**.
3. **Mortality benefit** of glucocorticoid use in refractory septic shock has **not been clearly established**.
4. **Hydrocortisone** is the preferred glucocorticoid in refractory septic shock, typically dosed **200 mg daily in 3–4 divided doses**.
5. **Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing** is **not recommended** before starting glucocorticoids in septic shock.
6. **Adverse effects** of glucocorticoids in refractory septic shock include **increased neuromuscular weakness**, **hypernatremia**, and **hyperglycemia**.
7. Glucocorticoids have **no role in treating sepsis without shock**, unless another indication is present.
8. Patients receiving **vasopressor therapy** for septic shock should have an **arterial catheter** for continuous blood pressure monitoring.
9. Use of a **pulmonary artery catheter** in septic shock does **not improve outcomes** and is associated with **higher resource use**, **higher complication rates**, and **possibly higher mortality**.
10. In **sepsis and septic shock**, guidelines recommend initiating **glucose therapy** when **serum glucose ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)**.
11. In critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock, the **target glucose range** is **140–200 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L)**.
12. **Tight glucose control** (80–110 mg/dL [4.4–6.1 mmol/L]) in critically ill patients increases the risk of **severe hypoglycemia** and may increase **mortality**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Statement 1–2: Relative adrenal insufficiency contributes to refractory hypotension in septic shock.
4. Guidelines specify **hydrocortisone** rather than other glucocorticoids as the agent of choice.
10–12. Liberal glucose targets avoid hypoglycemia while maintaining safe glycemic control.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pulmonary artery catheters** do **not improve outcomes** in patients with **septic shock** and may increase **complications**, **resource use**, and **mortality**.
2. Patients with **septic shock** receiving **vasopressors** may require an **arterial catheter** for **continuous blood pressure monitoring**.
3. **Relative adrenal insufficiency** contributes to **refractory hypotension** in septic shock.
4. **Glucocorticoids** in septic shock are associated with **faster recovery** and **shorter length of stay**, but not with **mortality benefit**.
5. **Adverse effects** of glucocorticoids in septic shock include **neuromuscular weakness**, **hypernatremia**, and **hyperglycemia**.
6. For refractory septic shock, guidelines recommend **hydrocortisone 200 mg daily in divided doses**.
7. **Glucocorticoids** have **no role** in treating **sepsis without shock**.
8. **Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing** is **not recommended** before starting glucocorticoids in septic shock.
9. **Tight glucose control** (80–110 mg/dL [4.4–6.1 mmol/L]) in critically ill patients increases the risk of **severe hypoglycemia** and sometimes **death**.
10. Guidelines recommend starting **glucose-lowering therapy** in septic shock when **serum glucose ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)**.
11. The **target glucose range** in critically ill patients with septic shock is **140–200 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L)**.

#### 💬 Extra
1–2. Pulmonary artery catheters are not used for routine management of septic shock; arterial catheters remain standard for vasopressor monitoring.
6. The recommended regimen is **hydrocortisone**, divided 3–4 times daily, not a single daily bolus.
9–11. Large trials demonstrated worse outcomes with intensive glucose control compared to moderate glucose targets.
