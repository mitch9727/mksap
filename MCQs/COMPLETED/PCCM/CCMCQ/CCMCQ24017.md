### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Lung protective ventilation** with a tidal volume of 4 to 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of less than 30 cm H2O is the cornerstone of treatment for **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**.
2. Lung protective ventilation improves patient outcomes, including a decrease in mortality in ARDS.
3. ARDS lung injury is not homogeneous; it is characterized by areas of low-compliance lung adjacent to more normal compliance lung.
4. The more compliant portions of lung are susceptible to **overdistention and injury** (volutrauma) from tidal volume.
5. Application of **positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)** in ARDS helps in alveolar recruitment and prevents recollapse of difficult-to-recruit lung units, thereby improving oxygenation.
6. Low tidal volume ventilation may result in low minute ventilation and hypercapnia, often necessitating an increase in respiration rate.
7. High concentrations of inspired oxygen (FiO2 >0.60, especially with longer exposure) are associated with acute lung injury.
8. **Key Point:** Lung protective ventilation (tidal volume of 4-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight and maintaining a plateau pressure <30 cm H2O) is strongly recommended in all patients with ARDS.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Decreasing the tidal volume from 8 mL/kg to 6 mL/kg may improve plateau pressure to the desired level (<30 cm H2O).
5. Decreasing PEEP is unnecessary when PEEP is modest (e.g., 8 cm H2O) and oxygenation is maintained (PaO2 >55 mm Hg).
6. Increasing respiration rate can mitigate hypercapnia from lung protective ventilation.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Most patients with ARDS are managed with **invasive mechanical ventilation**.
2. Use of **low tidal volume ventilation** and **PEEP** are cornerstones of ARDS management and improve patient outcomes.
3. Guidelines recommend a **tidal volume of 4 to 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight** and **plateau pressure <30 cm H2O**, based on evidence showing an 11% absolute reduction in mortality.
4. PEEP prevents **atelectrauma** caused by repeated opening and closing of distal airways and alveoli.
5. PEEP improves lung homogeneity and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch by maintaining alveolar recruitment.
6. No universal level of optimal PEEP in ARDS has been established.
7. The favored method of selecting optimal PEEP is to use a **PEEP-FiO2 table**, matching PEEP to FiO2 needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of 88% to 95%.
8. Guidelines conditionally recommend using **higher PEEP**, but not recruitment maneuvers, in moderate to severe ARDS.
9. **Prone positioning** (12 to 16 hours per day) reduces compression of lung regions, improves V/Q matching, and improves mortality in severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <150 mm Hg with FiO2 ≥0.6).
10. **Venovenous ECMO** is a therapeutic option for severe ARDS patients unresponsive to conventional therapy, and early evaluation for ECMO is recommended.
11. Other ventilatory strategies (inverse ratio ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, esophageal pressure monitoring, driving pressure-guided titration, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) have not shown mortality benefit in ARDS.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
4. PEEP improves homogeneity by reducing regional compliance differences between diseased and compliant lung areas.
9. Prone positioning should be initiated early (within 48 hours) in severe ARDS.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: PEEP-FiO2 Table for Selecting PEEP in ARDS)
1. The PEEP-FiO2 table matches PEEP levels to FiO2 requirements to guide ventilation in patients with ARDS.
2. PEEP increases as FiO2 requirements increase, ranging from 5 cm H2O at FiO2 0.3 to 18–24 cm H2O at FiO2 1.0.
3. The table is based on recommendations from the NIH–National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. PEEP of 8 to 10 cm H2O is typically paired with FiO2 0.4–0.5, while higher FiO2 values (≥0.7) are paired with PEEP of 12–18+ cm H2O.
