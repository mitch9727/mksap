### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Noninvasive Ventilation in Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema** usually responds promptly to therapy with **diuretics** and **vasodilators**.  
2. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation** (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or bilevel positive airway pressure) **hastens the resolution of hypoxemia**, **reduces preload and afterload**, **improves symptoms**, **lowers intubation rates**, and **decreases mortality** compared with **oxygen therapy alone**.  
3. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation should be considered in **all patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and hypoxemic respiratory failure** who do not respond promptly to appropriate medical therapy.  
4. **Loop diuretics** may be continued in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but there is **no evidence** for more rapid symptom control when administered as **continuous infusion versus bolus dosing**.  
5. **Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation** may be necessary if a patient does not respond to medical therapy and CPAP or is intolerant of CPAP.  
6. In **acute decompensated heart failure**, **pharmacologic therapy** is superior to **ultrafiltration** for control of symptoms and preservation of kidney function, and ultrafiltration is associated with a higher complication rate.  
7. In cardiogenic pulmonary edema, **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation** reduces the need for intubation and **lowers mortality** compared with oxygen therapy alone.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Both CPAP and bilevel positive airway pressure provide benefit through preload/afterload reduction and improved oxygenation.  
4. Bolus dosing of loop diuretics remains standard in acute settings.  
6. Ultrafiltration is reserved for selected refractory cases due to complication risk.

#### ✅ True Statements — Acute Heart Failure
1. **Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema** often presents with **hypoxemic respiratory failure**.  
2. All patients presenting with **acute respiratory failure** should be evaluated for **cardiogenic causes**, including **cardiomyopathy**, **mitral valve disease**, **aortic valve disease**, **myocardial ischemia**, and **arrhythmias** (especially atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate).  
3. Evaluation of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema should include: assessment for **volume overload** (jugular venous distention, S3, peripheral edema), **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** level, **serial serum troponin levels**, and **echocardiography**.  
4. In acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, therapy to **reduce preload and afterload** with **vasodilators** or **inodilators** produces rapid improvement, while **diuretics** play a role in longer-term management of fluid overload.  
5. Systematic reviews show that **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation** in cardiogenic pulmonary edema **hastens resolution of hypoxemia**, **reduces preload and afterload**, **improves symptoms**, **lowers intubation rates**, and **decreases mortality** compared with **oxygen therapy alone**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response are common precipitants of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  
3. BNP and troponin testing help differentiate heart failure from alternative causes of respiratory distress.  
4. Diuretics provide slower relief but are essential in ongoing fluid management.
