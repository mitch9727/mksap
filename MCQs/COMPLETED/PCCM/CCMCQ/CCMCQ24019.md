### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome with Prone Positioning

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)** and **low tidal volume ventilation** are cornerstones of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) management and are associated with improved patient outcomes.  
2. In patients with **severe ARDS** (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio <150 mm Hg and FiO₂ ≥0.6), **prone positioning within 48 hours** is associated with decreased risk of death.  
3. The mortality benefit of prone positioning is likely due to improved ventilation to the dorsal portion of the lung, improving the ventilation-perfusion ratio and reducing risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.  
4. **Prone positioning for at least 12 to 16 hours daily** should be considered for all patients with severe ARDS in addition to PEEP and low tidal volume ventilation.  
5. **Permissive hypercapnia** is an accepted strategy in ARDS, and mild respiratory acidemia is not harmful.  
6. **Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)** is recommended as a rescue therapy for patients with ARDS who remain severely hypoxemic (PaO₂/FiO₂ <80 mm Hg) despite optimal ventilatory management and prone positioning.  
7. **Inhaled nitric oxide** improves ventilation-perfusion mismatch but does not reduce morbidity or mortality in ARDS.  
8. **Key Point:** Prone positioning for 12 to 16 hours daily should be considered in patients with severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ <150 mm Hg and FiO₂ ≥0.6).  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Improved ventilation in the dorsal lung during prone positioning reduces the risk of overdistention and ventilator-induced injury.  
5. Mild respiratory acidosis from permissive hypercapnia is tolerated in ARDS.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Most patients with ARDS are managed with **invasive mechanical ventilation**.  
2. Use of **low tidal volume ventilation** and **PEEP** are cornerstones of ARDS management and improve patient outcomes.  
3. Guidelines recommend a **tidal volume of 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight** and **plateau pressure <30 cm H₂O**, based on evidence showing an 11% absolute mortality reduction.  
4. PEEP prevents **atelectrauma** caused by repeated opening and closing of alveoli.  
5. PEEP improves lung homogeneity and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch by maintaining alveolar recruitment.  
6. No universal optimal PEEP level has been established for ARDS.  
7. A **PEEP-FiO₂ table** is the favored method of selecting optimal PEEP, matching PEEP to FiO₂ needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of 88–95%.  
8. Guidelines conditionally recommend **higher PEEP** in moderate to severe ARDS but not recruitment maneuvers.  
9. **Prone positioning** (12–16 hours per day) reduces compression of lung regions, improves V/Q matching, and lowers mortality in severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ <150 mm Hg with FiO₂ ≥0.6).  
10. **Venovenous ECMO** is a therapeutic option for severe ARDS patients unresponsive to conventional therapy, and early ECMO evaluation is recommended.  
11. Other ventilatory strategies (inverse ratio ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, esophageal pressure monitoring, driving pressure-guided titration, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) have not shown mortality benefit in ARDS.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
4. PEEP improves homogeneity by reducing compliance differences between diseased and healthy lung regions.  
9. Prone positioning is most effective when initiated early (within 48 hours) in severe ARDS.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: PEEP-FiO2 Table for Selecting PEEP in ARDS)
1. The PEEP-FiO₂ table matches PEEP levels to FiO₂ requirements for ventilating patients with ARDS.  
2. PEEP increases as FiO₂ increases, ranging from 5 cm H₂O at FiO₂ 0.3 to 18–24 cm H₂O at FiO₂ 1.0.  
3. The table is based on recommendations from the **NIH–National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Network**.  

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. PEEP of 8–10 cm H₂O is paired with FiO₂ 0.4–0.5, while FiO₂ ≥0.7 is paired with PEEP 12–18+ cm H₂O.
