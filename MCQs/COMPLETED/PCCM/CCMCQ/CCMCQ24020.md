### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of Upper Airway Obstruction

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute epiglottitis** is a severe inflammatory condition that can cause partial or complete **upper airway obstruction**.  
2. Findings suggesting **partial airway obstruction** include tachypnea, stridor, increased respiratory effort, and an upright (tripod) posture with use of accessory muscles.  
3. Inspiratory stridor suggests **obstruction at or above the vocal cords**, whereas expiratory stridor suggests an **intrathoracic process**.  
4. High-grade airway obstruction should be suspected with absent air movement, inability to talk, or cyanosis.  
5. Pulse oximetry in partial upper airway obstruction is often normal, and oxygen desaturation is a late or preterminal finding.  
6. In patients with respiratory distress or high risk for respiratory deterioration, **early intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube** is indicated.  
7. Endotracheal intubation for acute upper airway obstruction should be performed early and in a controlled setting by clinicians with expertise in **difficult airway management** and emergent tracheostomy.  
8. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation has no established role in treating **upper airway obstruction** outside of obstructive sleep apnea.  
9. A helium-oxygen mixture may reduce the work of breathing in severe airway obstruction, but it is not supported for use in epiglottitis.  
10. The use of **racemic epinephrine** in acute epiglottitis is controversial and not supported by evidence.  
11. **Key Point:** Endotracheal intubation should be performed early and in a controlled setting in critically ill patients with worsening upper airway obstruction.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Inspiratory stridor is more specific for obstruction at or above the vocal cords, whereas expiratory stridor is linked to intrathoracic causes.  
5. The absence of hypoxemia in partial upper airway obstruction may lead clinicians to underestimate severity.  
7. Operating rooms are preferred locations for intubation in high-risk airway obstruction.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Intubation with a cuffed endotracheal tube under direct or indirect laryngoscopy is the standard of care in patients unable to maintain a patent airway or protect against aspiration.  
2. A 2023 multicenter randomized trial found that **video laryngoscopy** increased successful intubation rates compared with direct laryngoscopy in critically ill patients.  
3. **Oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or supraglottic devices** such as a laryngeal mask airway can temporarily aid oxygenation and ventilation until the airway is secured.  
4. Absent air movement, inability to talk, or cyanosis suggests **complete airway obstruction**.  
5. Pulse oximetry in partial upper airway obstruction with stridor is usually normal and should not be considered reassuring.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Supraglottic devices can provide short-term ventilation support if immediate intubation is not possible.
