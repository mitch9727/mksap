### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Postoperative Atelectasis Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Postoperative atelectasis** is a common cause of **hypoxemia** after **upper abdominal surgery**.  
2. Risk factors for **postoperative atelectasis** include **smoking**, **obesity**, and **older age**.  
3. **Shallow breathing**, **weak cough** due to pain, **diaphragmatic dysfunction**, and **anesthesia-induced impairment of the mucociliary escalator** predispose to **respiratory secretion accumulation** and **reduced functional residual capacity (FRC)**.  
4. **Atelectasis** occurs when **functional residual capacity** drops below **closing volume** during tidal breaths.  
5. Management of **postoperative atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, **secretion management**, and **respiratory physiotherapy**.  
6. **Respiratory physiotherapy** methods for atelectasis prevention and treatment include **inspiratory muscle training**, **deep breathing exercise**, **mobility programs**, and **percussion and vibration therapy**.  
7. For patients with **postoperative atelectasis**, **bronchoscopy** for routine airway mucous clearance offers **no clear benefit** compared with chest physiotherapy.  
8. **Bronchoscopy** should be considered only if **24 hours of chest physiotherapy** fails to improve atelectasis.

#### 💬 Extra
3. **Functional residual capacity (FRC)** is the volume of air present in the lungs at the end of passive expiration.  
4. **Closing volume** is the lung volume at which dependent airways begin to close during expiration.

#### ✅ True Statements — Atelectasis
1. **Atelectasis** is a common **postoperative complication**.  
2. Pain or impaired **respiratory mechanics** after thoracic and abdominal surgeries can cause **shallow breathing** and **reduced coughing**.  
3. Clinical findings of **atelectasis** may include **labored breathing**, **diminished breath sounds at the lung bases**, **egophony**, **rhonchi**, and **consolidation on imaging**.  
4. Management of **atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, and **secretion management**.  
5. **Respiratory physiotherapy** helps prevent and treat **atelectasis**.  
6. **Bronchoscopy** for routine mucous clearance provides **no clear benefit** compared with chest physiotherapy and should only be considered if **24 hours of physiotherapy fails**.  
7. If respiratory secretions are minimal, **positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices** may be used to **recruit collapsed alveoli**.  
8. There is **no evidence** supporting the use of **mucolytics** such as **N-acetylcysteine** for the treatment of **atelectasis**.

#### 💬 Extra
7. **Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices** generate back pressure during exhalation that helps reopen collapsed alveoli.
