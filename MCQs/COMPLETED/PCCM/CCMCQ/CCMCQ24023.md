### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Treatment of Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure with High-Flow Nasal Cannula

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)** oxygen therapy improves oxygenation and may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.  
2. HFNC reliably delivers high fractions of inspired oxygen (Fio2) and generates a small amount of positive airway pressure (4–5 cm H2O).  
3. HFNC improves oxygenation, reduces respiratory rate and physiologic dead space, decreases work of breathing, and improves mucociliary clearance and patient comfort in pneumonia-related respiratory failure.  
4. Compared with conventional oxygen therapy and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), HFNC decreases the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, though its effect on mortality is less certain.  
5. Guidelines recommend HFNC in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure because the reduced risk for intubation is important to patients.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. HFNC is superior to NPPV in managing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia.  
1. Patients with nausea and vomiting are not suitable candidates for bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP).  
3. Furosemide is not indicated in hypoxemic respiratory failure without evidence of heart failure or pulmonary edema.  
4. Intubation and mechanical ventilation should be delayed until an adequate HFNC trial has been attempted, especially if the patient wishes to avoid intubation.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. High-flow delivery devices mix and humidify air and oxygen at ≥30 L/min to deliver a consistent fraction of oxygen through a nasal cannula or mask.  
2. True high flow is usually ≥45 L/min, which exceeds most patients' ability to entrain ambient air in addition to the delivered mixture.  
3. The amount of positive airway pressure generated by HFNC depends on the flow rate and cannot be precisely quantified.  
4. High-flow systems can decrease respiratory rate, work of breathing, and dead space, and they enhance patient comfort.  
5. Systematic reviews have found no difference in hypoxemic events when HFNC is compared with other oxygenation methods used before and during intubation.  
6. In acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC may decrease the need for intubation but has not demonstrated a mortality benefit.  
7. In patients with COVID-19, HFNC significantly reduced rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation but did not affect mortality.  
8. In the postextubation period, HFNC may reduce the risk of recurrent respiratory failure and reintubation compared with conventional oxygen therapy.  
9. In high-risk patients after extubation (age ≥65 years or with chronic heart/lung disease), HFNC alone is less effective in preventing reintubation than HFNC plus noninvasive ventilation.  
10. For maximum effectiveness, noninvasive ventilation after extubation should be used at least 12 hours per day, with continuous use at night.  
11. HFNC initiation should occur in the critical care setting with close monitoring for tolerance and effectiveness.  
12. The ROX index, defined as Spo2/Fio2 (%) divided by respiratory rate (breaths/min), helps identify patients at risk for intubation while receiving HFNC.  
13. A ROX index ≥4.88 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after HFNC initiation predicts decreased risk of intubation.  
14. A ROX index <2.85 at 2 hours, <3.47 at 6 hours, or <3.85 at 12 hours predicts HFNC failure and increased risk for intubation.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
9. High-risk postextubation patients benefit most from a combined strategy of HFNC and noninvasive ventilation.
