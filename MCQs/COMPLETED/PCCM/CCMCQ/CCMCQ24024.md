### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of acute COPD exacerbation with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with a **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation** and **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with acidosis**, **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** improves symptoms and reduces intubation rates, length of hospital stay, and mortality.
2. **Noninvasive PPV** is commonly administered as **bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** with a higher inspiratory positive airway pressure and a lower expiratory positive airway pressure.
3. Inspiratory support in BPAP offloads inspiratory muscles and reduces the work of breathing.
4. Expiratory positive airway pressure in BPAP counters dynamic hyperinflation and further reduces inspiratory muscle workload.
5. Noninvasive PPV is useful in patients with **COPD exacerbations**, **cardiogenic pulmonary edema**, **neuromuscular disease**, and **obesity hypoventilation syndrome**.
6. After initiation of noninvasive PPV, close monitoring is necessary for tolerance, adverse effects, ventilatory parameters, and clinical status.
7. Improvement of blood pH and Pco2 within 1 to 2 hours after starting noninvasive PPV predicts success.
8. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who cannot protect their airway, are hemodynamically unstable, have contraindications to noninvasive PPV, or do not improve with it.
9. **Key Point:** In patients with a COPD exacerbation and acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with acidosis, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation improves symptoms and reduces intubation rates, length of hospital stay, and mortality.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Adverse effects of noninvasive PPV include skin breakdown, gastric distention, and eye irritation.
6. Monitoring parameters include patient comfort, skin integrity, gastric distention, eye irritation, tidal volume, respiration rate, blood pH, oxygen saturation, and mental status.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivers a constant airway pressure during inspiration and expiration.
2. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) delivers a higher level of positive airway pressure during inspiration than expiration, providing additional inspiratory support and increased tidal volume.
3. The support with BPAP is titrated to an appropriate level of gas exchange and to optimize patient respiratory effort.
4. Some BPAP devices can be programmed with a minimum respiration rate (spontaneous/timed mode).
5. Average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) integrates characteristics of volume- and pressure-controlled ventilation and may be better tolerated than BPAP by some patients.
6. Evidence supports use of noninvasive PPV in acute exacerbation of COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and neuromuscular disease.
7. Noninvasive PPV is also indicated for obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
8. Noninvasive PPV is indicated for patients at high risk for reintubation after extubation (e.g., older than age 65 years or with heart failure or COPD).
9. Late application of noninvasive PPV, when indicated, is associated with an increased need for intubation and worse outcomes.
10. Noninvasive PPV can cause harm when needed intubation is delayed or tidal volume is too high.
11. Complications of noninvasive PPV include mucosal dryness, nasal congestion, facial erosions, gastric insufflation, and rarely pulmonary barotrauma.
12. Contraindications to noninvasive PPV include persistent altered mental status, increased airway secretions, emesis, gastric distention, airway obstruction, recent esophageal surgery, cardiac arrest, impaired cough reflex/swallowing, facial trauma or surgery, patient intolerance of the mask, anticipated long-term ventilatory support, and impaired respiratory drive.
13. Proper mask sizing and patient adaptation are essential for effective noninvasive PPV.
14. After initiation, patients on noninvasive PPV should be closely monitored for tolerance, adverse effects, ventilatory effectiveness, and clinical improvement.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
11. Pulmonary barotrauma from noninvasive PPV is rare.
14. Clinical improvement parameters include blood pH, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and mental status.
