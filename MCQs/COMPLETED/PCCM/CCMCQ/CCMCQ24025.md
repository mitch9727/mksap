### 🧠 Neuro: Assessment of Brain Death After Hypothermia

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The 2020 American Heart Association guidelines advise **targeted temperature management** between 32.0 °C (89.6 °F) and 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) for at least 24 hours in patients with coma after cardiac arrest.
2. More recent data question the benefit of **targeted hypothermia** over normothermia with fever prevention.
3. **Hypothermia** may suppress brainstem function and delay the clearance of medications that depress the central nervous system.
4. Patients whose **core body temperature** has been 35.5 °C (95.9 °F) or less should be rewarmed to 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) or greater for at least 24 hours before evaluation for brain death or death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC).
5. Extended duration of therapeutic hypothermia beyond 24 hours after cardiac arrest shows no benefit in neurologic recovery and is not indicated.
6. An **apnea test** is required as part of the BD/DNC evaluation, but it may take place only after the patient has been rewarmed to 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) or greater.
7. **Key Point:** Patients whose core body temperature is 35.5 °C (95.9 °F) or less should be rewarmed to 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) or greater for at least 24 hours before evaluating for brain death or death by neurologic criteria.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Neurologic assessment may be unreliable in patients with a core body temperature below 36.0 °C (96.8 °F).

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. **Coma** describes absent cortical function of the central nervous system with intact brainstem function, caused by illness, trauma, or medication.
2. Patients in a **coma** do not respond to external stimuli.
3. The **Glasgow Coma Scale** assesses severity of deficit based on eye, verbal, and motor responses.
4. **Brainstem findings** such as abnormal pupils or eye movements and **motor findings** such as posturing may help localize central nervous system disease.
5. **Lumbar puncture** and **MRI or CT imaging** are useful in diagnosing the cause of coma.
6. Treatment of coma is supportive, with efforts to reverse the specific cause if possible.
7. In patients with coma after cardiac arrest, the 2020 American Heart Association guidelines advise targeted temperature management between 32.0 °C (89.6 °F) and 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) for at least 24 hours.
8. More recent data show no benefit of targeted hypothermia over normothermia at 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) to 37.5 °C (99.5 °F) with fever prevention.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. The Glasgow Coma Scale evaluates **three categories**: eye response, verbal response, and motor response.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Glasgow Coma Scale)
1. The **Glasgow Coma Scale** evaluates patient response in three domains: eyes, verbal, and motor.
2. The lowest possible total score on the Glasgow Coma Scale is **3**, and the highest is **15**.
3. A Glasgow Coma Scale score of **3 to 8** indicates coma.
4. A Glasgow Coma Scale score of **9 to 12** indicates moderate brain injury.
5. A Glasgow Coma Scale score of **13 to 15** indicates mild brain injury.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. Motor responses on the Glasgow Coma Scale range from no movement (1) to obeying commands (6).
