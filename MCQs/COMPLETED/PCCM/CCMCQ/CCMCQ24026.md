### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Older Critically Ill Patients

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In critically ill older patients with possible **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**, empiric treatment with **ceftriaxone and azithromycin** is appropriate.  
2. **Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** in older patients often presents atypically, with **confusion**, **lethargy**, or **poor oral intake** rather than classic features.  
3. Classic findings of **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** such as **fever**, **cough**, **purulent sputum**, and **leukocytosis** may be absent in older patients.  
4. The sensitivity of **chest radiography** in early detection of **pneumonia** may be as low as **50%**.  
5. A **normal chest radiograph** does not exclude **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**, particularly in **older** or **immunocompromised patients**.  
6. If suspicion for **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** remains high despite a normal chest radiograph, the study may be repeated after **24 hours** or a **CT scan of the chest** may be obtained.  
7. **Timely administration of antibiotics** in **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** is associated with improved outcomes.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The empiric regimen of ceftriaxone plus azithromycin covers both **typical** and **atypical organisms** in CAP.  
2. In this case, empiric antibiotics are the immediate priority over further diagnostic testing, given the patient’s **critical illness**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pneumonia** is a common cause of **respiratory failure** in the ICU.  
2. **Pneumonia** is the most common cause of **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** that develops outside the hospital.  
3. In patients with an appropriate history, **chest radiography** is the standard diagnostic test for **pneumonia**.  
4. A negative **clinical examination** or **chest radiograph** does not necessarily rule out **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** in symptomatic patients, especially **older adults**.  
5. The absence of typical features or focal infiltrates on **chest radiograph** should not preclude early **antibiotic administration** to patients with a high probability of **pneumonia**.  
6. Some guidelines recommend **glucocorticoid administration** in **severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. Extrapulmonary causes of ARDS exist, but **pneumonia** is the leading community-acquired etiology.  
6. Glucocorticoid use in CAP remains **controversial** but is endorsed in some severe cases.
