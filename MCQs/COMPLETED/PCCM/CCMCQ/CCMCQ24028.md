# 🧠 Brain Death: Evaluation and Apnea Test

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Brain death occurs when **no cerebral or brainstem function is evident**, most commonly from anoxic injury, trauma, or intracranial hemorrhage.  
2. The diagnosis of brain death requires: an underlying cause known to cause cerebral insult, coma, absence of cranial nerve reflexes, absence of motor reflexes involving the brain, and lack of respiratory drive.  
3. Confounding factors such as hypothermia, hypotension, severe electrolyte or acid-base disturbances, toxins, or sedative medications must be absent before evaluation for brain death.  
4. In patients with a core body temperature <36.0 °C (96.8 °F), rewarming to ≥36.0 °C and a waiting period of at least 24 hours are required before brain death evaluation.  
5. A detailed neurologic examination with testing of brainstem reflexes is essential, and performing two independent examinations may reduce diagnostic error.  
6. Some spinal reflexes, including finger flexor movements, plantar flexion, myoclonus, and muscle fasciculation, may persist despite brain death.  
7. An **apnea test** (removal of ventilator support) demonstrating absent respiratory drive despite hypercapnia is a **necessary component** of the diagnosis of brain death.  
8. Ancillary tests, such as radionuclide perfusion brain imaging, are used only if there is uncertainty in the diagnosis or if the apnea test cannot be performed (eg, chronic hypercapnia).  
9. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not appropriate for diagnosing brain death because it evaluates only cerebral hemisphere activity and not brainstem function.  
10. U.S. state- and institution-specific criteria may need to be satisfied in addition to clinical and physiologic testing before a patient can be declared brain dead.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Examples of common causes include anoxic injury, trauma, and intracranial hemorrhage.  
2. All required elements (cause, coma, absent brain-mediated reflexes, and absent respiratory drive) must be simultaneously satisfied.  
3. Confounders must be corrected or excluded prior to testing to avoid premature determination.  
4. After rewarming to ≥36.0 °C, an observation period of at least 24 hours is required before evaluation.  
5. Two independent examinations may decrease diagnostic error.  
6. Preservation of spinal reflexes does not imply residual brain or brainstem activity.  
7. The apnea test documents lack of respiratory drive despite hypercapnia after ventilator removal.  
8. Radionuclide perfusion brain imaging is the most commonly used ancillary test when needed.  
9. EEG cannot assess brainstem function and therefore is not appropriate for BD/DNC determination.  
10. Local legal and institutional requirements must be met in addition to clinical criteria.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Brain death is established only when confounding factors are absent or corrected, including hypothermia, hypotension, electrolyte or acid-base derangements, toxins, and sedatives.  
2. If hypothermia is present, patients must be rewarmed to ≥36.0 °C (96.8 °F) and observed for 24 hours before evaluation for brain death.  
3. Ancillary tests such as radionuclide perfusion brain imaging may be used if there is diagnostic uncertainty or inability to perform an apnea test.  
4. U.S. state and institution-specific regulations may impose additional requirements for declaring brain death.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Confounders should be actively corrected (e.g., rewarm hypothermia, treat hypotension, address metabolic derangements, clear sedatives).  
2. Rewarming to ≥36.0 °C and waiting at least 24 hours ensure that hypothermia-related suppression of neurologic function has resolved.  
3. Radionuclide perfusion brain imaging is the most common ancillary study when the apnea test is unsafe or not feasible.  
4. Clinicians must verify hospital policy and state law before formal declaration.
