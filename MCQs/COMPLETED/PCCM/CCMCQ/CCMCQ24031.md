### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: ICU Delirium Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Delirium** is an acute change in cognitive functioning, characterized by **impaired attention** and **disorientation** with **fluctuating mental status**.
2. **Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium** is extremely common and is associated with **increased ICU length of stay**, **mortality**, and **post‑ICU cognitive impairment**.
3. Risk factors for **ICU delirium** include **benzodiazepine use**, **polypharmacy**, **preexisting cognitive impairment**, **older age**, **pre‑ICU surgery or trauma**, and **high severity of illness on ICU admission**.
4. **Early identification and correction of underlying causes** are critical in the management of ICU delirium.
5. **Multicomponent interventions**, such as the **ABCDEF bundle**, decrease delirium duration, reduce ICU length of stay, and improve survival.
6. **Early mobilization** with physical therapy is an effective component of ICU delirium management.
7. For patients requiring ICU sedation, **dexmedetomidine** or **propofol** is preferred; however, dexmedetomidine does **not** treat delirium itself.
8. **Antipsychotics** (for example, **haloperidol** and atypical antipsychotics) have **not** been shown to prevent or treat delirium and may cause **harm**; they should be **avoided** unless severe refractory agitation prevents essential care.
9. **Neuroimaging** (for example, **head CT**) is **not routinely required** in ICU delirium unless a **structural cause** is suspected.

#### 💬 Extra
2. ICU delirium contributes to acute complications (for example, prolonged ventilation) and chronic complications (for example, long‑term cognitive impairment).
5. The **ABCDEF bundle** components are: **Assess, prevent, and manage pain**; **Both spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials**; **Choice of analgesia and sedation**; **Delirium assessment, prevention, and management**; **Early mobility and exercise**; **Family engagement and empowerment**.
8. Pharmacologic sedation may be required only for severe agitation that threatens safety or prevents essential care.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Delirium** is characterized by disturbances in **attention**, **awareness**, and **cognition**, and may include **hypoactive** or **hyperactive** behavioral changes and **emotional disturbances**.
2. Risk factors for **ICU delirium** include **older age**, **pre‑existing dementia**, **previous coma**, **pre‑ICU surgery or trauma**, **high severity of illness on ICU admission**, **exposure to benzodiazepines**, and **blood transfusion**.
3. **Validated screening tools**, including the **Confusion Assessment Method–ICU (CAM‑ICU)** and the **Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)**, facilitate early detection of ICU delirium.
4. **Neuroimaging** is **not routinely required** in the evaluation and management of ICU delirium.
5. No medication has consistently proven effective for preventing or treating delirium, although **melatonin** may help **prevent delirium** in ICU patients.
6. **Antipsychotics** have **no conclusive benefit** in ICU delirium and may cause **harm**.
7. **Benzodiazepines** should **not** be used for delirium management **unless** treating **alcohol withdrawal** or **seizures**.
8. **Multicomponent interventions** like the **ABCDEF bundle** decrease delirium duration, reduce ICU length of stay, improve survival, **lower ICU readmissions**, and **decrease cost of care**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. CAM‑ICU and ICDSC are bedside tools used serially to track delirium.
5. Evidence for melatonin is limited and prevention‑focused rather than therapeutic.
7. Outside alcohol withdrawal and seizures, benzodiazepines can worsen delirium.
