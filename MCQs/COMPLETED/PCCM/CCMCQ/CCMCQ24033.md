### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Point-of-Care Ultrasonography in Undifferentiated Shock

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **hypotension** in acute care settings, **point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)** has **good diagnostic accuracy** in determining the cause when physical examination findings are not helpful.
2. **Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)** allows **immediate integration of diagnostic imaging data into clinical decision making** without the delay of traditional imaging studies.
3. **Hypovolemia**, **pneumothorax**, **right ventricular dysfunction**, **left ventricular dysfunction**, and **cardiac tamponade** can all be diagnosed with **point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)**.
4. In patients with **hypotension** and **probable undifferentiated shock**, **point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)** guides management decisions.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Central venous catheter placement may be required for patients with shock but should not precede POCUS when peripheral access is adequate.
2. Computed tomography (CT) of the head is not the most appropriate next step in a patient with hypotension and undifferentiated shock without focal neurologic findings.
3. Vasopressors such as **norepinephrine** are reserved for patients in shock who remain hypotensive despite **intravenous fluid resuscitation**.

8. The **ROX index** = (**SpO₂/FiO₂** expressed as %) / **respiratory rate** and helps **predict intubation risk** during **HFNC**.
9. **ROX ≥4.88 at 2, 6, and 12 hours** predicts **lower intubation risk**; **ROX <2.85 (2 h), <3.47 (6 h), or <3.85 (12 h)** predicts **HFNC failure**.
10. **Initial HFNC** should be started **in critical care** with **close monitoring** for **tolerance and effectiveness**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Mechanical Ventilatory Support: General Principles
1. **Noninvasive positive‑pressure ventilation (PPV)** types include **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** and **bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)**.
2. **CPAP** provides a **constant pressure** during **inspiration and expiration**.
3. **BPAP** provides **higher inspiratory pressure** than expiratory, **increasing tidal volume**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Invasive Mechanical Ventilation
1. Indications include **hypoxemic** or **hypercapnic respiratory failure** with **contraindications to noninvasive PPV** or **inability to protect the airway**.
2. Ventilator strategy should focus on **lung‑protective ventilation** using the **lowest effective tidal volume and plateau pressure** to avoid **volutrauma** and **atelectrauma**.
3. When risk of lung injury decreases and patients are awake, prioritize **patient‑ventilator synchrony** and **comfort** (e.g., **pressure support** or **synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation**).

#### ✅ True Statements — Weaning off Mechanical Ventilation
1. Patients should be **liberated from ventilation** as soon as feasible.
2. Perform **daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)** for **≥30 minutes and ≤2 hours** using **low pressure support (≤8 cm H₂O)** or a **T‑piece**.
3. Combining **SBTs** with **daily awakening trials** or **light sedation protocols** **reduces ventilation time**, **ICU/hospital length of stay**, and **mortality**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Hemodynamic Support in the ICU

3. **Balanced solutions** with **lower chloride** (e.g., **lactated Ringer**) are generally **preferred** over **0.9% saline** because they **minimize metabolic acidosis** and electrolyte disturbances.
4. Fluid **composition, dose, and duration** should be tailored to **resuscitation**, **replacement**, or **maintenance goals**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Blood Pressure Support in the ICU
1. **Shock** reflects **sustained tissue hypoperfusion** causing **cellular dysfunction** and **death**.
2. **Assessment of perfusion** includes **skin findings**, **capillary refill**, **jugular venous distention**, **vital signs**, and **focused cardiac evaluation**.
3. **Norepinephrine** is the **most used vasopressor** and may **reduce mortality** in some populations, with **other agents** appropriate in **specific scenarios**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Nutritional Support in the ICU
1. **Malnutrition** increases **morbidity and mortality** in critical illness; **all ICU patients** require **nutritional evaluation**.
2. **Enteral nutrition** is **preferred**, with **early initiation (within 24–48 hours)** associated with **lower mortality** and **fewer infections**.
3. Use **gastric or postpyloric tubes** when patients **cannot maintain volitional intake**; **postpyloric feeding** is recommended when **aspiration risk is high**, but **placement delays** should **not delay enteral nutrition**.
4. **Routine gastric residual measurement** is **not recommended**, as it **delays feeding goals**, **clogs access**, and may **increase aspiration risk**.
5. In patients receiving enteral nutrition, **supplemental parenteral nutrition** should be considered **only after 7–10 days** if **<60%** of **energy/protein** needs are met enterally.
6. If **enteral feeding is not possible** and the patient was **adequately nourished**, consider **parenteral nutrition after 7–10 days**.
7. If the patient is **severely malnourished or at high risk** and **enteral feeding is not possible**, **start parenteral nutrition as soon as possible**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Early Mobilization in the ICU
1. **Immobility** contributes to **weakness**, **pressure ulcers**, **osteoporosis**, **gastrointestinal dysmotility**, and **dysautonomia** in critical illness.
2. Even **a few days** of immobility can cause **prolonged weakness**, with **deficits persisting at 1 and 5 years**.
3. **Early mobilization** strategies—including **sedation interruption** and **early physical/occupational therapy**—are associated with **shorter ICU/hospital stays**, **fewer ventilation days**, and **better quality of life and function**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Palliative Care in the ICU: Withdrawal of Life‑Sustaining Therapy
1. After the decision to **discontinue life‑sustaining therapy** consistent with **goals of care**, focus shifts to **symptom‑directed care**.
2. **Analgesia**, **appropriate sedation**, and other **comfort measures** should be provided as needed.
3. **Paralytics**, **vasopressors**, and **inotropes** may be **discontinued stepwise**, followed by **mechanical ventilation** and **artificial airway** as appropriate.
4. **Opioids** treat **pain and dyspnea**; **benzodiazepines** are **preferred** for **additional sedation**; **propofol** or **barbiturates** may also be considered.
5. **Compassionate communication** throughout the ICU stay helps **clarify goals** and involves **family** in **symptom assessment**.
