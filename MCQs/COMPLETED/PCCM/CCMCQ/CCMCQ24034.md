### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Nutritional Support in Critically Ill Patients

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Malnutrition** in critically ill patients leads to **increased morbidity and mortality**.
2. In critically ill patients receiving **mechanical ventilation**, initiating **enteral nutrition within the first 24 to 48 hours** may be associated with **lower infection risk**, **less time on the ventilator**, **decreased ICU and hospital lengths of stay**, and **decreased hospital mortality**.
3. Benefits of **early enteral nutrition** extend beyond prevention of malnutrition and include **reduced inflammatory response in the gut and lung**, **reduced gut permeability**, **preserved gastrointestinal motility**, and **preservation of commensal gastrointestinal flora**.
4. **Simple gastric feeding** is adequate in most critically ill patients.
5. **Postpyloric feeding** is reserved for patients who **cannot tolerate gastric feeding** or are at **high risk for aspiration**.
6. **Metoclopramide**, a prokinetic agent, may improve enteral nutrition tolerance but **does not improve patient outcomes** and may cause **diarrhea** or **QT interval prolongation**.
7. Guidelines recommend **against routine measurement of gastric residual volume (GRV)** because GRV does **not correlate** with pneumonia, reflux, or aspiration and may cause unnecessary interruptions in enteral nutrition delivery.
8. **Parenteral nutrition** should not be started immediately in patients tolerating enteral feeds. It should only be considered if patients receive **<60% of energy and protein needs** via enteral nutrition for **7 to 10 days**.
9. **Early parenteral nutrition** should be considered in **severely malnourished** patients and those at **high risk of malnutrition** who cannot receive enteral nutrition.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Benefits are based on outcomes data in critically ill, mechanically ventilated populations.
6. Clarifies why metoclopramide was not indicated in the scenario.
8–9. Summarizes guideline recommendations for timing and indications for parenteral nutrition.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients in the **ICU** should undergo a **nutritional evaluation**.
2. **Enteral nutrition** is preferred unless a **contraindication** exists (e.g., **gastrointestinal perforation** or **hemorrhage**).
3. **Early enteral nutrition** is associated with decreased **mortality** and **infections** and should be initiated within **24 to 48 hours of admission** whenever possible.
4. Critically ill patients unable to maintain volitional intake should be fed using a **gastric or postpyloric tube**.
5. **Postpyloric feeding** is recommended for patients at **high risk of aspiration**, but delays in tube placement should not delay enteral nutrition initiation.
6. **Routine gastric residual volume (GRV) measurement** is not recommended because it delays achievement of feeding goals, increases enteral tube clogging risk, and may increase aspiration risk.
7. In patients receiving enteral nutrition, **supplemental parenteral nutrition** should be considered only after **7 to 10 days** of receiving **<60% of energy and protein requirements** by enteral feeding.
8. Adding **parenteral nutrition** earlier than this may cause **harm**.
9. In patients unable to receive enteral feeding and with **adequate baseline nutrition**, **parenteral nutrition** should be initiated after **7 to 10 days**.
10. In patients who are **severely malnourished** or at **high risk for malnutrition** and cannot receive enteral feeding, **parenteral nutrition** should be initiated as soon as possible.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Nutritional assessment is emphasized as universal in ICU care.
5. Clarifies timing—do not wait for postpyloric access to start enteral nutrition.
7–10. Distinguish supplemental PN in partially fed patients vs primary PN in those unable to receive any enteral nutrition.
