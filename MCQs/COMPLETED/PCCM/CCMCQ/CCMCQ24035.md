### 🧠 Critical Care Medicine: Preventing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) and High-Value ICU Care

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Removal of **indwelling urinary catheters** without a clear, ongoing indication reduces the risk of **catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)**; the **duration of catheterization** is the primary modifiable risk factor.
2. **Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)** is the most common **device-associated, health care–associated infection** in the United States, and **up to 70%** of CAUTI episodes are preventable.
3. The **Choosing Wisely** campaign recommends **removing unnecessary catheters and drains** in critically ill patients to avoid waste and harm.
4. Early **mobilization** of critically ill patients is important once clinically feasible.
5. For **community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**, a **5-day** antibiotic course is sufficient for most patients who achieve **clinical stability** by 72 hours; **longer durations** are recommended for **meningitis**, **endocarditis**, other **deep-seated infections**, or infections with **Burkholderia pseudomallei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,** or **endemic fungi**.
6. In **improving adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**, guidelines recommend **against routine follow-up chest imaging**.
7. In **acute hypoxic respiratory failure** with **bilateral lung infiltrates**, **transthoracic echocardiography** helps assess the likelihood of **left-sided heart failure** and is **necessary** when **endocarditis** is clinically suspected.
8. In critically ill patients, **all catheters and drains** without an ongoing indication should be **removed as soon as feasible**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. Clinical stability in CAP generally includes normalizing vital signs, improving oxygenation, and the ability to maintain oral intake; this contextualizes why many patients can stop antibiotics by day 5 when improving.
7. Echocardiography can clarify cardiogenic versus noncardiogenic causes of bilateral infiltrates when the etiology is uncertain.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. High-value care is defined as care that **balances clinical benefit with cost and harm** to improve patient outcomes.
2. The **ICU** is a setting where high-value strategies can have **major effects** because resources are **expensive** and the culture often **favors aggressive resource use**.
3. Internal medicine and critical care societies joined the **American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation** in the **Choosing Wisely** campaign to promote **cost-effective strategies** that improve patient care and **avoid waste and harm**.
