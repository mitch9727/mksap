### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Low Tidal Volume Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Predicted body weight (PBW)** in men is calculated as **50 + 2.3 × (height in inches − 60)**.  
2. **Predicted body weight (PBW)** in women is calculated as **45.5 + 2.3 × (height in inches − 60)**.  
3. **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** is characterized by **diffuse alveolar damage** with **fluid and protein extravasation into interstitial and alveolar spaces**, **microatelectasis**, **increased ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch**, **decreased lung compliance**, and **increased shunt and dead-space ventilation**.  
4. In **ARDS**, areas of **noncompliant, diseased lung** are often adjacent to **compliant lung**, so **high tidal volumes** can lead to **overdistention and ventilator-associated lung injury (volutrauma)**.  
5. Patients with **ARDS** should receive **low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV)** with a tidal volume of **4 to 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW)**.  
6. In **ARDS**, ventilator strategies should **minimize plateau pressure (<30 cm H₂O)**.  
7. **Survival is improved** when patients with **ARDS** are ventilated with a tidal volume of **6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW)**.  
8. Using **actual body weight** in patients who are **overweight or edematous** will typically result in **inappropriately large tidal volumes**.  
9. **Tidal volumes that are too low** (for example, 150 mL in a woman with PBW 50 kg) can cause **alveolar collapse, worsened ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and hypercapnia**.  
10. **Tidal volumes that are too high** (for example, 500–700 mL in a woman with PBW 50 kg) increase the risk of **ventilator-induced lung injury** and **worse outcomes**.  
11. If ventilation is insufficient using **low tidal volume ventilation**, measures other than increasing tidal volume should be considered, such as **increasing respiratory rate**.  
12. In **ARDS**, **adequate sedation** improves patient tolerance of mechanical ventilation.  
13. In **ARDS**, **prone positioning** improves **ventilation/perfusion mismatch**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. PBW equations are standardized formulas and are used instead of actual weight for ventilator settings.  
5. The 4–8 mL/kg PBW range defines low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV).  
7. The **ARDS Network trial** established improved survival at 6 mL/kg PBW tidal volume.  
13. Prone positioning redistributes perfusion and ventilation, enhancing oxygenation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Most patients with **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** are managed with **invasive mechanical ventilation**.  
2. The cornerstones of **ARDS management** are **low tidal volume ventilation** and **positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**, both associated with **improved outcomes**.  
3. In **ARDS**, the lung injury is **heterogeneous**, with areas of **low compliance** adjacent to areas of **normal compliance**, predisposing the latter to **volutrauma**, which is mitigated by **low tidal volume ventilation**.  
4. Evidence shows an **11% absolute mortality reduction** with **tidal volume 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight** and **plateau pressure <30 cm H₂O** in **ARDS**.  
5. **Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)** prevents **atelectrauma** from repeated opening and closing of alveoli and improves **V/Q mismatch** by maintaining alveolar recruitment.  
6. No universal **optimal PEEP** level is established for **ARDS**.  
7. The **PEEP-Fio₂ table** is the favored method to select PEEP, targeting oxygen saturation of **88–95%**.  
8. Guidelines **conditionally recommend higher PEEP** (but not recruitment maneuvers) in **moderate to severe ARDS**.  
9. **Prone positioning** reduces **posterior lung compression** and improves **ventilation/perfusion matching** in **ARDS**.  
10. A randomized trial showed **mortality benefit** from **early prone positioning (within 48 h)** in **severe ARDS (PaO₂/Fio₂ <150 mm Hg and Fio₂ ≥0.6)** when combined with **low tidal volume ventilation**.  
11. In **severe ARDS**, **prone positioning** should be applied for at least **12–16 hours per day**.  
12. **Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)** is a therapeutic option for **ARDS** unresponsive to conventional management, and early evaluation for ECMO appropriateness is recommended in **severe ARDS**.  
13. Other ventilator methods—**inverse ratio ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, esophageal pressure monitoring, driving pressure-guided titration of PEEP, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation**—have **not demonstrated mortality benefit** in **ARDS**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Both LTVV and PEEP reduce mechanical injury and improve survival in ARDS.  
5. PEEP improves lung homogeneity by reducing differences in regional compliance.  
7. The PEEP-Fio₂ table aligns PEEP with oxygen needs rather than a fixed setting.  
10. Mortality benefit of prone positioning was strongest in severe ARDS patients with PaO₂/Fio₂ <150.  
12. ECMO is not first-line but is considered when conventional ventilation strategies fail.
