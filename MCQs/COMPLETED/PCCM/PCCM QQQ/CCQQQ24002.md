### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Prone Positioning in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**, **low tidal volume ventilation** (4–8 mL/kg ideal body weight) is recommended.  
2. The **PROSEVA trial** showed that **prone positioning** in ARDS patients with an **arterial Po₂/Fio₂ ratio <150 mm Hg** despite ventilator support resulted in a **16.2% reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality** compared with conventional therapy.  
3. The **2017 ATS/ESICM/SCCM guideline**, updated in 2023 by the **European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM)**, recommends **early initiation of prone positioning** after intubation in patients with ARDS who are on invasive mechanical ventilation and have a **Po₂/Fio₂ ratio <150 mm Hg despite optimized ventilator settings**.  
4. **Prone positioning sessions** for ARDS should be **prolonged (≥16 consecutive hours)** to reduce mortality.  
5. The **2023 ESICM guideline** recommends **against high-pressure recruitment maneuvers** (airway pressure ≥35 cm H₂O) of any duration in ARDS because they do not reduce mortality.  
6. **Inhaled nitric oxide (NO)** in ARDS may improve oxygenation but has **no survival benefit** and is not the preferred treatment.  
7. **High-frequency oscillatory ventilation** has been shown to be **no different or harmful** compared with low tidal volume ventilation in ARDS and is **strongly not recommended** by ATS/ESICM/SCCM guidelines.  
8. Both **low tidal volume ventilation** and **prone positioning** demonstrate a **mortality benefit** in patients with ARDS.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. The PROSEVA trial enrolled patients within 36 hours of ARDS onset, showing the importance of early prone positioning.  
5. Recruitment maneuvers can transiently improve oxygenation but increase barotrauma risk.  
7. Two large randomized trials in 2013 demonstrated harm or lack of benefit with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Most patients with **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** are managed with **invasive mechanical ventilation**.  
2. The cornerstones of **ARDS management** are **low tidal volume ventilation** and **positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**, both associated with **improved outcomes**.  
3. In **ARDS**, the lung injury is **heterogeneous**, with areas of **low compliance** adjacent to areas of **normal compliance**, predisposing the latter to **volutrauma**, which is mitigated by **low tidal volume ventilation**.  
4. Evidence shows an **11% absolute mortality reduction** with **tidal volume 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight** and **plateau pressure <30 cm H₂O** in **ARDS**.  
5. **Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)** prevents **atelectrauma** from repeated opening and closing of alveoli and improves **V/Q mismatch** by maintaining alveolar recruitment.  
6. No universal **optimal PEEP** level is established for **ARDS**.  
7. The **PEEP-Fio₂ table** is the favored method to select PEEP, targeting oxygen saturation of **88–95%**.  
8. Guidelines **conditionally recommend higher PEEP** (but not recruitment maneuvers) in **moderate to severe ARDS**.  
9. **Prone positioning** reduces **posterior lung compression** and improves **ventilation/perfusion matching** in **ARDS**.  
10. A randomized trial showed **mortality benefit** from **early prone positioning (within 48 h)** in **severe ARDS (PaO₂/Fio₂ <150 mm Hg and Fio₂ ≥0.6)** when combined with **low tidal volume ventilation**.  
11. In **severe ARDS**, **prone positioning** should be applied for at least **12–16 hours per day**.  
12. **Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)** is a therapeutic option for **ARDS** unresponsive to conventional management, and early evaluation for ECMO appropriateness is recommended in **severe ARDS**.  
13. Other ventilator methods—**inverse ratio ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, esophageal pressure monitoring, driving pressure-guided titration of PEEP, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation**—have **not demonstrated mortality benefit** in **ARDS**.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. Both LTVV and PEEP reduce mechanical injury and improve survival in ARDS.  
5. PEEP improves lung homogeneity by reducing differences in regional compliance.  
7. The PEEP-Fio₂ table aligns PEEP with oxygen needs rather than a fixed setting.  
10. Mortality benefit of prone positioning was strongest in severe ARDS patients with PaO₂/Fio₂ <150.  
12. ECMO is not first-line but is considered when conventional ventilation strategies fail.
