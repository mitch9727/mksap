### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Noninvasive Ventilation in Neuromuscular Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** ventilation improves **survival** and **quality of life** in patients with **neuromuscular disease**.
2. **BPAP** delivers both **inspiratory positive airway pressure** and **expiratory positive airway pressure**, generating a pressure difference that augments respiratory muscle activity and increases breath size.
3. The use of **BPAP** decreases **arterial carbon dioxide (Pco₂)** levels by increasing **minute ventilation** and improving **efficiency of breathing**.
4. **Invasive mechanical ventilation** is indicated for **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** in neuromuscular disease if patients do not benefit from or cannot tolerate noninvasive ventilation, or have **decreasing bulbar function**, **frequent aspiration**, **insufficient cough**, or **chest infections despite adequate secretion management**.
5. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** is not effective for **hypercapnic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disorders**, as it does not augment ventilation.
6. **Oxygen therapy alone** should be avoided in patients with **neuromuscular disease and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure**, as it can worsen **hypercapnia**.
7. A **normal alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient** with **hypercapnia** indicates hypoxemia is due to **hypoventilation**, not ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Orthopnea is a characteristic symptom of **chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure** due to neuromuscular disease.
4. Invasive mechanical ventilation may be delivered via **endotracheal intubation** or **tracheostomy**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Indications and Patient Selection
1. Evidence supports use of **noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (PPV)** in **acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, **cardiogenic pulmonary edema**, **neuromuscular disease**, and **obesity hypoventilation syndrome**.
2. **Noninvasive PPV** is indicated in patients being **extubated** who are at **high risk for reintubation**, including those aged **>65 years**, or with **heart failure** or **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
3. **Late application** of noninvasive PPV, when otherwise indicated, is associated with **increased need for intubation** and **worse outcomes**.
4. **Delaying intubation** when required, or allowing **excessively high tidal volumes** with noninvasive PPV, can cause **patient harm**.
5. Complications of noninvasive PPV include **mucosal dryness**, **nasal congestion**, **facial erosions**, **gastric insufflation**, and, rarely, **pulmonary barotrauma**.
6. Contraindications to **noninvasive PPV** due to **airway protection failure** include **persistent altered mental status**, **impaired cough reflex or swallowing** (inability to protect the airway), and **airway obstruction**.
7. Contraindications to **noninvasive PPV** due to **gastrointestinal issues** include **emesis**, **gastric distention**, and **recent esophageal surgery**.
8. Contraindications to **noninvasive PPV** due to **acute instability** include **cardiac arrest** and **impaired respiratory drive**.
9. Contraindications to **noninvasive PPV** due to **mask/interface limitations** include **facial trauma or surgery** (oral, nasal, or sinus) and **patient intolerance of the mask**.
10. An **anticipated long-term need for ventilatory support** is a contraindication to **noninvasive PPV**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Noninvasive PPV** is most effective in reversible causes of respiratory failure such as COPD exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
5. **Facial mask complications** arise from prolonged tight contact and high pressures.
