### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Initial Fluid Resuscitation in Septic Shock

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial treatment of **septic shock** should focus on **aggressive fluid resuscitation** with **30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluids** within the first **3 hours** of resuscitation.  
2. **Crystalloid fluids** such as **0.9% saline** or **lactated Ringer solution** are recommended as first-line resuscitative therapy in **septic or distributive shock**.  
3. **Judicious fluid administration** is required after the initial bolus, because **volume overload** can contribute to **pulmonary edema** and **pleural effusions**.  
4. If **hypotension** does not rapidly correct with fluids, **vasopressors** should be titrated to maintain a **mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mm Hg**.  
5. **Norepinephrine** is considered the **first-line vasopressor** in septic shock.  
6. **Erythrocyte transfusion** is recommended in **septic shock** only if the **hemoglobin level is <7 g/dL (70 g/L)**, unless extenuating circumstances exist (myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or active hemorrhage).

#### 💬 Extra
1. This patient had septic shock features including **fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated leukocyte count, elevated lactate**, and recent **influenza infection**.  
2. **Furosemide** is inappropriate in septic shock because it worsens hypotension; it is used in **cardiogenic shock with volume overload**.  
4. In patients with **chronic hypertension**, higher MAP targets may be considered to reduce risk of kidney replacement therapy.  
6. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend **restrictive transfusion strategy** unless additional high-risk features are present.

#### ✅ True Statements — Initial Resuscitation
1. **Sepsis** causes **decreased preload** (from capillary leak), **impaired cardiac contractility**, and **decreased vascular tone**, leading to **hemodynamic compromise**.  
2. The **Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines** recommend an **initial bolus of 30 mL/kg crystalloid fluid** within the **first 3 hours** of resuscitation for **sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock**.  
3. The **1-hour bundle** indicates that a **fluid bolus** should be **initiated within the first hour** of presentation.  
4. **Crystalloid solutions** are preferred over **colloid albumin** because of **lower cost** and **lack of proven additional benefit**.  
5. Adequacy of fluid resuscitation and the need for further fluids or vasopressors should be assessed using **dynamic measures**, such as the **passive leg raise test**.  
6. When **hypotension persists** after an initial **30 mL/kg bolus**, **additional fluids** can be considered if the patient remains **fluid responsive**.  
7. A **mean arterial pressure of 60–65 mm Hg** is generally targeted during initial resuscitation.  
8. In patients with **chronic hypertension**, **higher MAP targets** may reduce the risk of **requiring kidney replacement therapy**.  
9. **Norepinephrine** is the **first-line vasopressor** for **septic shock** because it **increases systemic vascular resistance** without compromising **myocardial performance**.  
10. If **norepinephrine alone is insufficient**, **vasopressin** can be added, and **epinephrine** may be used for persistent shock despite combined norepinephrine and vasopressin therapy.  
11. In **septic shock with concomitant cardiogenic features**, **dobutamine** may be added for inotropic support.  
12. **Epinephrine alone** is also reasonable for vasopressor support in refractory cases.  
13. **Dopamine** is associated with **increased tachyarrhythmia** and **higher mortality** compared with norepinephrine and is not recommended except in patients with **clinically significant bradycardia**.  
14. In patients with **elevated lactate >2 mmol/L**, levels should be **rechecked within 2–4 hours** to ensure improvement.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Both the **30 mL/kg guideline** and the **1-hour bundle** emphasize urgency in initial fluid resuscitation.  
5. **Passive leg raise** temporarily increases venous return and helps determine fluid responsiveness.  
10. **Vasopressin** is usually added at fixed low doses to spare norepinephrine and improve vascular tone.  
13. **Dopamine** remains an option only in cases of septic shock with profound bradycardia when norepinephrine may worsen slow heart rate.

#### ✅ True Statements — Selection of Vasopressors and Inotropes
1. **Angiotensin II** is used for **distributive shock**, targets the **angiotensin II (AT II) receptor**, primarily **increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR)**, and its **role is still being defined**.  
2. **Dobutamine (inotrope)** treats **cardiogenic shock** and **distributive shock**, targets **β₁ and β₂ receptors**, primarily **increases inotropy**, and is the **first choice for cardiogenic shock without hypotension**.  
3. **Dobutamine** may be **added to norepinephrine** for **septic shock with depressed cardiac function**.  
4. **Milrinone (inotrope)** treats **cardiogenic shock**, targets **phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibition**, **increases inotropy**, and is an **alternative agent** in **cardiogenic shock refractory** to other agents.  
5. **High-dose dopamine** treats **cardiogenic shock**, targets **dopamine (D), α₁, and β₁ receptors**, **increases SVR and inotropy**, and is **associated with increased mortality compared with norepinephrine** in distributive shock; it should be used **only in cases of severe bradycardia in septic shock**.  
6. **Low-dose dopamine** (dopamine, β₁ activity) is **not recommended to augment renal blood flow**.  
7. **Epinephrine** treats **cardiogenic, distributive, and hypovolemic shock**, targets **α₁, α₂, β₁, and β₂ receptors**, **increases SVR and inotropy**, and is the **first choice for anaphylactic (distributive) shock**.  
8. **Epinephrine** may be **added to norepinephrine and vasopressin** in **persistent septic (distributive) shock**, and **may be used as a single agent** in **septic shock with depressed cardiac function**.  
9. **Norepinephrine** treats **cardiogenic, distributive, and hypovolemic shock**, targets **α₁, α₂, and β₁ receptors**, **increases SVR and inotropy**, and is the **first-choice agent** in these shock states.  
10. **Phenylephrine** (α₁ agonist) is an **alternative agent** for **distributive shock** when **tachyarrhythmias preclude use of first-line agents**.  
11. **Vasopressin** treats **distributive and hypovolemic shock**, targets the **vasopressin (V) receptor**, **increases SVR**, **may be added to norepinephrine** in **persistent septic (distributive) shock**, and has **no role in other shock states**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **AT II** = angiotensin type II; the table notes its **evolving role** rather than a definitive placement in algorithms.  
5. The table’s warning on **high-dose dopamine** aligns with observed **mortality and tachyarrhythmia risks** in distributive shock.  
6. “**Renal-dose dopamine**” is discouraged—no benefit in renal perfusion is shown in the table note.  
9. Although **norepinephrine** appears across multiple shock types in the table, your main section already emphasizes it as **first-line in septic shock**; this row extends its applicability per the table.  
11. The table explicitly limits **vasopressin** to an **adjunct role in septic shock**, with **no role** in other shock states.
