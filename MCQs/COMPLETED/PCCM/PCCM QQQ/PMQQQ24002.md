### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Diagnosis of Bronchiectasis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchiectasis** should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with a **chronic cough**, especially if there is a history of **frequent respiratory infections** or if the cough is **productive**.  
2. Additional symptoms of **bronchiectasis** include **hemoptysis**, **wheezing**, and **dyspnea**.  
3. Physical examination in **bronchiectasis** may reveal **clubbing**, **crackles**, and/or **wheezing**.  
4. **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)** in **bronchiectasis** often demonstrate **mild to moderate fixed airflow obstruction**.  
5. **Chest radiography** in **bronchiectasis** may show **linear atelectasis** or **dilated and thickened airways** (seen as **“tram” or “parallel” lines**).  
6. **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest** is the **gold standard diagnostic test** for **bronchiectasis**.  
7. Diagnostic criteria for **bronchiectasis on HRCT** include an **airway diameter greater than the accompanying vessel** and **lack of distal airway tapering**.  
8. **Bronchial wall thickening**, **mucus impaction**, and **cysts** may also be present on **HRCT** in **bronchiectasis**.  
9. Previous **sputum cultures** with uncommon pathogens such as **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**, **Aspergillus**, or **nontuberculous mycobacteria** may be a clue to **bronchiectasis**.  
10. Evaluation for **underlying causes** of **bronchiectasis** should always be performed, though up to **40% of cases are idiopathic**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Bronchoscopy is useful when there is concern for **mass, focal obstruction, or foreign body**, not for routine diagnosis.  
2. **Bronchoalveolar lavage** is considered only if **sputum cultures are negative** but an **infectious etiology** is still suspected.  
3. **Chest MRI** has a very limited role in **bronchiectasis diagnosis** and is generally **not indicated**.  
4. **Sweat chloride testing** is the **initial test for cystic fibrosis (CF)** and should be considered only if **bronchiectasis is confirmed**, especially with **upper lobe distribution**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial evaluation for **bronchiectasis** should include a comprehensive medical history, including **childhood diseases** and **family history**, and careful exclusion of known causes.  
2. **Bronchiectasis** is diagnosed by **high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** of the chest.  
3. Diagnostic criteria for **bronchiectasis** on **HRCT** include an **airway diameter greater than that of its accompanying vessel** and **lack of distal airway tapering**.  
4. **Bronchial wall thickening** or **cysts** may be present on **HRCT** in **bronchiectasis**.  
5. Every patient diagnosed with **bronchiectasis** requires evaluation for a **treatable underlying cause**.  
6. Evaluation for underlying causes of **bronchiectasis** may involve testing for **chronic bacterial** or **mycobacterial infections** to identify potential causes of disease progression and to help determine targeted antimicrobial therapy for exacerbations.  
7. Patients with **bronchiectasis** should be evaluated for the presence of **connective tissue disease** and **immune dysfunction**, including **immunoglobulin deficiencies**.  
8. In select patients with **bronchiectasis**, testing for **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, **ciliary dysfunction**, or **α1-antitrypsin deficiency** may be appropriate.  
9. Even with rigorous evaluation, more than **50% of bronchiectasis cases** are labeled **idiopathic**.  

#### 💬 Extra
3. The hallmark CT features—bronchus larger than adjacent artery and absent tapering—are demonstrated in the supplemental figure.
