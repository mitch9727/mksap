### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Bronchial Carcinoid Tumor

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchial carcinoid tumors** represent only a **small percentage of all lung cancers**, but they are one of the **most common lung cancers in younger patients**.
2. Most **bronchial carcinoid tumors** involve the **proximal airways**, where they can cause **endobronchial narrowing or obstruction**.
3. **Postobstructive pneumonia** may occur in patients with **bronchial carcinoid tumors** due to airway obstruction.
4. Up to **8% of patients with bronchial carcinoid tumors** present with **carcinoid syndrome**, which includes **episodic flushing, diarrhea, and right-sided valvular heart lesions**.
5. **Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)** accounts for **15% to 20% of lung cancer cases** and is **almost exclusively caused by smoking**.
6. Most patients with **small cell lung cancer (SCLC)** have **metastatic disease** at the time of diagnosis.
7. **Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations** are abnormal **communications between pulmonary arteries and veins** and may cause **dyspnea, hypoxemia, hemoptysis, or platypnea**.
8. Most **pulmonary arteriovenous malformations** are associated with **hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Persistent pulmonary infiltrates with a localized wheeze should raise concern for **postobstructive pneumonia**, which suggests an obstructing airway lesion such as a carcinoid tumor.
5–6. **Small cell lung cancer** is unlikely in a **27-year-old nonsmoker**.
7–8. Unlike carcinoid tumors, **pulmonary arteriovenous malformations** do not present as **endobronchial tumors** causing localized wheezing and recurrent infections.

#### ✅ True Statements — Other Pulmonary Neoplasms
1. **Carcinoid tumors** are **low-grade neoplasms** comprised of **neuroendocrine cells** and account for **1% to 2% of all lung cancers**.
2. **Smoking** is not clearly a **risk factor** for **carcinoid tumors**.
3. **Carcinoid tumors** arise in the **proximal airways** and most often cause symptoms of an **obstructing mass** such as **cough, dyspnea, or monophonic wheezing**, or symptoms of **bleeding**.
4. **Bronchial obstruction** due to **carcinoid tumors** may cause **lobar atelectasis** and **recurrent pneumonia** in the same pulmonary segment or lobe.
5. **Carcinoid tumors** may initially be misdiagnosed as **asthma** or **pneumonia**, leading to a **delay in diagnosis**.
6. **Lung carcinoid tumors** are rarely associated with **carcinoid syndrome**.
7. **Surgical resection** of **carcinoid tumors** is often **curative**, with **10-year survival rates exceeding 90%**.
8. **Adenoid cystic carcinoma** is a **salivary gland tumor** that occurs in the **lower respiratory tract** and accounts for **<1% of all lung cancers**.
9. **Surgical resection** is the **preferred treatment** for **adenoid cystic carcinoma**.
10. **Hamartomas** are the **most common benign lung neoplasms** and are composed of **cartilage, connective tissue, smooth muscle, fat, and respiratory epithelium**.
11. On imaging, **hamartomas** often appear as **smooth-bordered nodules** that may demonstrate **“popcorn” calcification** or contain **fat**.
12. The **lung** is a frequent site of **metastatic disease** from other cancers, including **head and neck, colon, kidney, breast, thyroid, and melanoma**.
13. **Metastatic lung disease** can present as **solitary or multiple nodules**, **lymphangitic spread**, or as **endobronchial, pleural, or embolic lesions**.
14. **Surgical resection** may be appropriate for a **solitary pulmonary metastasis** if there is **no evidence of other metastatic disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. The predominant clinical manifestations of **carcinoid tumors** are due to their **endobronchial location**.
7. Long-term survival following **surgical resection of carcinoid tumors** is favorable compared with most other lung cancers.
10. **Hamartomas** are rare compared to malignant lung tumors but remain the most common **benign** neoplasm.
12. The wide variety of primary cancers that metastasize to the lung underscores the importance of considering **secondary malignancy** in lung nodules.
