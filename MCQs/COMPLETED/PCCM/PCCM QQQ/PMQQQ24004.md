### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **pneumothorax** is considered **large** when the **lung margin** is **greater than 2 cm** from the **chest wall**.  
2. **Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)** occurs in the **absence of underlying predisposing disease** such as **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.  
3. Risk factors for **primary spontaneous pneumothorax** include **subpleural blebs**, **tall stature**, **genetic predisposition**, and **smoking**.  
4. In patients with **pneumothorax**, **supplemental oxygen** is provided to promote **absorption of nitrogen-rich pleural air**.  
5. Management of **primary spontaneous pneumothorax** is driven by **clinical symptoms**.  
6. For **primary spontaneous pneumothorax** with **breathlessness** and **chest pain**, **facilitation of lung re-expansion** is indicated with **insertion of a small-bore (<14 Fr [4.7 mm]) thoracostomy tube** connected to a **high-volume, low-pressure suction system**.  
7. **Needle aspiration** may be considered before **thoracostomy tube insertion**, but it has a **lower initial success rate** than **thoracostomy tube insertion**.  
8. **Small-bore thoracostomy tubes** are as effective as **large-bore thoracostomy tubes** and are associated with **lower complication rates**, **shorter treatment duration**, and **shorter hospital stay**.  
9. **Observation with overnight monitoring and repeat chest radiography** may be appropriate for **small (<2 cm) primary spontaneous pneumothorax** without significant or only minimal symptoms.  
10. **Pleurodesis** is recommended for **recurrence prevention** after the **second episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax** on the same side or after the **first occurrence of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax**.  

#### 💬 Extra
6. In a **clinically unstable** patient with **primary spontaneous pneumothorax**, **emergent needle aspiration** is appropriate before tube placement.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Clinical symptoms** drive the **management of pneumothorax**.  
2. **Tension pneumothorax** (large and hemodynamically compromising) should be treated with **emergent needle thoracostomy** followed by **thoracostomy tube placement** and **hospitalization**.  
3. **Observation alone** is safe for **small** and **moderate to large pneumothoraces** in otherwise **healthy patients with minimal symptoms**.  
4. **Smoking cessation** should be encouraged in patients with **primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)**, because the **lifetime incidence** is much higher in **lifelong heavy smokers (12%)** compared with **never-smokers (0.1%)**.  
5. **Recurrence prevention** is recommended after the **second episode of PSP** on the **ipsilateral side** or after the **first occurrence of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP)**.  
6. Interventions to prevent recurrence of **spontaneous pneumothorax** include **chemical pleurodesis** and **mechanical pleurodesis**.  
7. **Endobronchial valves** and **autologous blood patches** are considered **second-line therapies** when a **persistent air leak** is present.  
8. Patients should avoid **air travel** until the **pneumothorax completely resolves**.  
9. **Scuba diving** is generally **not recommended** after a **spontaneous pneumothorax**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The emphasis on symptoms aligns with the BTS pleural guideline, which prioritizes clinical stability over size alone.  
4. Smoking markedly increases the risk of recurrence of **primary spontaneous pneumothorax**.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Management of Pneumothorax Based on Size and Clinical Symptoms)
1. Patients with **minimal symptoms** and **clinical stability**, regardless of pneumothorax size, should be managed with **hospitalization for observation** and **supplemental oxygen**.  
2. **Outpatient management** of **primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)** may be considered if there is **good access to medical care**.  
3. For a pneumothorax **greater than 2 cm on chest radiograph** or with **significant symptoms** (such as **dyspnea** or **chest pain**), management options include **needle aspiration**, **insertion of an ambulatory device**, or **insertion of a small-bore (<14 Fr [4.7 mm]) thoracostomy tube** with connection to a **high-volume, low-pressure suction system**.  
4. Patients with **cardiovascular compromise** (such as **hypotension** or **increasing breathlessness**) should undergo **emergent needle decompression** followed by **thoracostomy tube insertion**.  
5. If there is a **persistent air leak lasting longer than 48 hours**, referral to an **interventional pulmonologist** or **thoracic surgeon** is recommended.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Supplemental oxygen increases the gradient for nitrogen absorption, accelerating resolution of pleural air.  
3. The threshold of **>2 cm** is measured between the **lung and chest wall** at the **level of the hilum**.
