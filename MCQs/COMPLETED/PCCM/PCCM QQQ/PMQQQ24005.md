### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Severe Asthma Exacerbation Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Systemic glucocorticoids**, such as **intravenous methylprednisolone**, are indicated in the management of a **severe asthma exacerbation** requiring hospitalization.  
2. Patients with **asthma exacerbations** and risk factors for **asthma-related death** (such as prior intubation, multiple recent exacerbations, and poor adherence to controller therapy) should be **hospitalized**.  
3. Clinical findings of **tachycardia**, **hypoxemia**, **increased work of breathing**, and **decreased air movement** on chest examination suggest **severe airflow obstruction** and risk for **impending respiratory failure**.  
4. **Hospital management** of severe asthma exacerbation includes **close monitoring** of dyspnea, work of breathing, and vital signs; **frequent bronchodilator therapy**; and **systemic glucocorticoids**.  
5. **Pulse oximetry** can be **falsely reassuring** in asthma exacerbations because **oxygen saturation may remain normal despite high work of breathing**.  
6. **Hypoxemia** is a **late sign** of impending **respiratory failure** in asthma exacerbations.  
7. In **high-risk asthma exacerbations** or in those not improving with initial therapy, **arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis** is vital and should initially reveal **hyperventilation with low arterial Pco₂**.  
8. **Normalization of arterial Pco₂** in asthma exacerbation can be an **early indicator of respiratory muscle fatigue** and **impending respiratory arrest**.  
9. **Outpatient therapy** with **prednisone** or **budesonide–formoterol inhaler** is not appropriate for patients with **severe asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization**.  
10. Patients with **severe signs during an asthma exacerbation** should be **hospitalized**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Hospitalization is favored in this context because of the **risk factors for asthma-related death** and the **severity of examination findings**.  
5–6. Reliance on **oxygen saturation alone** may delay recognition of **respiratory decline**.  
7–8. ABG changes provide **early physiologic markers** of deterioration that may not be apparent on physical exam or pulse oximetry.

#### ✅ True Statements — Management of Asthma Exacerbations
1. An **asthma exacerbation** is defined as an **acute worsening of symptoms or lung function from baseline** that requires a **step-up in therapy**.  
2. **Prompt recognition and treatment** of asthma exacerbations are needed to **relieve symptoms** and **prevent hospitalizations**.  
3. All patients with asthma should have a **written asthma management plan** to help them **recognize exacerbations** and begin **self-treatment**.  
4. **Self-treatment** of asthma exacerbation includes:  
   - Frequent use of **reliever medications**
   - Increased **dose or frequency of controller medications**
   - A **short course of oral glucocorticoids** (typically **prednisone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days**)
5. Patients who **do not improve with self-treatment** or who show **signs of severe attack** should be evaluated in an **acute care facility**.  
6. **Acute care management** of severe asthma exacerbation includes:  
   - **Close monitoring** of dyspnea, work of breathing, and vital signs  
   - **Frequent inhaled short-acting β₂-agonist (SABA) administration**
   - **Prompt systemic glucocorticoid therapy**
   - **Supplemental oxygen** to maintain **oxygen saturation >93%**  
7. Clinicians should screen for **patient factors that increase the risk of asthma-related death** and provide **counseling**.  

#### 💬 Extra
3. Written plans improve **self-recognition** of exacerbations and encourage **timely escalation** of care.  
4. The listed **self-treatment strategies** are the cornerstone of **early outpatient exacerbation management**.  
6. Oxygen supplementation is aimed at maintaining **oxygen saturation >93%**, not simply preventing desaturation.
