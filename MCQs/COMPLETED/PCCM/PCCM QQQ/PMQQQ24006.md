### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Step-Up Therapy for Mild Persistent Asthma

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **asthma** who require a **short-acting β2-agonist (SABA)** more than **twice per week** but less than **4–5 times per week** for symptom control are **uncontrolled**.
2. Patients with uncontrolled mild persistent **asthma** should be stepped up to **as-needed low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** as the **controller and reliever**.
3. **Inhaler technique** should be confirmed at initiation of asthma therapy and **reviewed regularly**.
4. **Short-acting anticholinergic** therapy (for example, **ipratropium**) is **less effective than β2-agonists** and is **adjunctive** only for **acute exacerbations**.
5. **Leukotriene‑receptor antagonists (LTRAs)** such as **montelukast** are **not preferred first‑line controller therapy** for asthma.
6. **LTRAs** may be useful in **aspirin‑exacerbated respiratory disease** and for **exercise‑induced bronchospasm** prevention.
7. **Long‑acting β2‑agonist (LABA) monotherapy** (for example, **salmeterol alone**) is **not appropriate** in asthma.
8. **LABA therapy alone** is **not recommended** in asthma because of **increased risk for asthma‑related death**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The **Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2024** step‑up preference at this symptom frequency is **as‑needed low‑dose inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol**.
6. LTRAs can reduce **exercise‑induced symptoms**, but combination **inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** remains preferred for control.

#### ✅ True Statements — Management of Chronic Asthma
1. **Longitudinal asthma management goals** are to **control chronic symptoms**, **prevent exacerbations**, and **minimize risk of persistent airway obstruction**.
2. Asthma care uses a **stepwise approach** based on **severity assessment**, **ongoing symptom control**, and **therapy modification**.
3. **Asthma Control Test** and **Asthma Control Questionnaire** can distinguish **well‑controlled** from **inadequately controlled** asthma.
4. Patients with **daytime symptoms <2 times weekly** and **nocturnal symptoms <2 times monthly** in the prior 4 weeks are **well controlled**.
5. **All patients with asthma** should have **quick‑relief medication** available **as needed**.
6. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** are the **most effective controller medications** for asthma.
7. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** reduce **airway mucosal edema**, **mucus hypersecretion**, and **airway inflammation**.
8. In **active smokers**, higher **inhaled glucocorticoid** doses may be required because effectiveness is **diminished**.
9. **LABAs** should be used **only with inhaled glucocorticoids** because **LABA monotherapy** increases **asthma‑related death** risk.
10. **Single‑inhaler** inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy is preferred to separate inhalers owing to **adherence** and **cost** advantages.
11. **Tiotropium (LAMA)** improves **lung function** and **reduces exacerbations** when added for **asthma uncontrolled** with inhaled glucocorticoid + LABA.
12. **Oral glucocorticoids** are important for **acute exacerbations**, but **long‑term use should be avoided** because of systemic adverse effects.
13. **Biologic therapies** (for example, **omalizumab**, **mepolizumab**, **reslizumab**, **benralizumab**, **dupilumab**, **tezepelumab**) are options for **severe asthma not controlled** on standard therapy.
14. **Omalizumab** reduces **exacerbations** and **emergency department visits** in **moderate to severe atopic asthma**.
15. Before biologic therapy, clinicians should verify **medication adherence**, **inhaler technique**, and **comorbidity management**.
16. **Nonpharmacologic therapy** includes **trigger avoidance/allergen management**, **tobacco smoke reduction**, **healthy diet**, and **exercise/weight loss**.
17. **Bronchial thermoplasty** may reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life in selected patients with **severe, poorly controlled asthma** and **FEV₁ >60% predicted**.

#### 💬 Extra
6. Benefits of inhaled glucocorticoids outweigh risks at usual doses; pneumonia risk rises mainly at **high‑dose/high‑potency** formulations.
14. **Type 2 inflammation** phenotyping uses **IgE** and **eosinophil** markers to select biologics.

  <figcaption>
    2020 guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommend that all adults and adolescents with mild persistent asthma use a daily inhaled glucocorticoid with an as-needed short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) or use both on an as-needed basis. Those with moderate persistent asthma should use a single inhaler with glucocorticoids and formoterol daily plus additional doses of the combination regimen as needed (known as single maintenance and reliever therapy, or SMART). For step-up therapy, daily medium- to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids and a long-acting β2-agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist and SABA as needed should be used.<br>
