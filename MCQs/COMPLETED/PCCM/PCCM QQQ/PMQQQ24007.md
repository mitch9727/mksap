### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Cough-Variant Asthma

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cough-variant asthma** refers to **asthma in which the predominant manifestation is cough**, without other typical asthma symptoms such as **wheezing, breathlessness, or chest tightness**.
2. In patients with **chronic cough**, a **methacholine challenge test** is indicated when **spirometry is normal** to evaluate for **bronchial hyperreactivity**, which supports a diagnosis of asthma.
3. A **methacholine challenge test** is considered **positive** if methacholine causes **forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)** to drop by **20% or more** compared with baseline FEV1.
4. A **positive methacholine challenge test** is not specific enough to diagnose asthma; patients with cough and a positive test must also **respond clinically to asthma therapies** to be considered to have **cough-variant asthma**.
5. **High-resolution chest CT** is used to evaluate for **interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis** in chronic cough when chest radiograph or examination suggests these conditions, but **asthma should be excluded first** if these features are absent.
6. **CT of the sinuses** is not indicated in chronic cough when **no nasal or sinus symptoms** are reported.
7. **Esophageal manometry and 24-hour pH testing** are not appropriate for chronic cough without **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms**; guidelines recommend an **empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors and lifestyle modification** before invasive testing.
8. Common causes of **chronic cough** (in the absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor use or environmental exposures) include **asthma, GERD, and rhinosinusitis**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. **Methacholine challenge testing** uses a controlled inhaled stimulus to induce **bronchospasm** in association with spirometry.
5. If the chest radiograph and history are normal, **interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis** are less likely than asthma.
7. GERD-related cough is often treated empirically before pursuing invasive diagnostic procedures.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with asthma whose **primary symptom is chronic cough without other symptoms** are considered to have **cough-variant asthma**.
2. Diagnosis of **cough-variant asthma** often requires documentation of **bronchial hyperreactivity** with a **methacholine challenge test**, because most patients have **normal baseline spirometry**.
3. **Recommended therapies for cough-variant asthma** are the same as those for **other types of asthma**.
4. Other causes of **chronic cough** that should be investigated include **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** and **upper airway cough syndrome** resulting from **rhinitis**.
5. **GERD, rhinitis, and cough-variant asthma** frequently **coexist** and may require **concomitant therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This form of asthma may be missed without testing, since **wheezing and dyspnea** are absent.
4. Rhinitis-related chronic cough is often referred to as **upper airway cough syndrome**.
