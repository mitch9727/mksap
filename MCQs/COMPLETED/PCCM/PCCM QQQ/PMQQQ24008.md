#### ✅ True Statements
1. Treatment of **asthma during pregnancy** is similar to treatment in **nonpregnant patients**.
2. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** are considered **safe in pregnancy**.
3. **Budesonide** has abundant long-term safety data and is the **preferred inhaled glucocorticoid** in pregnancy.
4. With the exception of **zileuton**, most **leukotriene modifiers** are considered **safe in pregnancy**.
5. **Low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid plus a short-acting β2-agonist (SABA)** is the recommended therapy for **mild persistent asthma** during pregnancy.
6. Untreated **maternal asthma** increases the risk of **perinatal mortality**, **preterm birth**, **low birth weight**, and **preeclampsia**.
7. Treatment with a **regular daily low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid** and an **as-needed SABA** reduces **asthma symptoms**, **severe exacerbations**, **hospitalization**, and **death**.
8. For **persistent asthma symptoms or exacerbations** despite low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid and as-needed SABA, the preferred **step-up therapy** is a **combination of low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid and long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)**, such as **fluticasone-salmeterol** or **budesonide-formoterol**.
9. **Prednisone** is used to treat **asthma exacerbations** but is **not indicated** for mild persistent asthma without evidence of exacerbation.
10. All patients with asthma should have a **written asthma action plan** for management of exacerbations and initiation of **self-treatment**.
11. **Peak flow monitoring alone** is not appropriate without initiation of **pharmacotherapy** in patients with frequent asthma symptoms.
