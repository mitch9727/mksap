### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Diagnosis of COPD with Spirometry

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Spirometry** is required for the **clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.  
2. **Spirometry** should be performed in any patient with **dyspnea, chronic cough, or sputum production**.  
3. For diagnosis of **COPD**, spirometry must be performed **before and after administration of an inhaled bronchodilator**.  
4. A **postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio <0.70 of predicted** is diagnostic of **airflow obstruction that is not completely reversible** and is consistent with **COPD**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Clinical findings such as **dyspnea on exertion**, **wheezing**, and **chronic cough** may suggest COPD, but **spirometry is required for confirmation**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Diagnosis of COPD
1. The possibility of **COPD** should be considered and **spirometry performed** in patients with **progressive dyspnea**, **chronic cough with or without sputum production**, or **recurrent lower respiratory tract infections**, particularly in the presence of **risk factors such as smoking**.  
2. The role of **screening spirometry** in **asymptomatic individuals with risk factors** is controversial.  
3. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force** recommends **against screening** for **COPD** in asymptomatic adults.  
4. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)** suggests performing **screening spirometry** in individuals with **risk factors** for **COPD**.  
5. In the appropriate clinical context, **COPD is diagnosed using spirometry to document airflow obstruction**.  
6. **COPD** is confirmed by a **postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70**, which differs from **asthma**, where **airflow obstruction is reversible** with bronchodilator therapy.  
7. **Measuring lung volumes and diffusing capacity** is **not required** to diagnose **COPD**, but may help to determine **disease severity**.  
8. Clinicians should rule out other causes of **chronic respiratory symptoms**, including **heart failure**, **bronchiectasis**, **obliterative bronchiolitis**, **tuberculosis**, and **diffuse panbronchiolitis**.  

#### 💬 Extra
6. The key diagnostic distinction between **COPD** and **asthma** is the **irreversibility of airflow obstruction** in COPD.
