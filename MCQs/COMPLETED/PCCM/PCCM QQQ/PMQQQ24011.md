### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Acute Exacerbation of COPD Treatment

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation** is defined as a sustained worsening of symptoms, typically **dyspnea, cough, and sputum production**.
2. Standard treatment of **moderate to severe COPD exacerbations** includes **antibiotics** and **oral glucocorticoids**.
3. **Short-acting bronchodilator therapy** is the mainstay of treatment for **COPD exacerbations**.
4. **Glucocorticoids** in **COPD exacerbations** reduce recovery time, improve lung function, improve arterial hypoxemia, and decrease relapse risk, treatment failure, and hospital length of stay.
5. Guidelines recommend **prednisone 40 mg daily (or oral equivalent) for 5 days** for **COPD exacerbations**.
6. **Antibiotics** should be considered in **moderate or severe COPD exacerbations** with **increased dyspnea, increased sputum, and sputum purulence**.
7. Common antibiotic regimens for **COPD exacerbations** include a **macrolide (e.g., azithromycin)**, a **cephalosporin**, or **doxycycline**.
8. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** are indicated for **long-term COPD management with recurrent exacerbations**, not for acute treatment.
9. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** is strongly recommended in **acute COPD exacerbations with respiratory acidosis**.
10. **Roflumilast** decreases the frequency of recurrent **COPD exacerbations** but has no role in acute treatment.

#### 💬 Extra
9. This patient was not hypoxic and improved with initial therapy, so there was no indication for noninvasive PPV.

#### ✅ True Statements — Therapeutic Management of COPD Exacerbation
1. Management goals during an **acute COPD exacerbation** are to **relieve acute symptoms** and **prevent future exacerbations**.
2. **Supplemental oxygen** should be used to maintain oxygen saturation between **88% and 92%** in **COPD exacerbations**.
3. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** may be required if adequate oxygenation or ventilation cannot be maintained in **COPD exacerbations**.
4. **Intubation and mechanical ventilation** may be required in **COPD exacerbations** if patients cannot tolerate noninvasive PPV, have **altered mental status**, or develop **worsening hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure** despite noninvasive PPV.
5. **Short-acting β-agonists (SABAs)**, with or without **anticholinergic agents**, should be used to relieve acute symptoms of a **COPD exacerbation**.
6. **Oral glucocorticoids** in **COPD exacerbations** decrease treatment failure, decrease hospital length of stay, decrease risk of early relapse, improve FEV1, and improve hypoxemia.
7. **Early use of glucocorticoids** in **COPD exacerbations** decreases the need for hospitalization.
8. **Randomized trials** have demonstrated that **prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days** is usually equivalent to **longer courses, higher doses, or intravenous glucocorticoids** in **COPD exacerbations**.
9. **Viruses** are the most common infectious triggers of **COPD exacerbations**.
10. Bacterial causes of **COPD exacerbations** include **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, **Haemophilus influenzae**, **Moraxella catarrhalis**, and **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**.
11. **Antibiotics** should be prescribed for **5 to 7 days** in **COPD exacerbations** if invasive or noninvasive ventilation is required, if all three cardinal symptoms are present (**dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence**), or if two symptoms are present when one is increased sputum purulence.
12. A **systematic review and meta-analysis (2020)** showed that in **mild to severe COPD exacerbations**, the combination of **antibiotics and oral glucocorticoids** reduced treatment failure.
13. **Smoking cessation** during or after a **COPD exacerbation** prevents future exacerbations.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Targeting SpO₂ 88–92% helps avoid worsening hypercapnia from excessive oxygen.  
8. Short courses reduce cumulative steroid side effects while maintaining efficacy.  
9. Viral etiologies are more common than bacterial triggers, but antibiotics are still indicated in select cases.  
13. Smoking cessation is the most effective long-term intervention for preventing exacerbations.
