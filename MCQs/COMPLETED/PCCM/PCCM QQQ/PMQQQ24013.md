### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Noninvasive Ventilation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)** is marked by **chronic hypoventilation during sleep**, which may be exacerbated by **acute illness** and **anesthesia**.
2. **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** augments ventilation by providing **pressure support**, improves **quality of life**, and may **prolong survival** in patients with **ALS**.
3. **Ventilatory support** should be started in **ALS** when **respiratory symptoms** or **hypercapnia** are present.
4. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** maintains **upper airway patency** in **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** and is not appropriate ventilatory support for **ALS-related hypoventilation**.
5. **Hypoglossal nerve stimulation** activates the tongue muscles to increase **upper airway caliber** and is used for **OSA**, but has no effect on **respiratory pump muscles weakened by ALS**.
6. **Supplemental oxygen** should not be prescribed for patients with **ALS and hypoventilation** without **ventilatory support**, because it may worsen **hypercapnia** in the setting of **respiratory muscle weakness**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Elevated arterial **Pco₂** with metabolic alkalosis but normal pH indicates **chronic hypoventilation**.
2. Discussing **prognosis** and establishing **goals of care** with patients and families is essential to avoid unnecessary interventions.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation devices** are prescribed to alleviate **sleep-related symptoms** and support **oxygen levels** in patients with **neuromuscular disorders**.
2. **BPAP** or **volume-assured devices** (such as **average volume-assured pressure support**) with or without **supplemental oxygen** are indicated when **daytime hypercapnia** suggests **chronic respiratory failure**.
3. **Polysomnography** may be useful for optimizing **ventilator and oxygen settings** and for assessing **concomitant sleep disorders**, though it is **not always required**.
4. **Tracheostomy and home mechanical ventilation** are **effective** and may be appropriate for some patients with **neuromuscular disorders**.
5. **Supplemental oxygen** may **depress ventilation** in patients with **respiratory muscle weakness** and should generally **not** be prescribed without **adjunctive ventilatory support**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. **Volume‑assured devices** target a **specific tidal volume** by adjusting **inspiratory pressure**.
3. While helpful for titration, **sleep studies** are **not mandatory** for initiating noninvasive support.

#### ✅ True Statements — Characteristics and Indications of Positive Airway Pressure Modes
1. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** is a **fixed pressure** modality derived from **in-laboratory titration** attended by a technician and is indicated for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** and **occasionally central sleep apnea (CSA)**.
2. **Auto‑adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP)** delivers a **range of pressures** to maintain **upper airway patency** based on a **proprietary computer algorithm** and is indicated for **OSA**.
3. **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** provides **inspiratory pressure support** above a **minimum expiratory pressure** derived from **in‑laboratory titration** and is indicated for **hypoventilation syndromes**.
4. **Auto‑BPAP** delivers a **range of bilevel pressures** determined by a **proprietary computer algorithm** and has the **same indications as BPAP**.
5. **Adaptive servo‑ventilation (ASV)** adjusts **inspiratory pressure support** and a **back‑up rate** on a **breath‑by‑breath** basis using a **proprietary algorithm** with **expiratory pressure set by a technician**; it is indicated for **CSA (including mixed CSA and OSA)** and should **not** be used in **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**.
6. **Auto‑ASV** determines both **inspiratory and expiratory pressures** via a **proprietary algorithm** and has the **same indications as ASV**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. For CPAP, the table specifies **technician‑attended titration** as the source of the fixed pressure.
2. For APAP and Auto‑BPAP, the **algorithmic determination** of pressures is emphasized rather than clinician‑set values.
5. The **do‑not‑use** warning with **HFrEF** is explicitly stated in the table under ASV indications.
