### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Bronchiectasis Diagnosis on Chest CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchiectasis** is **irreversible pathologic dilation of the bronchi or bronchioles** resulting from infection or other causes in the context of **airway obstruction**, **impaired drainage**, or **abnormal antimicrobial defenses**.  
2. The **pattern of lung involvement** in bronchiectasis may be **focal or diffuse**, depending on the underlying cause.  
3. **Bronchiectasis** causes a **chronic or recurrent cough** that is typically associated with **voluminous sputum production** and **purulent exacerbations**.  
4. Most **chest radiographs** in bronchiectasis are abnormal, often showing **linear atelectasis**, **dilated and thickened airways**, and **irregular peripheral opacities**.  
5. **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** of the chest is the **definitive diagnostic test** for bronchiectasis.  
6. Typical findings of bronchiectasis on HRCT include **airway dilatation with lack of tapering**, **bronchial wall thickening**, and **cysts**.  
7. Evaluation of **bronchiectasis** should include determining the **underlying cause**, such as **chronic bacterial or mycobacterial infection**, **connective tissue disease**, or **immune deficiency**.  
8. In selected cases, testing for **cystic fibrosis** or **α1-antitrypsin deficiency** may be appropriate when suspected.

6. On HRCT, the attached image illustrates **airway dilatation with lack of tapering (green arrow)**, **bronchial wall thickening (yellow arrow)**, and **cysts (red arrow)**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Initial evaluation for **bronchiectasis** should include a comprehensive medical history, including **childhood diseases** and **family history**, and careful exclusion of known causes.  
2. **Bronchiectasis** is diagnosed by **high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** of the chest.  
3. Diagnostic criteria for **bronchiectasis** on **HRCT** include an **airway diameter greater than that of its accompanying vessel** and **lack of distal airway tapering**.  
4. **Bronchial wall thickening** or **cysts** may be present on **HRCT** in **bronchiectasis**.  
5. Every patient diagnosed with **bronchiectasis** requires evaluation for a **treatable underlying cause**.  
6. Evaluation for underlying causes of **bronchiectasis** may involve testing for **chronic bacterial** or **mycobacterial infections** to identify potential causes of disease progression and to help determine targeted antimicrobial therapy for exacerbations.  
7. Patients with **bronchiectasis** should be evaluated for the presence of **connective tissue disease** and **immune dysfunction**, including **immunoglobulin deficiencies**.  
8. In select patients with **bronchiectasis**, testing for **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, **ciliary dysfunction**, or **α1-antitrypsin deficiency** may be appropriate.  
9. Even with rigorous evaluation, more than **50% of bronchiectasis cases** are labeled **idiopathic**.

3. The hallmark CT features—bronchus larger than adjacent artery and absent tapering—are demonstrated in the supplemental figure.
