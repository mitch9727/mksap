### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)** is characterized by **daytime hypercapnia**, defined as **arterial Pco₂ >45 mm Hg (6.0 kPa)**, resulting from **diminished ventilatory drive and capacity** related to **obesity**.  
2. Persons with a **body mass index (BMI) ≥30** are at risk for **OHS**.  
3. More than **50% of patients with BMI ≥50** have **OHS**.  
4. **Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy**, either **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** or **bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)**, sometimes with **supplemental oxygen**, is **first-line therapy** for **OHS**.  
5. **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** is typically encountered on sleep testing in patients with **OHS**, with **upper airway collapse** superimposed on **obesity-related hypoventilation**.  
6. **Severe OSA** is defined as an **apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >30 events per hour**.  
7. **Mild OSA** is defined as an **apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5–14 events per hour**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Hypercapnia in **OHS** is **chronic and compensated**, often with **polycythemia** and **hypoxemia** that is more pronounced during sleep.  
2. Differential diagnoses of hypoventilation include **neuromuscular diseases** (e.g., **amyotrophic lateral sclerosis**) and **central sleep apnea**, but these conditions typically have different examination or gas exchange findings.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)** results from a combination of the **mechanical load on the respiratory pump** and **blunting of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide**.  
2. A **serum bicarbonate level >27 mEq/L (27 mmol/L)** is a clue to the diagnosis of **OHS**.  
3. Patients with **OHS** may present with **polycythemia**, **right-sided heart failure**, and **pulmonary hypertension** due to **chronic hypercapnia and hypoxia**.  
4. Other causes of **hypercapnia and hypoventilation**, including **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** and **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**, must be excluded before diagnosing **OHS**.  
5. **Polysomnography (sleep study)** should be performed in all patients with suspected **OHS**.  
6. **Gas exchange impairment** beyond the typical repetitive desaturations of sleep apnea syndromes is often encountered on sleep testing in **OHS**.  
7. **Weight loss** is essential in the management of **OHS**, and **bariatric surgery** may be considered.  
8. The **American Thoracic Society (ATS)** recommends **CPAP therapy** for **stable ambulatory patients with OHS**, regardless of whether **concomitant severe OSA** is present.  
9. For **hospitalized patients with suspected OHS-related respiratory failure**, the **ATS** recommends either **BPAP (with or without a backup rate)** or **volume-targeted pressure support**.  
10. **BPAP or volume-targeted pressure support** should be continued after hospital discharge until **polysomnography** can be performed and **positive-pressure support titrated**.  
11. **Supplemental oxygen** may be necessary in **OHS** but should **not** be given as the **only treatment**.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. Elevated **serum bicarbonate** reflects chronic **respiratory acidosis compensation**.  
3. Secondary complications of **OHS** arise from **prolonged hypoxemia and hypercapnia**.  
5. Sleep testing distinguishes **OHS with OSA** from other sleep-related breathing disorders.
