### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Right Middle Lobe Atelectasis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Right middle lobe atelectasis** appears on frontal chest radiograph as a **vague density partially obscuring the right heart border**.
2. On lateral chest radiograph, **right middle lobe atelectasis** appears as a **triangular opacity** representing collapse of the right middle lobe.
3. With **right middle lobe collapse**, the **right major fissure** is displaced anteriorly and the **minor fissure** is displaced inferiorly.
4. **Right middle lobe atelectasis** occurs more frequently than atelectasis of other lobes.
5. Factors predisposing to **right middle lobe atelectasis** include: compression of the bronchus by surrounding **lymph nodes** enlarged by tumor or inflammation, **less collateral ventilation**, and **increased airflow resistance** due to the curved and narrow bronchus.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The frontal film shows the right heart border silhouette sign, consistent with middle lobe disease.
2. The triangular shape on lateral film is classic for lobar collapse.
4. Right middle lobe syndrome is a recognized clinical entity due to this predisposition.
5. The narrow, curved bronchus and surrounding lymph node anatomy explain the relative frequency of involvement.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atelectasis** is a common **postoperative complication**.
2. Pain or impaired respiratory mechanics after thoracic and abdominal surgery can lead to **shallow breathing** and **cough suppression**, promoting atelectasis.
3. Patients with **atelectasis** may be **asymptomatic** or may present with **labored breathing**, **diminished breath sounds at the lung bases**, **egophony**, **rhonchi**, and **consolidation on imaging**.
4. Management of **atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, and **secretion management**.
5. **Respiratory physiotherapy** (inspiratory muscle training, deep breathing, mobility programs, percussion, vibration therapy) helps **prevent and treat atelectasis**.
6. **Routine bronchoscopy** for airway mucous clearance offers **no clear benefit** compared with other chest physiotherapy and should be reserved for cases not improving after 24 hours of physiotherapy.
7. If secretions are minimal, **positive expiratory pressure devices** may be used to recruit collapsed alveoli in atelectasis.
8. **Mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine** have **no proven benefit** for atelectasis treatment.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Postoperative pain is a major contributor due to splinting and reduced inspiratory effort.
5. Multiple physiotherapy modalities are effective for both prevention and treatment.
6. Bronchoscopy is invasive and should be reserved for refractory cases.
