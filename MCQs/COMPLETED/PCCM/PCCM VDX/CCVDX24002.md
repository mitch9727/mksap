### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Left Lung Atelectasis Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left lung atelectasis** can be caused by **obstruction of the left main bronchus**.
2. **Chest radiograph findings of left lung atelectasis** include **diffuse, dense opacification of the left hemithorax**.
3. **Left lung atelectasis** is associated with **loss of volume on the left side**, demonstrated by **leftward movement of the mediastinum and trachea**.
4. **Leftward displacement of the heart** in left lung atelectasis can be inferred from the **absence of the right heart border to the right of the spine**.
5. The **position of the heart** in left lung atelectasis can also be inferred by the **leftward position of a pulmonary artery catheter**.
6. **Obstruction of the main bronchus** leading to atelectasis may be due to **aspirated material** or **large mucus plugs**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The obstruction of the left main bronchus is the underlying mechanism of volume loss in this case.
4. The absence of the right heart border on chest radiograph is an indirect sign of mediastinal shift toward the left.

#### ✅ True Statements — Atelectasis
1. **Atelectasis** is a common **postoperative complication**.
2. **Thoracic surgery** and **abdominal surgery** can lead to **atelectasis** by causing pain or impaired respiratory mechanics that result in **shallow breathing** and **cough suppression**.
3. Patients with **atelectasis** may be **asymptomatic** or present with **labored breathing**, **diminished breath sounds at the lung bases**, **egophony**, **rhonchi**, and **consolidation on imaging**.
4. Management of **atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, and **secretion management**.
5. **Respiratory physiotherapy** methods, including **inspiratory muscle training**, **deep breathing exercise**, **mobility programs**, and **percussion and vibration therapy**, help **prevent and treat atelectasis**.
6. **Bronchoscopy** for **routine airway mucous clearance** offers **no clear benefit** compared with other chest physiotherapy methods in **atelectasis**.
7. **Bronchoscopy** should be considered for **atelectasis** when **24 hours of respiratory physiotherapy** fails to improve the condition.
8. If secretions are minimal in **atelectasis**, **positive-pressure airway therapy** (such as **positive expiratory pressure devices**) may be considered to **recruit collapsed alveoli**.
9. There is **no evidence** supporting the use of **mucolytics**, such as **N-acetylcysteine**, for the treatment of **atelectasis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atelectasis is particularly frequent in the immediate postoperative period due to pain and impaired lung expansion.
3. Egophony and rhonchi reflect impaired ventilation and possible retained secretions.
5. Physiotherapy approaches are non-invasive first-line strategies in both prevention and treatment.
6. Invasive interventions like bronchoscopy are reserved for cases not responding to standard physiotherapy.
8. Positive expiratory pressure devices work by increasing intrathoracic pressure to reopen collapsed alveoli.
