### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Multilobar Pneumonia Radiographic Findings

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Multilobar pneumonia** appears on chest radiograph as **bilateral alveolar opacifications with air bronchograms**.
2. **Right and left hemidiaphragms** may be **partially obscured** on chest radiograph due to **lower lobe infiltrates** in multilobar pneumonia.
3. **Obscuration of the right heart border** on chest radiograph suggests an **infiltrate in the right middle lobe**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Air bronchograms are a key imaging feature that help distinguish **pneumonia** from other causes of opacification such as effusion or mass.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pneumonia** is a **common cause of respiratory failure** in the intensive care unit (ICU).
2. **Pneumonia** is the **most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** that develops outside the hospital.
3. In patients with an appropriate clinical history, **chest radiography** is the **standard diagnostic tool** for pneumonia.
4. A **negative clinical examination or chest radiograph** does **not exclude community-acquired pneumonia** in symptomatic patients, especially **older adults**.
5. The **absence of typical features or focal infiltrates** on chest radiograph should **not preclude early antibiotic administration** when the probability of pneumonia is otherwise high.
6. Some guidelines recommend **glucocorticoid administration** for **severe community-acquired pneumonia** in addition to antimicrobial therapy.

#### 💬 Extra
4. Older adults may have **atypical radiographic findings** or delayed imaging changes despite active pneumonia.
5. Early empiric antibiotics improve outcomes when pneumonia is strongly suspected, even without radiographic confirmation.
6. Glucocorticoid therapy in severe community-acquired pneumonia remains **guideline-dependent** and is not universally adopted.
