### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Right Lower Lobe Atelectasis Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Right lower lobe atelectasis** on a frontal chest radiograph is characterized by a **triangular opacity** in the right lower lung field demarcated by the **inferiorly and medially displaced major fissure**.
2. In **right lower lobe atelectasis**, the **right interlobar pulmonary artery** is no longer visible on a frontal radiograph because it is obscured by the collapsed lobe.
3. In **right lower lobe atelectasis**, the **hemidiaphragm border** is obliterated, suggesting a lower lobe process.
4. On a lateral chest radiograph, **right lower lobe atelectasis** appears as a **vague triangular opacity** obscuring the lower thoracic vertebrae.
5. The **right bronchus**, particularly the mainstem bronchus or divisions of the right lower lobe bronchus, is the most common site of **aspiration in adults**.
6. The **right bronchus** is the most common site of aspiration in adults because of its **more vertical angle** compared with the left bronchus.
7. The **right bronchus** is the most common site of aspiration in adults because of its **larger diameter** compared with the left bronchus.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The triangular opacity corresponds to collapse of the right lower lobe, bounded by the displaced fissure (arrows in figure).
2. Vascular markings such as the right interlobar artery become obscured due to lobar collapse.
4. On lateral view, vertebral bodies appear obscured by overlying collapsed lung tissue.
5. Aspiration risk is determined by airway anatomy; the right lower lobe bronchi present the least resistance path.

#### ✅ True Statements — Atelectasis
1. **Atelectasis** is a common **postoperative complication**.
2. **Thoracic surgery** and **abdominal surgery** can lead to **atelectasis** by causing pain or impaired respiratory mechanics that result in **shallow breathing** and **cough suppression**.
3. Patients with **atelectasis** may be **asymptomatic** or present with **labored breathing**, **diminished breath sounds at the lung bases**, **egophony**, **rhonchi**, and **consolidation on imaging**.
4. Management of **atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, and **secretion management**.
5. **Respiratory physiotherapy** methods, including **inspiratory muscle training**, **deep breathing exercise**, **mobility programs**, and **percussion and vibration therapy**, help **prevent and treat atelectasis**.
6. **Bronchoscopy** for **routine airway mucous clearance** offers **no clear benefit** compared with other chest physiotherapy methods in **atelectasis**.
7. **Bronchoscopy** should be considered for **atelectasis** when **24 hours of respiratory physiotherapy** fails to improve the condition.
8. If secretions are minimal in **atelectasis**, **positive-pressure airway therapy** (such as **positive expiratory pressure devices**) may be considered to **recruit collapsed alveoli**.
9. There is **no evidence** supporting the use of **mucolytics**, such as **N-acetylcysteine**, for the treatment of **atelectasis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Atelectasis is particularly frequent in the immediate postoperative period due to pain and impaired lung expansion.
3. Egophony and rhonchi reflect impaired ventilation and possible retained secretions.
5. Physiotherapy approaches are non-invasive first-line strategies in both prevention and treatment.
6. Invasive interventions like bronchoscopy are reserved for cases not responding to standard physiotherapy.
8. Positive expiratory pressure devices work by increasing intrathoracic pressure to reopen collapsed alveoli.
