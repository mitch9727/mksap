### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Right Lung Atelectasis from Endobronchial Obstruction

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atelectasis** is the loss of gas within the lung with a resultant decrease in lung volume.
2. Significant **atelectasis** may cause an **ipsilateral mediastinal shift**.
3. **Right lung atelectasis** can be caused by an obstruction within the **right mainstem bronchus**, such as an **endobronchial tumor** or a **large mucous plug**.
4. **Massive pleural effusion** can cause complete opacification of a hemithorax but does **not** cause ipsilateral mediastinal deviation; instead, if large enough, it causes **contralateral displacement** of mediastinal structures.
5. **Pneumonia** is unlikely to cause mediastinal shift.

#### 💬 Extra
2. In the case described, atelectasis of the right lung caused a rightward mediastinal shift, demonstrated by displacement of the trachea and left mainstem bronchus.
4. This distinction between atelectasis and effusion helps differentiate causes of a completely opacified hemithorax.

#### ✅ True Statements — Pulmonary Embolism
1. **Pulmonary embolism (PE)** causes respiratory failure primarily through **ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch**.  
2. After acute **PE**, resistance to pulmonary blood flow increases due to **thrombosis** and **vasospasm** of adjacent pulmonary vessels mediated by inflammation.  
3. In **PE**, blood is redirected to normal lung regions, which may become **overperfused**.  
4. **Hypoxemia** occurs if alveolar oxygen levels in overperfused normal lung are insufficient to oxygenate blood.  
5. **Shunt physiology** contributes to hypoxemia in **PE** when blood flows through **atelectatic lung**.  
6. In **PE** with significant pulmonary arterial obstruction, **right ventricular (RV) strain** and **decreased cardiac output** may occur.  
7. When **RV strain** occurs in conjunction with **V/Q mismatch** and **shunt**, oxygenation of blood before leaving alveolar capillaries is impaired, worsening **hypoxemia**.  
8. Most patients with hypoxemia after **PE** can be managed with **supplemental oxygen alone**.  
9. Some patients with **PE** require **intubation and mechanical ventilation**.  
10. **Mechanical ventilation** in **PE with RV dysfunction** can worsen hemodynamics by:  
    - Increasing **intrathoracic pressure**, reducing **venous return** and **RV preload**.  
    - Increasing **alveolar pressure**, compressing capillaries, and increasing **RV afterload**.  
11. These physiologic effects can worsen **RV dysfunction** and cause **hemodynamic instability** in patients with **PE**.  
12. Although not contraindicated, **mechanical ventilation in PE** requires anticipation of rapid **hemodynamic instability**.  
13. Hemodynamic instability in **PE** is managed with **vasopressors (norepinephrine)**, **oxygen**, careful use of **positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**, and sometimes **pulmonary vasodilators** (inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol).  
14. In **PE with hemodynamic collapse**, **thrombolytic therapy** improves clinical parameters and decreases mortality.  
15. **Thrombolytic therapy** in **PE** carries up to a **2% risk of intracranial hemorrhage**.  
16. In **PE** patients with **contraindications to thrombolysis**, or where **thrombolysis has failed**, **surgical or catheter-based embolectomy** is a treatment option.

#### 💬 Extra
10. The deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation in **PE** are due to both preload reduction and afterload increase, which can precipitate cardiovascular collapse.  
14. The mortality benefit of **thrombolysis** is demonstrated specifically in **hemodynamic collapse from PE**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Hypercapnic (Ventilatory) Respiratory Failure
1. **Hypercapnic (ventilatory) respiratory failure** occurs when **alveolar ventilation** is inadequate to clear **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** produced by cellular metabolism, resulting in **elevated arterial PCO₂**.  
2. **Hypercapnia** reflects **alveolar hypoventilation**, an **increased metabolic load** not matched by ventilation, or **both**.  
3. **Alveolar hypoventilation** occurs with **decreased respiratory rate**, **decreased tidal volume (VT)**, or **increased dead-space volume relative to VT (VD/VT)**.  
4. Clinical features of **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** are **variable** and **nonspecific**; **somnolence** and **myoclonic jerks** can occur with **CO₂ narcosis**.  
5. **Increased work of breathing** may precede the development of **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure**.  
6. **Preexisting chest wall deformity, neurologic weakness,** or **polycythemia** should prompt evaluation for **hypercapnia** in the setting of respiratory failure.  
7. Patients with **hypercapnic respiratory failure** frequently have **coexisting hypoxemia**; **supplemental oxygen** may **decrease hypoxemia** but **increase hypercapnia** via **ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch**, **decreased respiratory drive**, and the **Haldane effect**.  
8. Worsening **hypercapnia** with oxygen is **particularly problematic** for **neuromuscular diseases**, risking **obtundation** and **respiratory arrest**.  
9. **Arterial blood gas (ABG)** analysis should be obtained in **all suspected acute hypercapnic respiratory failure**, even if **hypoxemia resolves** with oxygen; **pH** helps determine **acuity and severity**.  
10. In **chronic hypercapnia**, **pH changes are less marked** because of **metabolic compensation** with **increased serum bicarbonate**.  
11. Management of **elevated arterial PCO₂** depends on the **clinical context** and **resultant pH**; in **COPD**, elevated PCO₂ may be **baseline**, whereas in **asthma**, rising PCO₂ may signal **imminent respiratory failure** requiring **emergent intubation**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Decreased Respiratory Drive
12. **Decreased respiratory drive** leads to **diminished alveolar CO₂ clearance** and **hypercapnia**; patients often present **somnolent** with **impaired airway protection**.  
13. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** improves **minute ventilation** and **gas exchange** and should be considered for patients who **can protect their airway**.  
14. **ABGs** should be checked **within 2 hours** of **noninvasive PPV** initiation to ensure improvement.  
15. If patients **do not improve** with adequate **noninvasive PPV**, **intubation** is warranted.  
16. If **airway protection is compromised**, or **pH <7.25** or **hemodynamic instability** is present, **intubation and mechanical ventilation** are indicated.  
17. **Respiratory stimulants** (e.g., **acetazolamide**, **theophylline**, **progestin**) have **theoretical benefit** but **limited supporting data**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Drug Overdose
18. **Sedating drugs**, **anesthetics**, and **severe alcohol intoxication** can **depress central respiratory drive**; consultation with **poison control** helps determine management.

#### ✅ True Statements — Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
19. **Obesity hypoventilation syndrome** is defined by **obesity (BMI ≥30)**, **sleep-disordered breathing**, and **persistent daytime hypercapnia (arterial PCO₂ >45 mm Hg [6.0 kPa])**.  
20. Hypercapnia in **obesity hypoventilation syndrome** stems from **low tidal volumes** and **inappropriate central respiratory response**; **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** from this syndrome is a **diagnosis of exclusion**.  
21. **2019 American Thoracic Society guidelines** recommend **noninvasive ventilation** (bilevel positive airway pressure or **volume-targeted pressure support**) for **hospitalized** patients suspected of **obesity hypoventilation syndrome**, continued until **outpatient evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea**.

6. **Preexisting chest wall deformity, neurologic weakness,** or **polycythemia** should prompt evaluation for **hypercapnia** in the setting of respiratory failure.  
7. Patients with **hypercapnic respiratory failure** frequently have **coexisting hypoxemia**; **supplemental oxygen** may **decrease hypoxemia** but **increase hypercapnia** via **ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch**, **decreased respiratory drive**, and the **Haldane effect**.  
8. Worsening **hypercapnia** with oxygen is **particularly problematic** for **neuromuscular diseases**, risking **obtundation** and **respiratory arrest**.  
9. **Arterial blood gas (ABG)** analysis should be obtained in **all suspected acute hypercapnic respiratory failure**, even if **hypoxemia resolves** with oxygen; **pH** helps determine **acuity and severity**.  
10. In **chronic hypercapnia**, **pH changes are less marked** because of **metabolic compensation** with **increased serum bicarbonate**.  
11. Management of **elevated arterial PCO₂** depends on the **clinical context** and **resultant pH**; in **COPD**, elevated PCO₂ may be **baseline**, whereas in **asthma**, rising PCO₂ may signal **imminent respiratory failure** requiring **emergent intubation**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Decreased Respiratory Drive
12. **Decreased respiratory drive** leads to **diminished alveolar CO₂ clearance** and **hypercapnia**; patients often present **somnolent** with **impaired airway protection**.  
13. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** improves **minute ventilation** and **gas exchange** and should be considered for patients who **can protect their airway**.  
14. **Arterial blood gases** should be checked **within 2 hours** of **noninvasive PPV** initiation to ensure improvement.  
15. If patients **do not improve** with adequate **noninvasive PPV**, **intubation** is warranted.  
16. If **airway protection is compromised**, or **pH <7.25** or **hemodynamic instability** is present, **intubation and mechanical ventilation** are indicated.  
17. **Respiratory stimulants** (e.g., **acetazolamide**, **theophylline**, **progestin**) have **theoretical benefit** but **limited supporting data**.

---

#### ✅ True Statements — Drug Overdose
18. **Sedating drugs**, **anesthetics**, and **severe alcohol intoxication** can **depress central respiratory drive**; consultation with **poison control** helps determine management.


---

#### ✅ True Statements — Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome
19. **Obesity hypoventilation syndrome** is defined by **obesity (BMI ≥30)**, **sleep-disordered breathing**, and **persistent daytime hypercapnia (arterial PCO₂ >45 mm Hg [6.0 kPa])**.  
20. Hypercapnia in **obesity hypoventilation syndrome** stems from **low tidal volumes** and **inappropriate central respiratory response**; **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** from this syndrome is a **diagnosis of exclusion**.  
21. **2019 American Thoracic Society guidelines** recommend **noninvasive ventilation** (bilevel positive airway pressure or **volume-targeted pressure support**) for **hospitalized** patients suspected of **obesity hypoventilation syndrome**, continued until **outpatient evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea**.

---

#### ✅ True Statements — Neuromuscular Weakness
22. The **diaphragm** is the primary inspiratory muscle and accounts for **more than two thirds** of ventilatory work; it is innervated by **phrenic nerves** from **C3–C5**.  
23. **Diaphragmatic weakness** is **common** in the ICU (e.g., **postsurgical phrenic nerve injury**, **ICU-acquired weakness**) and causes **orthopnea**, **shallow breathing**, and **paradoxical chest/abdominal motion**.  
24. **Intercostal and abdominal wall muscles** are required for **cough**; injury to lower cervical/upper thoracic roots impairs **secretion clearance**.  
25. **Bulbar weakness** (cranial nerves **IX–XII**) can cause **weak cough**, **secretion management difficulty**, or **voice change**.  
26. **Pulmonary function testing** components are **effort-dependent** and can be affected by **facial/bulbar/postural weakness**; **pressure measurements** may be **falsely low** in **severe obstructive lung disease**.  
27. **Guillain–Barré syndrome** typically presents with **ascending symmetric paralysis** and **areflexia** over **2–4 weeks**; **dysautonomia** is common and may cause **hemodynamic instability** or **arrhythmias**.  
28. About **25%** of **Guillain–Barré syndrome** patients develop **respiratory failure** and require **intubation** because recovery can take **days to weeks**.  
29. In **myasthenic crisis**, **muscle fatigability** is the hallmark; **diplopia**, **ptosis**, **dysarthria**, **limb weakness**, and **weak cough** are common; **early noninvasive PPV** may prevent **intubation**, but **airway protection** and **cough** must be carefully evaluated.  
30. **Acute spinal cord injuries at or above C5** invariably require **mechanical ventilation**; recovery of independent respiration may occur in **complete injury below C3** or **incomplete injury above C3**.  
31. **Atelectasis**, **aspiration pneumonia**, and **pulmonary emboli** are **common** after **spinal cord injury** and can cause **recurrent acute hypercapnic respiratory failure**; **noninvasive PPV** and **mechanical cough assist** are **essential**.

---

#### ✅ True Statements — Restrictive Chest Wall Disease
32. **Restrictive parenchymal lung disease** primarily causes **hypoxemia** without hypercapnia; **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** is **more common** with **extrapulmonary chest wall restriction** (e.g., **pectus deformity**, **scoliosis**, **kyphosis**).  
33. **Abdominal processes** (e.g., **ascites**, **severe pancreatitis**, **bowel distention**, **abdominal compartment syndrome** with **intra-abdominal pressure ≥20 mm Hg**) can compromise **respiratory mechanics** by **cephalad diaphragmatic force**.  
34. **Extrapulmonary restriction** usually causes **poor ventilatory reserve**; **acute insults** (e.g., **infection**, **sedatives**) may precipitate **hypercapnic respiratory failure**.  
35. **Noninvasive PPV** or **invasive mechanical ventilation** may be used while the **precipitating condition** is managed; in **thoracic cage deformity**, **noninvasive PPV** is **frequently sufficient**.

---

#### ✅ True Statements — Obstructive Lung Diseases (COPD and Asthma)
36. **COPD exacerbation** typically presents with **cough**, **increased or changed sputum**, and **progressive dyspnea**; **hypercapnic respiratory failure** may develop with **somnolence** and **myoclonus**.  
37. In **hypercapnic respiratory failure** from **COPD exacerbation**, **noninvasive PPV**—preferably **bilevel positive airway pressure**—is **initial therapy** to **reduce PCO₂**, improving **symptoms**, **intubation rates**, **hospital stay**, and **mortality**.  
38. If COPD patients **cannot protect the airway**, are **hemodynamically unstable**, or **fail noninvasive PPV**, **intubation and mechanical ventilation** are necessary.  
39. During **COPD exacerbation**, **excessive oxygen** can **worsen hypercapnia** via **V/Q mismatch**, **reduced drive**, and the **Haldane effect**; **oxygen** should be **titrated** to **SpO₂ 88%–92%**.  
40. In **asthma**, signs of **impending respiratory failure** include **upright posture**, **inability to speak in full sentences**, **diaphoresis**, **nasal flaring**, and **accessory muscle use**.  
41. In **asthma exacerbation**, **arterial blood gases** often show **respiratory alkalosis** from **rapid, shallow breathing**; **normalizing or rising PCO₂** may signal **impending respiratory failure**.  
42. **Severe asthma exacerbation** therapy includes **continuous inhaled bronchodilators**, **systemic glucocorticoids**, **intravenous fluids**, and **electrolyte correction**; **oxygen** should maintain **hemoglobin saturation 90%–95%**.  
43. If asthma is **refractory to conventional therapy**, **magnesium sulfate** or **helium-oxygen** may be considered; **aminophylline**, **mucolytics**, and **leukotriene receptor antagonists** are **not recommended** in severe refractory asthma; **antibiotics** only with **evidence of infection**.  
44. Evidence for **noninvasive PPV** in **asthma exacerbation** is **limited**; if used, **close monitoring** is required; for most with **respiratory failure**, **intubation and mechanical ventilation** are **recommended**.  
45. In **obstructive lung disease on mechanical ventilation**, **auto-PEEP** from **dynamic hyperinflation and air trapping** may reduce **venous return** and cause **hemodynamic instability**; minimizing **auto-PEEP** involves **prolonging expiratory time** (lower respiratory rate) and **bronchodilators**; doing so often requires **sedation or paralytics** and may necessitate **higher tidal volume** to maintain **minute ventilation**; **ABGs** should be **checked frequently**.
