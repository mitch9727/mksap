#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Invasive mechanical ventilation** uses an **endotracheal tube** or **tracheostomy** to deliver **positive pressure ventilation (PPV)**.
2. Indications for **invasive mechanical ventilation** include **hypoxemic** or **hypercapnic respiratory failure** with a **contraindication to noninvasive PPV** or **inability to protect the airway**.
3. The **ventilator mode** and settings should match the **clinical goal**, the **patient’s disease**, and **physiologic status**.
4. **Lung‑protective ventilation** aims to maintain **adequate minute ventilation and oxygenation** with the **lowest effective tidal volume** and **plateau pressure** to prevent **ventilator‑induced lung injury (VILI)**.
5. **Ventilator‑induced lung injury** results from **alveolar overdistension (volutrauma)** or **repeated alveolar collapse with expiration (atelectrauma)**.
6. When the risk of lung injury decreases and the patient is awake, the prevailing goal becomes **patient comfort**.
7. **Patient–ventilator synchrony** and comfort are usually achieved with **pressure support** or **synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)**.
8. Selection of mode should consider **respiratory muscle strength and endurance**, **presence of acidosis**, and **level of sedation**.
9. Patients should be **liberated from mechanical ventilation as soon as possible**.
10. **Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)** should be performed to assess readiness for unassisted breathing and extubation.
11. **Spontaneous breathing trials** should last **≥30 minutes and ≤2 hours** using **low pressure support (≤8 cm H₂O)** or a **T‑piece**.
12. Combining **SBTs** with **daily awakening trials** (holding sedatives) or **targeted light‑sedation protocols** reduces **ventilation time**, **ICU and hospital length of stay**, and **mortality**.

#### 💬 Extra
4. Lung‑protective strategies are fundamental for patients at risk of **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**.
5. The paired concepts of **volutrauma** and **atelectrauma** explain the major mechanisms of **VILI**.
11. Trial durations outside the **30–120 minute** window may misclassify extubation readiness.
12. Sedation minimization paired with SBTs is a high‑value bundle to shorten ventilation duration.

#### ✅ True Statements — *Most Frequently Used Ventilator Modes*
1. **Volume control assist/control (VC-CMVs)** delivers a **set tidal volume** regardless of patient effort, lung compliance, or resistance.  
2. In **VC-CMVs**, all breaths are **mandatory**, and the ventilator always cycles the breath once the set tidal volume is delivered.  
3. **VC-CMVs** ensure **minimum minute ventilation** but may provide less patient comfort because flow is fixed.

5. In **PC-CMVs**, all breaths are **mandatory**, and the ventilator cycles the breath after the **preset inspiratory time**.  
6. **PC-CMVs** ensure pressure does not rise above the set limit, serving the goal of **safety**.  
7. **Pressure support with continuous positive airway pressure (PC-CSVs)** allows all breaths to be **spontaneous**, triggered and cycled by the patient.  
8. In **PC-CSVs**, the patient determines the **size and timing of breaths**, promoting **comfort and synchrony**.  
9. **PC-CSVs** can be used to assess **extubation readiness** during spontaneous breathing trials.
