### 🫁 Critical Care Medicine: Left Lower Lobe Atelectasis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left lower lobe atelectasis** on frontal chest radiograph appears as an **opacification behind the heart** obscuring the **left hemidiaphragm**.  
2. **Left lower lobe atelectasis** causes **leftward displacement of the mediastinum** on chest radiograph.  
3. **Loss of volume** of the **left lower lobe** results in **medial movement** and radiographic appearance of the **left interlobar fissure**.  
4. On lateral radiograph, **left lower lobe atelectasis** produces a **subtle increase in density overlying the lumbar vertebrae inferiorly**, compared with the normal increased lucency of the lower vertebrae.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The opacity behind the heart is due to collapse and increased density of the lower lobe.  
2. Mediastinal shift reflects volume loss from the collapsed lobe.  
3. The interlobar fissure shifts medially because of the lobe’s collapse.  
4. Normal lower vertebrae appear lucent, but this density change indicates loss of aeration in the left lower lobe.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Atelectasis** is a **common postoperative complication**.  
2. **Pain** or **impaired respiratory mechanics** after **thoracic or abdominal surgeries** can cause **shallow breathing** and **reduced coughing**, leading to atelectasis.  
3. Patients with **atelectasis** may be **asymptomatic** or present with **labored breathing**, **diminished breath sounds at the lung bases**, **egophony**, **rhonchi**, and **consolidation on imaging**.  
4. Management of **atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, and **secretion management**.  
5. **Respiratory physiotherapy** (including inspiratory muscle training, deep breathing exercise, mobility programs, or percussion and vibration therapy) helps **prevent and treat atelectasis**.  
6. **Bronchoscopy** for routine **airway mucous clearance** offers **no clear benefit** compared with chest physiotherapy and should only be considered if **24 hours of respiratory physiotherapy fails** to improve atelectasis.  
7. In cases with **minimal secretions**, **positive-pressure airway therapy** (e.g., positive expiratory pressure devices) may be used to **recruit collapsed alveoli**.  
8. There is **no evidence** supporting the use of **mucolytics** such as **N-acetylcysteine** for the treatment of atelectasis.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Postoperative atelectasis is especially frequent after thoracic and abdominal surgeries.  
2. Pain and impaired mechanics discourage deep breathing and coughing, which normally clear secretions.  
3. Clinical and imaging findings may mimic pneumonia, but reflect collapse rather than infection.  
4. Pain relief, mobilization, and secretion clearance target the underlying contributors to collapse.  
5. Physiotherapy methods directly improve lung expansion and secretion clearance.  
6. Bronchoscopy is reserved for refractory cases, not as a first-line intervention.  
7. Positive expiratory pressure devices help open collapsed alveoli when secretions are not obstructive.  
8. N-acetylcysteine and similar mucolytics are not supported for this indication.
