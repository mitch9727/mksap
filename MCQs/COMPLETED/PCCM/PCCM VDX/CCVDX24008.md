#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Hypoxemic respiratory failure** is caused by **inadequate oxygenation of hemoglobin**.
2. **Shunt (ventilation–perfusion [V/Q] mismatch with V/Q = 0)** is the most common mechanism of **hypoxemic respiratory failure** and reflects **perfusion of nonventilated lung regions**.
3. The two main causes of **shunt** are **alveolar collapse (atelectasis)** and **alveolar filling with blood, cells, protein, or water**.
4. Less common causes of **shunt** include **fistulas** and **cardiac or pulmonary vessel malformations**.
5. A key feature of **shunt** is an **increased alveolar–arterial oxygen (A–a O₂) gradient** that is **not responsive to oxygen supplementation**.
6. The **alveolar gas equation** is: **Alveolar P_O₂ = (F_IO₂ × [P_atm − 47]) − (1.25 × P_CO₂)**.
7. The **calculated A–a O₂ gradient** should be **compared with the expected gradient** based on **age** and **fraction of inspired oxygen (F_IO₂)**.
8. **V/Q mismatch** (other than pure shunt) can also **increase the A–a O₂ gradient**, whereas **alveolar hypoventilation** produces **hypoxemia with a normal A–a O₂ gradient**.
9. Clinical features of **acute hypoxemic respiratory failure** include **recent onset of increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and anxiety**.
10. **Cyanosis of the lips and fingers** indicates **severely compromised hemoglobin oxygenation** in **acute hypoxemic respiratory failure**.
11. **Crackles, wheezing, egophony, or rhonchi** on auscultation may indicate **underlying causes** of **acute hypoxemic respiratory failure**.
12. **Clubbing** suggests **chronic diseases** such as **bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),** or **lung cancer**.
13. **Chest imaging** can help **identify the cause** of **acute respiratory failure**.
14. Treatment of **hypoxemic respiratory failure** includes **supplemental oxygen**, **mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)** to **open alveoli**, and, in **severe cases**, **extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)**.

15. After **smoke inhalation**, approximately **one third of patients** develop **airway edema** or **mucosal sloughing** caused by **epithelial necrosis**.
16. **Direct thermal injury** from **smoke inhalation** is usually **limited to the upper airways**, whereas **steam inhalation** can cause **thermal injury throughout the tracheobronchial tree**.
17. Following **smoke inhalation**, **early intubation, chest physiotherapy, and serial bronchoscopy** are frequently used to **facilitate airway clearance**.
18. **Chemical constituents of smoke** can injure the **distal airways and lung parenchyma**, causing **bronchoconstriction, pulmonary edema, V/Q mismatch, and bronchial cast formation**; **treatment is supportive**.
19. **Secondary infections** are common after **smoke inhalation**, and **pneumonia** is the **most frequent complication**, especially due to **Staphylococcus** and **Pseudomonas** species.
20. **Carbon monoxide** and **hydrogen cyanide** toxicities are **common after smoke exposure** and should be **suspected in all exposed patients**.
21. **Water‑soluble chemical vapors** predominantly affect the **upper airway** with **rapid symptom onset**, while **water‑insoluble vapors** more often affect the **lung parenchyma and distal airways** with **delayed symptoms**.
22. **Inhalational injuries from chemical vapors** commonly cause **edema, bronchospasm, asphyxiation, and direct systemic toxicity**; **treatment is supportive**.
23. In **cholinesterase inhibitor (organophosphate) exposure**, **high‑dose atropine** is administered **until bronchorrhea and bronchospasm are controlled**.
24. **E‑cigarette– or vaping‑associated lung injury (EVALI)** is linked to **vitamin E acetate** used to **thicken illicit vaping products**.
25. Suspicion for **EVALI** should be **high** in **e‑cigarette or vaping device users** with **hypoxemia**, **respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea)**, and **gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea)**, with possible **fever or chills**.
26. **Reported EVALI cases** have **declined sharply since 2019** after **public awareness increased** and **vitamin E acetate was removed** from affected products.
27. **EVALI treatment** is **supportive**; **empiric antibiotics** are often given if **infection cannot be ruled out**, and **systemic glucocorticoids** may be **useful in severe disease**.

28. **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** is defined by **acute hypoxemia** and **diffuse lung injury** due to an **inciting insult**, most commonly **sepsis** or **pneumonia**.
29. In **ARDS**, **surfactant disruption**, **vascular endothelial injury**, and **alveolar epithelial injury** lead to **fluid and protein extravasation**, **alveolar collapse**, **V/Q mismatch**, and **decreased lung compliance**.
30. **No specific diagnostic test** exists for **ARDS**; a **2023 global consensus definition** provides **diagnostic criteria**.
31. Patients with **ARDS** are at **high risk of mortality**, most often from **underlying disease, secondary infection, or multiorgan dysfunction** rather than **refractory hypoxemia**.

32. Most patients with **ARDS** are managed with **invasive mechanical ventilation**.
33. **Low tidal volume ventilation** and **PEEP** are **cornerstones of ARDS management** and are **associated with improved outcomes**.
34. **Heterogeneous lung involvement** in **ARDS** makes **compliant regions** susceptible to **overdistention (volutrauma)**, which is **mitigated by low tidal volumes**.
35. Guidelines recommend a **tidal volume of 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight** and a **plateau pressure <30 cm H₂O**, supported by evidence of an **11% absolute mortality reduction**.
36. **PEEP** prevents **atelectrauma** from **repetitive opening and closing** of distal airways and **improves V/Q matching** by **maintaining alveolar recruitment**.
37. There is **no universal optimal PEEP**; a **PEEP–F_IO₂ table** is used to **match PEEP to required F_IO₂** to maintain a **target oxygen saturation of 88%–95%**.
38. Guidelines **conditionally recommend higher PEEP** (but **not lung recruitment maneuvers**) for **moderate to severe ARDS**.
39. **Prone positioning** reduces **dependent lung compression**, improves **V/Q matching**, and **improves mortality** when used **early (within 48 hours)** with **low tidal volume ventilation** in patients with **P_aO₂/F_IO₂ <150 mm Hg**.
40. **Prone positioning** for **≥12–16 hours/day** should be **considered** for **severe ARDS** (defined as **P_aO₂/F_IO₂ <150 mm Hg** with **F_IO₂ ≥0.6**).
41. **Venovenous ECMO** is an **option** for **ARDS** unresponsive to **conventional management**; **early evaluation** for **ECMO appropriateness** is **recommended** in **severe ARDS**.
42. The following ventilator strategies **have not demonstrated a mortality benefit** in **ARDS**: **inverse‑ratio ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), esophageal pressure monitoring, driving pressure–guided PEEP titration,** and **high‑frequency oscillatory ventilation**.

43. **Light sedation** with **daily awakening**, **frequent reassessment**, and **minimization of mind‑altering medications** is recommended to **limit complications** of **sedative and opioid medications** in **ARDS/ICU care**.
44. **Systemic glucocorticoids** may **reduce mortality** in **moderate to severe ARDS** and are **conditionally recommended**.
45. A **conservative fluid strategy** in **ARDS** improves **oxygenation** and **reduces duration** of **mechanical ventilation** and **ICU stay** compared with a **liberal fluid strategy**.
46. In **ARDS** patients **without hypotension or organ hypoperfusion**, **protocol‑directed diuretics** and **minimal intravenous fluids** are recommended.
47. **Neuromuscular blocking agents** may **improve oxygenation** and **reduce ventilator‑induced lung injury** in **ARDS** but **should not be used routinely**.
48. Recent evidence shows **no significant 90‑day mortality difference** with **cisatracurium infusion** versus **lighter sedation** in **moderate to severe ARDS**, and there is a **trend toward increased ICU‑acquired weakness** with paralysis.
49. The following therapies are **not recommended** in **ARDS** due to **conflicting or limited evidence**: **nutritional modifications, vitamin C, macrolide antibiotics, inhaled nitric oxide, prostacyclin analogues, stem cells,** or **granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor (GM‑CSF)**.

50. **Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema** commonly presents with **hypoxemic respiratory failure**.
51. Patients with **acute respiratory failure** should be **evaluated for cardiogenic causes**, including **cardiomyopathy, mitral or aortic valve disease, myocardial ischemia,** and **arrhythmias** (particularly **atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate**).
52. Evaluation of suspected **acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema** includes **assessment of volume overload** (e.g., **jugular venous distention, S3, peripheral edema**), **electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **B‑type natriuretic peptide (BNP)** measurement, **serial serum troponins**, and **echocardiography**.
53. **Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema** typically **responds promptly** to **afterload and preload reduction** with **vasodilators or inodilators**; **diuretics** are used for **longer‑term fluid management**.
54. **Noninvasive positive‑pressure ventilation (PPV)** for **cardiogenic pulmonary edema** **hastens hypoxemia resolution**, **reduces preload and afterload**, **improves symptoms**, **lowers intubation rates**, and **decreases mortality** compared with **oxygen therapy alone**.

55. **Atelectasis** is a **common postoperative complication** due to **pain or impaired respiratory mechanics** that cause **shallow breathing** and **cough suppression**.
56. **Atelectasis** may be **asymptomatic** or present with **labored breathing**, **diminished basal breath sounds**, **egophony**, **rhonchi**, and **consolidation on imaging**.
57. **Management of atelectasis** includes **pain control**, **early mobility**, and **secretion management**.
58. **Respiratory physiotherapy** (e.g., **inspiratory muscle training, deep‑breathing exercise, mobility programs, percussion and vibration therapy**) **prevents and treats atelectasis**.
59. **Routine bronchoscopy** for **airway mucus clearance** offers **no clear benefit** compared with **other chest physiotherapy methods** and should be **reserved** when **24 hours** of **respiratory physiotherapy** **fails** to improve **atelectasis**.
60. When **secretions are minimal**, **positive‑pressure airway therapy** (e.g., **positive expiratory pressure devices**) may be **considered** to **recruit collapsed alveoli**.
61. There is **no evidence** supporting **mucolytics such as N‑acetylcysteine** for **atelectasis treatment**.

62. **Pneumonia** is a **common cause** of **respiratory failure** in the **ICU** and is the **most common cause of ARDS** that develops **outside the hospital**.
63. In patients with **appropriate clinical history**, **chest radiography** is the **standard diagnostic test** for **pneumonia**.
64. A **negative clinical examination or chest radiograph** does **not rule out community‑acquired pneumonia (CAP)** in **symptomatic patients**, especially **older adults**.
65. The **absence of typical features or focal infiltrates** on **chest radiograph** should **not delay early antibiotics** when **probability of CAP is high**.
66. Some **guidelines recommend glucocorticoids** for **severe CAP** in addition to **antimicrobial therapy**.

67. **Acute exacerbations of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD)**—particularly **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**—can occur **after inciting events** (e.g., **infection, procedures, drug reactions**) or **without an identifiable cause**.
68. Diagnostic **criteria for acute DPLD exacerbations** include **previous or concurrent DPLD**, **acute worsening of respiratory status (<1 month)**, and **new ground‑glass opacities on imaging**.
69. **Mortality** for **hypoxemic respiratory failure** due to **IPF exacerbation** **exceeds 50%**.
70. Most patients with **IPF exacerbation** are treated **empirically** with **antibiotics** and **high‑dose glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants**, but **evidence is insufficient** to define **dose, duration, or certainty of benefit**.
71. Outcomes after **intubation and mechanical ventilation** for **IPF exacerbation** are **very poor**, and **mortality can approach 100%**.
72. For **IPF exacerbation with hypoxemic respiratory failure**, clinicians should **discuss goals of care early**, **consider palliative care strategies**, and offer **ECMO only as a bridge** for **transplant‑eligible patients already listed** for **lung transplantation**.
