### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Diagnosis on Chest CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is associated with **bilateral, subpleural, and basal predominant reticular changes** on chest computed tomography (CT) scan.  
2. More advanced **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is associated with **traction bronchiectasis** and **fibrotic cystic changes** to the lungs.  
3. **Honeycombing** is the radiographic term for the **fibrotic cystic changes** seen in advanced interstitial lung diseases such as **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**.  
4. The presence of **honeycombing** is associated with a **poor prognosis** in interstitial lung disease.  
5. **Honeycombing** is a **pathologic finding** that is not specific to a single disease.  
6. **Respiratory bronchiolitis–interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD)** is characterized by **upper zone–predominant ground-glass opacities** with **fine centrilobular nodules**.  
7. **Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** is not typically associated with **honeycombing**.  
8. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is not typically associated with **honeycombing**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The findings described were demonstrated on chest CT scan in the presented case.  
2. The arrows in the provided CT image highlight the appearance of **honeycombing**.  
3. The term “honeycombing” refers to clustered cystic airspaces, usually of comparable diameters (3–10 mm but occasionally larger), typically subpleural and basal in distribution.

#### ✅ True Statements — Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
1. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is associated with the histopathologic pattern of **usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)** and is the most common idiopathic form of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD).  
2. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** typically presents with **chronic cough** and **dyspnea** in patients between ages **50 and 70 years**.  
3. Risk factors for **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** include **smoking**, **genetic factors**, and **male sex**.  
4. Patients with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** are often initially treated for **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** without improvement before the correct diagnosis is made.  
5. On lung examination, **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is associated with **bibasilar Velcro-like inspiratory crackles**.  
6. **Clubbing** is present in up to **50% of patients** with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
7. Chest radiographs in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** may demonstrate **bibasilar reticular changes**.  
8. High-resolution CT (HRCT) in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** shows **bilateral, subpleural, and basal predominant reticular changes**.  
9. Advanced cases of **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** may develop **traction bronchiectasis** with **honeycombing**.  
10. When HRCT findings are **classic for usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)**, **lung biopsy is not necessary** for diagnosis.  
11. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is progressive, with a **median survival of 3 to 5 years** after diagnosis.  
12. Patients with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** may experience **acute exacerbations** with rapidly worsening symptoms and development of **bilateral ground-glass opacities** superimposed on background fibrosis.  
13. No proven therapies exist for **acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**, although **glucocorticoids** and **antibiotics** are frequently used.  
14. Management of **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** should include consideration of **antifibrotic therapies** and **oxygen supplementation** for hypoxemia.  
15. **Nintedanib** and **pirfenidone** are approved antifibrotic medications for treatment of **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**.  
16. **Nintedanib** and **pirfenidone** demonstrate similar clinical responses by **slowing the rate of disease progression** in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
17. **Antifibrotic therapies** for **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** delay progression but are **not curative**.  
18. Referral to a **pulmonologist** or an **interstitial lung disease (ILD) center** is appropriate before initiating antifibrotic therapy in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**.  
19. Early referral to a **lung transplantation center** is strongly recommended for patients with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**, especially if medical therapy is ineffective.  
20. **Palliative care consultation** should be considered for patients with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** who are not candidates for lung transplantation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)** is the characteristic histopathologic pattern of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
11. The prognosis highlights the aggressive and irreversible nature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
12. Acute exacerbations may represent an acceleration of disease activity.  
15. **Nintedanib** is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and **pirfenidone** is an antifibrotic agent.  
19. Transplant referral is emphasized due to the unpredictable clinical course and poor prognosis.
