### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)** typically presents with **cough lasting weeks to months**, **fever**, and **malaise**.
2. **Initial chest radiographs** in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia show **patchy opacities** that **mimic pneumonia**, and patients are **often initially misdiagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia** and **treated with antibiotics**.
3. **Unresolving symptoms** and **failure to respond to antibiotics** should **raise suspicion** for **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia**.
4. **Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** is of **unknown etiology**.
5. **Secondary organizing pneumonia** can occur in association with **malignancy**, **drugs**, and **connective tissue diseases**.
6. **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** in organizing pneumonia demonstrates **ground-glass opacities** and/or **areas of alveolar consolidation** that **resemble infectious pneumonia**.
7. HRCT findings in **organizing pneumonia** can include **peripheral nodules** and **nodules along the bronchovascular bundle**.

#### 💬 Extra
6. In the provided CT example, **ground-glass opacities** are indicated by the **red arrow**, and **alveolar consolidation** is indicated by the **black arrow**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Organizing pneumonia** is defined histopathologically by **patchy proliferation of granulation tissue** affecting the **terminal bronchioles** and **alveolar ducts and spaces**, with **surrounding inflammation**.
2. The **organizing pneumonia** pattern is **nonspecific** and often **follows or is associated** with **acute infection**, **radiation exposure**, **drug-induced pneumonitis**, and **autoimmune diseases**.
3. When **no cause is identified**, the diagnosis is termed **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)**.
4. The diagnosis of **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** may **not require lung biopsy** when the **clinical presentation** and **high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** findings are **consistent** with COP.
5. In **atypical presentations**, **lung biopsy** helps make the **diagnosis** of **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia**.
6. **Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** **responds well to glucocorticoid therapy**.
7. **Relapses** of **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** during **glucocorticoid tapering** are **common** and warrant consideration of **glucocorticoid-sparing therapies**.
8. On **chest computed tomography (CT)**, **organizing pneumonia** can present with **bilateral patchy opacities with air bronchograms** that **mimic pneumonia**.

#### 💬 Extra
8. *Figure context:* The related CT image shows **bilateral patchy opacities with air bronchograms**; **transbronchial biopsies** from the **right middle lobe** revealed **organizing pneumonia**, and **opacities resolved with oral glucocorticoids**.
