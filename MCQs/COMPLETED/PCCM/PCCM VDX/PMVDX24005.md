### 🫁 Pulmonology: Variable Intrathoracic Airway Obstruction Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Variable intrathoracic airway obstruction** produces a **flow-volume curve with an expiratory plateau**.
2. The term **intrathoracic** in variable intrathoracic airway obstruction refers to the **airway below the thoracic inlet** where pleural pressure changes are transmitted.
3. In **variable intrathoracic airway obstruction**, **flow is impaired during expiration** because **positive pleural pressure during forced expiration narrows the intrathoracic airway**.
4. In **variable intrathoracic airway obstruction**, **flow is preserved during inspiration** because **negative pleural pressure during forced inspiration widens the intrathoracic airway**.
5. Causes of **variable intrathoracic airway obstruction** include **localized tumors of the lower trachea or mainstem bronchus**, a **large bronchogenic cyst**, **large mediastinal adenopathy**, **large thyroid goiter**, and **tracheobronchomalacia**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The expiratory plateau represents the hallmark physiologic pattern distinguishing intrathoracic obstruction from other flow-volume curve abnormalities.

#### ✅ True Statements — Pulmonary Function Testing Interpretation
1. Pulmonary function testing interpretation classifies abnormal results as **obstructive**, **restrictive**, or **mixed obstructive/restrictive**, and assesses the **severity of impairment**.
2. A **reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio** is consistent with **obstructive lung disease**.
3. The **American Thoracic Society (ATS)** and **European Respiratory Society (ERS)** define a reduced FEV₁/FVC ratio as **below the lower limit of normal**.
4. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)** defines a reduced FEV₁/FVC ratio as **below 0.70 on a postbronchodilator test**.
5. The 2021 **ATS/ERS technical standard** defines **bronchodilator responsiveness** as an **increase from baseline in FEV₁, FVC, or both of at least 10% relative to the predicted value**.
6. Many pulmonary function laboratories continue to use the **former thresholds** of a **12% and 200 mL increase** to define a significant bronchodilator response.
7. Measurement of **lung volumes** may help assess obstructive lung disease but is **not required for diagnosis**.
8. Elevation of **total lung capacity (TLC)** or **residual volume (RV)** to **≥120% of predicted** indicates **hyperinflation and air trapping**, which is common in **severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
9. If **FEV₁ or FVC is reduced** and the **FEV₁/FVC ratio is ≥0.70**, the pattern may be interpreted as **restrictive**, but measurement of **TLC** is needed to confirm restriction.
10. A **TLC <80% of predicted (or below the lower limit of normal)** confirms a **restrictive ventilatory defect**.
11. Some patients have **mixed obstructive and restrictive patterns**, such as those with **combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema**.
12. **Obesity** can reduce **FEV₁** and **FVC** while preserving the **FEV₁/FVC ratio**, and may cause modest reductions in **TLC** and **expiratory reserve volume**.
13. **Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO)** is reduced in conditions that **destroy, infiltrate, or remove alveolar-capillary units**, including **COPD**, **diffuse parenchymal lung disease**, and **lung resection**.
14. **DLCO** is also reduced in conditions that compromise alveolar-capillary function, including **pulmonary parenchymal and vascular disorders**.
15. **DLCO** is increased in conditions that **increase pulmonary capillary blood volume**, such as **pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage**, **left-to-right shunt**, and **asthma**.
16. The **flow-volume loop** is a graphical representation of **maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow (Y-axis)** against **volume (X-axis)**.
17. The **shape of the spirometric flow-volume loop** helps differentiate **obstructive from restrictive patterns** and can suggest the **anatomic location of airway obstruction**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. The new ATS/ERS criteria emphasize changes relative to the predicted value rather than absolute changes.
6. The 12% and 200 mL thresholds remain widely used in clinical practice despite updates.
8. Hyperinflation and air trapping reflect advanced airflow limitation and are hallmarks of severe COPD.
12. Obesity-related reductions are due to altered chest wall mechanics rather than intrinsic lung pathology.
15. Increased DLCO reflects enhanced pulmonary blood volume, not improved alveolar-capillary membrane function.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Characterization of Impairment Severity in Pulmonary Function Tests)
1. An FEV1 of 70% to 79% of predicted indicates **mild impairment**.
2. An FEV1 of 60% to 69% of predicted indicates **moderate impairment**.
3. An FEV1 of 50% to 59% of predicted indicates **moderately severe impairment**.
4. An FEV1 of 35% to 49% of predicted indicates **severe impairment**.
5. An FEV1 less than 35% of predicted indicates **very severe impairment**.
6. A diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) below the lower limit of normal but greater than 60% indicates **mild impairment**.
7. A Dlco of 40% to 60% of predicted indicates **moderate impairment**.
8. A Dlco less than 40% of predicted indicates **severe impairment**.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
6. The lower limit of normal for Dlco corresponds to the fifth percentile of healthy never-smokers.
