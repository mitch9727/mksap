### 🫁 Pulmonology: α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **α1-Antitrypsin deficiency** should be considered in all patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** who are **younger than 45 years**.
2. **α1-Antitrypsin deficiency** should be considered in patients with **COPD** who have a **strong family history of COPD**.
3. **α1-Antitrypsin deficiency** should be considered in patients with **COPD** who have **no identifiable COPD risk factors**.
4. **α1-Antitrypsin deficiency** is associated with a pattern of **basilar emphysema** on chest imaging.

#### 💬 Extra
4. On posteroanterior chest radiograph, **absence of lung markings in the lower lobes** is consistent with basilar emphysema and is suggestive of **α1-antitrypsin deficiency**.

#### ✅ True Statements — COPD Disease Assessment
1. Assessment of **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** includes determining the **severity of symptoms** and the **risk of acute exacerbation**.
2. Validated tools to assess **COPD symptom severity** include the **COPD Assessment Test (CAT)**, the **modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale**, the **St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire**, and the **Clinical COPD Questionnaire**.
3. The **Clinical COPD Questionnaire** is also used to **screen for COPD symptoms**.
4. Factors that predict a **high risk of recurrent COPD exacerbations** include **FEV1 less than 50% of predicted**, **two or more acute exacerbations in the past year**, and **a history of hospitalization for an acute exacerbation**.
5. A formal assessment of **COPD disease severity** can be obtained using the **GOLD model**, which incorporates **symptom severity (CAT or mMRC)** and **history of acute exacerbations**.
6. The **COPD Assessment Test (CAT)** has a **total score range of 0 to 40**, with **higher scores indicating greater symptom severity**.
7. The degree of **airflow obstruction** measured by **spirometry** and the presence of **comorbid conditions** are additional markers of **COPD disease severity**.
8. Clinicians should assess for **comorbidities associated with COPD** because they indicate **higher morbidity and mortality** and require appropriate treatment.
9. **Pulse oximetry at rest and with exertion** should be used in COPD to determine the **need for supplemental oxygen**.
10. **Arterial blood gases** should be measured in COPD to assess for **hypercapnia** in patients with **low FEV1**, **change in mental status**, **acute exacerbation**, **elevated serum bicarbonate level**, or **oxygen saturation less than 92%** on pulse oximetry.
11. An **α1-antitrypsin level** should be obtained **once in all patients with COPD**.
12. A **pattern of basilar emphysema**, **associated liver disease**, **panniculitis**, or a **strong family history of emphysema** in patients with COPD suggests possible **α1-antitrypsin deficiency**.
13. Clinical features such as **basilar emphysema**, **liver disease**, **panniculitis**, or **family history** are **not sufficiently sensitive to rule out α1-antitrypsin deficiency without testing**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. The GOLD model combines symptom scores with exacerbation history to stratify severity and direct therapy.
11. Screening for **α1-antitrypsin deficiency** is universal in COPD, regardless of risk factors.
13. Diagnostic testing is required because clinical predictors alone lack sensitivity.

### 📘 Supplemental Table Derivations

#### ✅ True Statements — CAT™ Assessment
1. The **COPD Assessment Test (CAT)** includes **eight symptom domains**: cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence leaving home, sleep, and energy.
2. The **COPD Assessment Test (CAT)** uses a **0 to 5 scale per item**, with higher scores reflecting **worse symptoms**.
3. The **COPD Assessment Test (CAT)** total score ranges from **0 to 40**, with **higher values indicating greater disease burden**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Classification of COPD Severity by GOLD Patient Category
4. In the **GOLD classification**, **Category A** is defined as **≤1 exacerbation per year without hospitalization**, **CAT <10**, and **mMRC 0–1**.
5. In the **GOLD classification**, **Category B** is defined as **≤1 exacerbation per year without hospitalization**, **CAT ≥10**, or **mMRC ≥2**.
6. In the **GOLD classification**, **Category E** is defined as **≥2 exacerbations per year** or **≥1 exacerbation requiring hospitalization**, regardless of **CAT or mMRC scores**.
