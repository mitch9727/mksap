### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Chest CT Findings in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Multiple **sharply defined areas of low attenuation** on chest computed tomography (CT) are characteristic of **centrilobular emphysema**.  
2. **Paraseptal emphysema** and **bullae** on chest CT are consistent with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.  
3. The diagnosis of **COPD** is made in the setting of an **appropriate clinical history** with **spirometric documentation of airflow obstruction**.  
4. **Radiography, including chest CT**, plays an **adjunctive role** in the evaluation of COPD.  
5. Chest CT is useful when the **diagnosis of COPD is unclear**.  
6. Chest CT is useful in patients with COPD who have **worsening symptoms** suggestive of a **complication**, such as **infection** or **pneumothorax**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Centrilobular emphysema typically involves destruction of the central portion of the secondary pulmonary lobule, often associated with smoking.  
2. Paraseptal emphysema involves the distal acinus and subpleural regions and may be associated with spontaneous pneumothorax.  
3. Spirometry confirms obstruction when the post-bronchodilator **FEV1/FVC ratio** is <0.70.  
4. Imaging findings alone are not diagnostic of COPD and must be correlated with clinical and physiologic data.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The possibility of **COPD** should be considered and **spirometry performed** in patients with **progressive dyspnea**, **chronic cough with or without sputum production**, or **recurrent lower respiratory tract infections**, especially in the presence of **risk factors** such as **smoking**.  
2. The role of **screening spirometry** in **asymptomatic individuals with risk factors** for COPD is **controversial**.  
3. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **against screening** for COPD in **asymptomatic adults**.  
4. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report** suggests **performing screening spirometry** in individuals with **risk factors for COPD**.  
5. In the appropriate clinical context, **COPD is diagnosed using spirometry** to document **airflow obstruction**.  
6. **COPD is confirmed** by a **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70**.  
7. In **asthma**, airflow obstruction is **reversible with bronchodilator therapy**, which differs from COPD.  
8. **Measuring lung volumes and diffusing capacity** is **not required** to diagnose COPD but may help to **determine disease severity**.  
9. Clinicians should **rule out other causes** of **chronic respiratory symptoms**, including **heart failure**, **bronchiectasis**, **obliterative bronchiolitis**, **tuberculosis**, and **diffuse panbronchiolitis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. COPD risk factors most commonly include **smoking**, but environmental exposures and genetic predisposition may also play a role.  
2. USPSTF and GOLD differ on the role of screening, reflecting varying emphases on cost-effectiveness versus early detection.  
7. Reversibility with bronchodilator therapy is a key physiologic distinction between **asthma** and **COPD**.  
9. The differential diagnosis underscores that **chronic respiratory symptoms** can arise from both **obstructive** and **non-obstructive** conditions.
