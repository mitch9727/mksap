### 🫁 Pulmonology: Cystic Fibrosis Radiographic Findings

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cystic fibrosis (CF)** in adults often presents with **pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms**.
2. Pulmonary manifestations of **cystic fibrosis** include **chronic productive cough**, **recurrent sinusitis**, and **recurrent pulmonary infections** requiring repeated courses of antibiotics.
3. Chest radiography findings consistent with **cystic fibrosis** include **diffusely thickened bronchial walls** and **pairs of parallel linear opacities (“tram tracks”)**, which are consistent with **bronchiectasis**.
4. Chest radiography findings consistent with **cystic fibrosis** include **diffusely distributed patchy areas of airspace consolidation** and **mild hyperinflation of the chest**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Recurrent pulmonary infections in **cystic fibrosis** often necessitate frequent antibiotic treatment.
3. The appearance of “tram tracks” on chest radiography represents thickened, dilated bronchi characteristic of **bronchiectasis**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis
1. Most patients with **cystic fibrosis (CF)** are diagnosed in childhood.
2. Adults with **cystic fibrosis** most often present with **pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms**.
3. Gastrointestinal manifestations of **cystic fibrosis** include **loose and frequent stools with abdominal pain**.
4. **Pancreatic insufficiency** may occur in **cystic fibrosis** but is less common in adults.
5. More than **95% of men with cystic fibrosis** are **infertile**, most commonly due to **absence of the vas deferens**.
6. Failure to include **cystic fibrosis** in the differential diagnosis is a major challenge in diagnosis.
7. **Family history of cystic fibrosis** should raise suspicion for the disease in patients with persistent pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms.
8. Radiographic findings in **cystic fibrosis** include **hyperinflation**, followed by **bronchiectasis** and **cyst formation** with disease progression, often beginning in the **upper lobes**.
9. **Sweat chloride testing** is a primary diagnostic tool for **cystic fibrosis** because of increased chloride concentration in sweat gland secretions.
10. **Sweat chloride testing** is less sensitive in **adults** than in **children**.
11. Abnormal results on **repeat sweat chloride testing** are diagnostic of **cystic fibrosis**.
12. **Genetic testing** confirms the diagnosis of **cystic fibrosis** and provides prognostic information.
13. A negative **sweat chloride test** in an adult does not exclude **cystic fibrosis**.
14. Adults with high clinical suspicion for **cystic fibrosis** and negative **repeat sweat chloride tests** should be referred to a **cystic fibrosis specialty center** or considered for **genetic testing**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Loose and frequent stools with abdominal pain in **cystic fibrosis** reflect gastrointestinal involvement such as malabsorption.
5. Absence of the vas deferens is the most common cause of infertility in men with **cystic fibrosis**.
9. Elevated chloride concentration in sweat is a pathophysiologic hallmark of **cystic fibrosis**.
13. Diagnostic evaluation in **cystic fibrosis** should not rely on a single negative sweat chloride test in adults.
