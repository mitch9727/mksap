### 🫁 Pulmonology: Left Mainstem Bronchus Obstruction

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Left mainstem endobronchial obstruction** is most often caused by a **tumor**.
2. **Left upper lobe atelectasis** can appear on chest radiographs as an **ill-defined opacification** at the **left hilum** and **left upper lung field**.
3. **Hilum displacement laterally and superiorly** is a radiographic sign of **left upper lobe atelectasis**.
4. **Tracheal deviation to the left** is a radiographic finding in **left upper lobe atelectasis**.
5. **Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm** indicates **loss of volume** in the **left upper lobe**.
6. The **absence of the normally visible lucency** of the **left mainstem bronchus** may indicate **obstruction**.
7. On **lateral chest radiograph**, **anterior displacement of the major fissure** is consistent with **left upper lobe atelectasis**.
8. **Opacification of the left upper lung field** is a characteristic radiographic feature of **left upper lobe atelectasis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Obstruction of the **left mainstem bronchus** is a potential cause of **left upper lobe atelectasis**.
6. The absence of bronchial lucency can reflect blockage by **tumor, mucus plug, or aspirated material**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Other Pulmonary Neoplasms
1. **Carcinoid tumors** are **low-grade neoplasms** comprised of **neuroendocrine cells** and account for **1% to 2% of all lung cancers**.
2. **Smoking** is not clearly a **risk factor** for **carcinoid tumors**.
3. **Carcinoid tumors** arise in the **proximal airways** and most often cause symptoms of an **obstructing mass** such as **cough, dyspnea, or monophonic wheezing**, or symptoms of **bleeding**.
4. **Bronchial obstruction** due to **carcinoid tumors** may cause **lobar atelectasis** and **recurrent pneumonia** in the same pulmonary segment or lobe.
5. **Carcinoid tumors** may initially be misdiagnosed as **asthma** or **pneumonia**, leading to a **delay in diagnosis**.
6. **Lung carcinoid tumors** are rarely associated with **carcinoid syndrome**.
7. **Surgical resection** of **carcinoid tumors** is often **curative**, with **10-year survival rates exceeding 90%**.
8. **Adenoid cystic carcinoma** is a **salivary gland tumor** that occurs in the **lower respiratory tract** and accounts for **<1% of all lung cancers**.
9. **Surgical resection** is the **preferred treatment** for **adenoid cystic carcinoma**.
10. **Hamartomas** are the **most common benign lung neoplasms** and are composed of **cartilage, connective tissue, smooth muscle, fat, and respiratory epithelium**.
11. On imaging, **hamartomas** often appear as **smooth-bordered nodules** that may demonstrate **“popcorn” calcification** or contain **fat**.
12. The **lung** is a frequent site of **metastatic disease** from other cancers, including **head and neck, colon, kidney, breast, thyroid, and melanoma**.
13. **Metastatic lung disease** can present as **solitary or multiple nodules**, **lymphangitic spread**, or as **endobronchial, pleural, or embolic lesions**.
14. **Surgical resection** may be appropriate for a **solitary pulmonary metastasis** if there is **no evidence of other metastatic disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. The predominant clinical manifestations of **carcinoid tumors** are due to their **endobronchial location**.
7. Long-term survival following **surgical resection of carcinoid tumors** is favorable compared with most other lung cancers.
10. **Hamartomas** are rare compared to malignant lung tumors but remain the most common **benign** neoplasm.
12. The wide variety of primary cancers that metastasize to the lung underscores the importance of considering **secondary malignancy** in lung nodules.
