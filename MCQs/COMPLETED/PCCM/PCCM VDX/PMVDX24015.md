### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Fixed Upper Airway Obstruction (Flow-Volume Curve)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **flow-volume curve with both an inspiratory and an expiratory plateau** indicates a physiologic pattern of **fixed upper airway obstruction**.
2. The term **upper airway** refers to the **airway above the level of the carina**, which includes the **trachea** and the **larynx**.
3. In fixed upper airway obstruction, the **similar magnitude of the flow rates during inspiration and expiration** demonstrates that the obstruction is fixed and does not vary with the respiratory cycle.
4. A **tracheal stricture** composed of inflexible fibrotic tissue is an example of a **fixed upper airway obstruction**.
5. A **variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction** produces a **plateau of the inspiratory limb** of the flow-volume curve but not the expiratory limb.
6. A **variable intrathoracic upper airway obstruction** produces a **plateau of the expiratory limb** of the flow-volume curve but not the inspiratory limb.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Plateauing of both inspiratory and expiratory limbs is the hallmark of fixed lesions such as tracheal stenosis.  
5. Variable extrathoracic obstructions include conditions like vocal cord dysfunction.  
6. Variable intrathoracic obstructions include intrathoracic tracheomalacia.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Pulmonary function testing interpretation classifies abnormal results as **obstructive**, **restrictive**, or **mixed obstructive/restrictive** and assesses severity of impairment.  
2. A **reduced FEV1/FVC ratio** is consistent with **obstruction**.  
3. Severity of **obstruction** is determined according to the **measured FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value**.  
4. The **American Thoracic Society (ATS)** and **European Respiratory Society (ERS)** define a reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** as **below the lower limit of normal**.  
5. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)** defines a reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** as **below 0.70** on a **postbronchodilator test**.  
6. In 2021, the **ATS/ERS technical standard** changed bronchodilator responsiveness criteria to an **increase from baseline in FEV1, FVC, or both of at least 10% relative to the predicted value**.  
7. Many laboratories still use the **former bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds** of **12% and 200 mL** increase.  
8. Measurement of **lung volumes** may help assess **obstructive lung disease** but is not necessary for diagnosis.  
9. **Elevation of total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (≥120% of predicted)** indicates **hyperinflation and air trapping**, a common pattern in **severe COPD**.  
10. If **FEV1 or FVC is reduced** and the **FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.70**, then the pattern may be interpreted as **restrictive**.  
11. Measurement of **TLC <80% of predicted (or below lower limit of normal)** confirms the presence of **restrictive disease**.  
12. **Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema** can produce both a **low TLC (restrictive)** and **low FEV1/FVC ratio (obstructive)**.  
13. **Obesity** often results in **reduced FEV1 and FVC**, with a **preserved FEV1/FVC ratio** and modest reduction in **TLC and expiratory reserve volume**.  
14. The **diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco)** is reduced in conditions with **destruction, infiltration, removal, or dysfunction** of alveolar-capillary units, such as **COPD, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, lung resection, or pulmonary vascular disease**.  
15. The **Dlco** is elevated in conditions that **increase pulmonary capillary blood volume**, such as **pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, left-to-right shunt, or asthma**.  
16. The **flow-volume loop** is a **graphic representation** of **maximally forced inspiratory and expiratory flow (Y-axis)** against **volume (X-axis)**.  
17. The **shape of the spirometric flow-volume loop** can help differentiate **obstructive from restrictive patterns** and suggest the **anatomic location of airway obstruction**.  

#### 💬 Extra
6. The change from 12%/200 mL to 10% relative to predicted reflects evolving ATS/ERS criteria for bronchodilator response.  
9. Hyperinflation and air trapping are hallmark findings in advanced COPD physiology.  
13. Obesity-related reductions in lung volumes mimic restriction but typically preserve FEV1/FVC ratio.  
15. Increased Dlco in asthma reflects increased pulmonary blood volume rather than parenchymal damage.
