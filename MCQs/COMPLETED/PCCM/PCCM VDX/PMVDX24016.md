### 🫁 Pulmonology: Empyema Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **parapneumonic effusion** is a pleural effusion associated with **bacterial pneumonia**.
2. **Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions** are typically **small, sterile, and free-flowing**, and they resolve with treatment of pneumonia.
3. **Complicated parapneumonic effusions** occur with **significant pleural inflammation** or when **bacteria invade the pleural space**.
4. An **empyema** is defined as a **bacterial infection of the pleural space**, which results in **purulent pleural fluid** or a **positive Gram stain**.
5. On **computed tomography (CT) imaging**, empyema is characterized by **pleural enhancement around the effusion** creating a **lenticular-shaped opacity**.
6. A **lung abscess** is an **intraparenchymal process**, often containing an **air–fluid level**, and it has **thickened, irregular walls**, in contrast to empyema.

#### 💬 Extra
5. The **arrows in the CT image** highlight the **pleural enhancement and lenticular shape** typical of empyema.

#### ✅ True Statements — Parapneumonic Effusion and Empyema
1. A **parapneumonic effusion** can be **uncomplicated** (sterile and free-flowing) or **complicated** (infected or loculated).
2. **Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions** are typically **small**, resolve with treatment of pneumonia, and are associated with **pleural fluid pH >7.2 (often >7.4)**, **glucose >60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L)**, and **lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) <900 U/L**.
3. **Complicated parapneumonic effusions** show **low pleural fluid pH**, **low glucose**, and **high LDH**.
4. **Pleural fluid cultures** identify pathogens in only **56% of empyema cases**.
5. **Complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema** usually require **drainage**.
6. **Drainage is required** if pleural fluid contains **frank pus**, a **positive Gram stain or culture**, or has a **pH <7.2**.
7. **Drainage may be considered** for effusions with **pH 7.2–7.4** if **LDH >900 U/L**.
8. **Drainage options** for complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema include **thoracostomy tube drainage** and **video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)**, generally combined with **intrapleural fibrinolytics (tissue plasminogen activator)** and a **mucolytic agent (deoxyribonuclease)**.
9. **Early intervention** improves outcomes in complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema.
10. A **multidisciplinary team approach** helps guide treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema.
11. In **community-acquired pleural infections**, common pathogens include **Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus**, and the **Streptococcus anginosus group**.
12. In **hospital-acquired empyema**, **methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** and **Enterobacteriaceae** are more prevalent.
13. **Anaerobic bacteria** are cultured in more than **20% of pleural space infections**.
14. **Polymicrobial infections** are common in pleural space infection.
15. **Empiric antibiotic regimens** for pleural infection should include **coverage for anaerobes**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. These pleural fluid cutoffs (pH, glucose, LDH) distinguish uncomplicated from complicated parapneumonic effusions.  
4. Negative cultures are common even when empyema is present.  
8. The combination of fibrinolytic and mucolytic agents helps break down septations and improve drainage.  
11. Community-acquired infections reflect typical respiratory flora.  
12. Nosocomial infections reflect higher prevalence of resistant and gram-negative organisms.  
13. Anaerobes are often associated with aspiration pneumonia or the anaerobic environment of the pleural space.  
15. Empiric regimens are given before culture results are available to ensure adequate early coverage.
