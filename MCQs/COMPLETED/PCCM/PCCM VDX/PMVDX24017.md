### 🫀 Pulmonary Medicine: Asbestosis — Chest CT Findings

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Asbestosis** is a slowly progressive, diffuse **pulmonary fibrosis** caused by inhalation of **asbestos fibers**.  
2. **Calcified pleural plaques** are evidence of prior **asbestos** exposure and can be detected on chest imaging.  
3. **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** often shows **pleural thickening** and **subpleural linear densities** parallel to the pleura in **asbestosis**.  
4. **Basilar lung parenchymal fibrosis** with **peribronchiolar, intralobular, and interlobular septal fibrosis** is a characteristic HRCT pattern in **asbestosis**.  
5. **Parenchymal bands** and **curvilinear opacities** on chest CT are imaging findings associated with **asbestosis**.  
6. The latency period between initial **asbestos** exposure and symptomatic **asbestosis** is commonly **20 to 30 years**.  
7. Diagnosis of **asbestosis** requires all of the following: evidence of **asbestos exposure** (for example, calcified pleural plaques), an **appropriate latency period**, a **compatible clinical presentation** (progressive dyspnea and reduced lung volumes and/or reduced diffusing capacity), and **consistent imaging results**.  
8. Imaging assessment for suspected **asbestosis** typically includes thin-section chest CT (HRCT) to evaluate pleural and subpleural disease.

#### 💬 Extra
2. The provided bone-window image demonstrates **calcified pleural plaques** (left panel, yellow arrows) that serve as objective evidence of prior asbestos exposure.  
3. The provided CT (right panel, red arrow) shows **diffuse pleural thickening** consistent with the pleural component of asbestos-related disease.  
5. The provided CT (right panel, black arrow) shows **parenchymal bands** and **curvilinear opacities** at the lung bases consistent with asbestosis-related parenchymal fibrosis.  
7. The listed diagnostic requirements (exposure, latency, compatible symptoms, and consistent imaging) are conjunctive — all contribute to establishing the diagnosis rather than any single feature alone.
