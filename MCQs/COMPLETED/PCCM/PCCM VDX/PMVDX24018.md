### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Arteriovenous Malformation on Chest Radiography

#### ✅ True Statements
1. An **arteriovenous malformation (AVM)** may appear on chest radiography as a **smooth, sharply circumscribed, homogeneous nodular lesion**.
2. A **3-cm nodular lesion** at the **base of the right lung** without **hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy** is consistent with an **arteriovenous malformation**.
3. **Nodular lung lesions** may be caused by **bronchogenic carcinoma** or **metastatic cancer**, but in a **young nonsmoking patient**, a **congenital or developmental lesion** such as an **arteriovenous malformation** is more likely.
4. **Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT)** can confirm the diagnosis of an **arteriovenous malformation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Smooth and homogeneous density on radiography helps distinguish AVMs from irregular or spiculated malignant lesions.
2. The absence of lymphadenopathy reduces suspicion for malignant causes.
3. Patient demographics (age ≤25 years, nonsmoker) strongly favor congenital lesions rather than malignancy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. On imaging, **pulmonary nodules** are defined as **small opacities <3 cm** surrounded by normal lung parenchyma, whereas a **focal opacity >3 cm** is considered a **lung mass** and presumed malignant until proved otherwise.
2. **Pulmonary nodules** are frequently detected **incidentally** because of the high use of **chest CT** for other indications.
3. **Lung masses (>3 cm)** should be presumed **malignant until proved otherwise**.
4. When multiple pulmonary nodules are present, **follow-up is determined by the largest lesion**.
5. A **well-demarcated, centrally or fully calcified nodule** usually represents a **previous infectious granuloma** and is considered **benign**.
6. Common infectious causes of **benign granulomatous nodules** include **endemic fungi** (e.g., histoplasmosis) and **mycobacteria** (e.g., tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria).
7. **Subsolid nodules**, including **pure ground-glass** and **part-solid nodules**, often represent **premalignant adenocarcinoma in situ** and may grow very slowly, with doubling times between **400–800 days**.
8. **Development or growth of a solid component** in a **subsolid nodule** suggests **malignancy**.
9. **Subsolid nodules** are not reliably characterized by **PET/CT**, and **nonsurgical biopsies** have limited sensitivity.
10. The **Brock model** and similar prediction calculators estimate malignancy risk based on factors such as **age, sex, smoking history, nodule size, lung location, and border morphology**.
11. **Solid nodules >8 mm** with moderate risk should be further characterized with **PET/CT**, with management based on results.
12. **Solid nodules >8 mm** with high risk should be staged with **PET/CT** followed by **definitive management** (e.g., resection, chemotherapy, radiation).

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Recommendations for Single Pulmonary Nodule Follow-Up)
1. For **incidentally detected pulmonary nodules <6 mm** in **low-risk patients**, **no follow-up** is required.
2. For **incidentally detected pulmonary nodules <6 mm** in **high-risk patients**, **optional chest CT at 12 months** may be performed.
3. For **6–8 mm pulmonary nodules** in **low-risk patients**, **chest CT at 6–12 months** is recommended, with optional **chest CT at 18–24 months**.
4. For **6–8 mm pulmonary nodules** in **high-risk patients**, **chest CT at 6–12 months** and **again at 18–24 months** is recommended.
5. For **pulmonary nodules >8 mm** in any patient, evaluation should include **chest CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling**.

  <figcaption>
    <strong>Radiographic Evolution of Part-Solid Pulmonary Nodule.</strong>  
    Radiographs show a part-solid, part–ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe (A); growth in the solid component at 1 year (B); an increase in the ground-glass component at 4 years (C); and further growth of the solid component at 6 years (D). This slow growth pattern is characteristic of part-solid nodules progressing from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma.
