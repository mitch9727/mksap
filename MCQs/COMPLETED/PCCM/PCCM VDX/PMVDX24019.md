### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Right Upper Lobe Endobronchial Carcinoma Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Right upper lobe endobronchial carcinoma commonly causes lobar atelectasis by obstructing a bronchus.
2. Lobar atelectasis can also be caused by a mucus plug or aspirated material.
3. Chest radiographs showing homogeneous, sharply demarcated opacification in the right upper chest with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and displacement of the right hilum are consistent with right upper lobe atelectasis.

#### 💬 Extra
3. The lateral chest radiograph may show opacification of the upper lung field in right upper lobe atelectasis.

#### ✅ True Statements — Other Pulmonary Neoplasms
1. Carcinoid tumors are low-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms that account for 1% to 2% of all lung cancers.
2. Smoking is not clearly a risk factor for lung carcinoid tumors.
3. Lung carcinoid tumors arise in the proximal airways and often present with cough, dyspnea, monophonic wheezing, or bleeding due to an obstructing mass.
4. Bronchial obstruction from carcinoid tumors can cause lobar atelectasis and recurrent pneumonia in the same pulmonary segment or lobe.
5. Lung carcinoid tumors may be initially misdiagnosed as asthma or pneumonia, leading to delayed diagnosis.
6. Lung carcinoid tumors are rarely associated with carcinoid syndrome.
7. Surgical resection of a lung carcinoid tumor is often curative, and 10-year survival rates exceed 90%.
8. Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lower respiratory tract accounts for less than 1% of all lung cancers, and surgical resection is the preferred treatment.
9. Pulmonary hamartomas are the most common benign lung neoplasm and are composed of cartilage, connective tissue, smooth muscle, fat, and respiratory epithelium.
10. Pulmonary hamartomas appear on imaging as smooth-bordered nodules that may show “popcorn” calcification or contain fat.
11. The lung is a frequent site for metastatic disease from malignancies such as head and neck, colon, kidney, breast, thyroid, and melanoma.
12. Metastatic disease to the lung may present as solitary nodules, multiple nodules, lymphangitic spread, endobronchial lesions, pleural lesions, or embolic lesions.
13. Surgical resection may be appropriate for a solitary pulmonary metastasis if there is no evidence of other metastatic disease.
