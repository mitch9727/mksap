### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP)** results from repetitive inhalation of antigens, typically complex proteins, in a sensitized person.  
2. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis** produces an immunologic response characterized by **noncaseating granulomas** and **peribronchial mononuclear cell infiltration with giant cells**.  
3. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis** is classified as **fibrotic** or **nonfibrotic** based on **radiologic and histopathologic features**.  
4. In **nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis**, CT scans typically show **diffuse parenchymal infiltration** (ground-glass opacities, mosaic attenuation) and **small airways disease** (centrilobular nodules, air trapping).  
5. In **fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis**, imaging demonstrates **reticular abnormalities** and/or **ground-glass opacities with architectural distortion**, including **traction bronchiectasis**, **volume loss**, and **honeycombing**.  
6. **Chest radiography** in hypersensitivity pneumonitis may demonstrate **diffuse micronodular disease** but may also appear **normal**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. (True Statement 4) The CT scan in this case shows **patchy, bilateral ground-glass opacities** and **centrilobular micronodules** in the mid-lung, consistent with nonfibrotic HP.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Repetitive inhalation of **specific antigens** in sensitized individuals can result in **hypersensitivity pneumonitis**.  
2. Antigens that cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis may include **agricultural dust**, **thermophilic fungi**, **bacteria**, and **low-molecular-weight organic compounds**.  
3. Symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis are **nonspecific**, including **dyspnea**, **cough**, **chest tightness**, **fever**, and **weight loss**.  
4. A **careful exposure history** is essential for identifying potential antigens in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  
5. **Serologic testing** in hypersensitivity pneumonitis is often limited, nonstandardized, and may not include antibodies to the responsible antigen.  
6. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis was historically classified as **acute, subacute, or chronic**, but recent guidelines classify it as **fibrotic or nonfibrotic** based on **radiologic or histopathologic features**.  
7. Findings suggestive of **fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis** include **reticular abnormalities**, **ground-glass opacity with architectural distortion**, **traction bronchiectasis**, **volume loss**, **honeycombing**, and evidence of **bronchiolar obstruction**.  
8. Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis often requires **multidisciplinary discussion** of **clinical, radiologic, and bronchoalveolar lavage findings**.  
9. If a confident diagnosis cannot be made despite suspicion, **histopathology with transbronchial lung biopsy** may establish the diagnosis but is often unnecessary.  
10. **Removal of exposure** to the offending antigen is essential in the treatment of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  
11. Patients with **mild disease** may be monitored after antigen removal to assess for improvement.  
12. **Immunosuppressive therapy** with **glucocorticoids** or other immunosuppressants is frequently used in more severe hypersensitivity pneumonitis, though supporting data are limited.  
13. **Antifibrotic therapy** may be considered for patients with **fibrosis on imaging**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Antigen exposures are commonly occupational or environmental, such as **farmer’s lung** (moldy hay) or **bird fancier’s lung** (avian proteins).  
8. Multidisciplinary teams may include pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists to ensure diagnostic confidence.  
12. Immunosuppressive use is based largely on clinical experience rather than robust randomized trial data.
