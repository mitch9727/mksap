#### ✅ True Statements — Epidemiology of COPD
1. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is a chronic lung disease defined by chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway abnormalities that cause persistent airflow obstruction.  
2. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** affects more than 6% of the U.S. population and approximately 10% of the global population.  
3. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.  
4. The **World Health Organization (WHO)** predicts that by 2030, COPD will be the fifth most prevalent disorder and the third leading cause of death worldwide.

#### ✅ True Statements — Pathophysiology of COPD
1. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is an inflammatory condition triggered by cigarette smoke and other irritants that activate macrophages and epithelial cells within the respiratory tract.  
2. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, epithelial cells release neutrophil chemotactic factors, and macrophages and recruited neutrophils release proteases that destroy lung parenchyma.  
3. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, proteases are normally inactivated by antiproteases such as **α1-antitrypsin**, but protease levels are increased.  
4. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, oxidative stress from irritants and inflammatory cells contributes to additional inflammation and tissue destruction.  
5. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** causes fibrosis of the small airways, reduced elastic recoil of the lungs, static hyperinflation, and abnormally elevated mucin concentrations.  
6. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, increasing airway inflammation worsens airflow obstruction, reduces the ability to exhale fully, and produces dynamic hyperinflation (air trapping).  
7. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, hyperinflation appears radiographically as an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and flattening of the diaphragm.  
8. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, diaphragmatic flattening limits the ability to increase breath volume during exertion.  
9. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, compensatory use of accessory muscles and an increased respiratory rate augment minute ventilation, increase the work of breathing, and contribute to dyspnea.  

#### 💬 Extra — Pathophysiology of COPD
6. Dynamic hyperinflation occurs when inhalation begins before exhalation is completed.

#### ✅ True Statements — GOLD Pharmacologic Management
1. **GOLD Group A** therapy for **COPD** is a **short-acting bronchodilator or a long-acting bronchodilator**, with ongoing evaluation for benefit.

3. **GOLD Group E** therapy for **COPD** is **LABA + LAMA**, with consideration of **LABA + LAMA + ICS** when **eosinophils ≥300/µL** or when asthma features are present.
4. For **COPD** with **persistent exacerbations** despite guideline therapy, additional options include **roflumilast** (for **FEV₁ &lt;50% with chronic bronchitis**), **long-term macrolide therapy** (best evidence for **azithromycin**), or **dupilumab** in **chronic bronchitis**.

### 💬 Extra — COPD Treatments
1. The **adverse effects** listed are **dose related** and reflect typical class pharmacology.  
4. The caution against **combining short- and long-acting anticholinergics** avoids **therapeutic duplication**.  
7. The **fatality risk** from long-acting β₂-agonist overdose reflects **sympathomimetic toxicity**.  
13. **Roflumilast** should not be combined with **methylxanthines** due to overlapping **phosphodiesterase inhibition toxicity**.  
18. Combination inhalers must be used carefully to **avoid duplicate exposure** (e.g., short + long anticholinergic).  
19. The **dupilumab eosinophil threshold (≥300/µL)** is derived from guideline-based biologic use criteria.
