### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (Chest Radiography)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Chest radiographs in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** may demonstrate **bibasilar-predominant septal line thickening** with **reticular changes** and **volume loss**.  
2. **Bronchiectasis changes** may be seen on chest radiography in **severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**.  
3. The best diagnostic test for **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** is **high-resolution CT (HRCT)**.  
4. **High-resolution CT (HRCT)** in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may show **bilateral-, peripheral-, and basal-predominant septal line thickening** with **honeycomb changes**.  
5. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis typically presents between **50 and 70 years of age**.  
6. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis typically presents with a **greater than 6-month duration** of **dry cough** and **dyspnea on exertion**.  
7. Lung examination in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** is notable for **“Velcro” inspiratory crackles** that are **predominant at the bases**.  
8. **Clubbing** is present in up to **50% of patients** with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Septal line thickening and reticular changes reflect fibrotic remodeling in the lung bases.  
3. HRCT is preferred because it detects hallmark findings such as honeycombing with greater sensitivity than chest radiography.  
7. “Velcro” crackles are a classic auscultatory finding in fibrotic lung disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is associated with the histopathologic pattern of **usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)**.  
2. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is the most common idiopathic form of **diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD)**.  
3. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis reflects **dysregulated fibrosis** in response to **alveolar epithelial injury**.  
4. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis typically presents with **chronic cough** and **dyspnea** in patients aged **50–70 years**.  
5. Risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include **smoking**, **genetic factors**, and **male sex**.  
6. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are often initially treated for **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** without improvement before diagnosis.  
7. Lung examination in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is notable for **bibasilar Velcro-like inspiratory crackles**.  
8. **Clubbing** is present in up to **50% of patients** with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
9. Chest radiographs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may demonstrate **bibasilar reticular changes**.  
10. **High-resolution CT (HRCT)** in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis shows **bilateral, subpleural, and basal-predominant reticular changes**.  
11. Advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may demonstrate **traction bronchiectasis** and **honeycombing** on HRCT.  
12. When HRCT findings are classic for **usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)**, **lung biopsy is not necessary** for diagnosis.  
13. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is progressive, with a **median survival of 3 to 5 years** after diagnosis.  
14. Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis present with **rapidly worsening symptoms** and **bilateral ground-glass opacities** superimposed on fibrosis.  
15. There are **no proven therapies** for acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
16. Management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis includes **antifibrotic therapies** and **oxygen supplementation** for hypoxemia.  
17. **Nintedanib** (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and **pirfenidone** (an antifibrotic agent) are approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
18. **Nintedanib** and **pirfenidone** both demonstrate a **decline in the rate of disease progression**, but they are **not curative**.  
19. Referral to a **pulmonologist** or an **interstitial lung disease (ILD) center** is appropriate before initiating antifibrotic therapy.  
20. Early referral to a **lung transplantation center** is strongly recommended in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, especially if the patient does not respond to medical therapy.  
21. **Palliative care consultation** to establish advanced care plans should be considered in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients who are not candidates for lung transplantation.  
22. Typical HRCT findings in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis include **peripheral and basilar-predominant reticular changes**, **honeycombing**, and **absence of significant ground-glass opacification**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The histopathologic pattern of UIP is the diagnostic hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
6. Misdiagnosis as COPD delays appropriate therapy since IPF often occurs in older smokers.  
14. Acute exacerbations may represent accelerated progression of underlying fibrosis.  
17. Despite different mechanisms, nintedanib and pirfenidone show similar clinical benefits.  
22. The absence of diffuse ground-glass opacities helps distinguish idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from other interstitial lung diseases.
