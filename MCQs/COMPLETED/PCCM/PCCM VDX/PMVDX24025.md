### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Radiation Pneumonitis on Chest CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Radiation pneumonitis** typically occurs **4 to 12 weeks** after initial **radiation exposure**.
2. On **high-resolution chest CT**, radiation pneumonitis demonstrates **ground-glass opacities** usually confined to the **field of radiation exposure**.
3. A **well-defined nonanatomic demarcation** between normal and abnormal lung consistent with the **radiation field** is pathognomonic for **radiation pneumonitis**, although it is not always present.
4. **Radiation pneumonitis** presents clinically with **cough**, **shortness of breath**, and a **new radiographic infiltrate**.
5. **Fever**, **pleuritic chest pain**, **fatigue**, and **weight loss** are additional nonspecific symptoms of **radiation pneumonitis**.
6. The differential diagnosis of **radiation pneumonitis** includes **infection** and **drug-induced lung injury**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. In this case, the chest CT scan shows a **nonanatomic straight-line demarcation** between involved and noninvolved lung parenchyma (red arrows), consistent with radiation pneumonitis.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Radiation pneumonitis** typically occurs **4 to 12 weeks** after **radiation exposure**.
2. Patients with **radiation pneumonitis** present with **cough**, **dyspnea**, and **radiographic infiltrates**.
3. **Fever**, **pleuritic chest pain**, **fatigue**, and **weight loss** are nonspecific symptoms of **radiation pneumonitis**.
4. The differential diagnosis of **radiation pneumonitis** includes **infection** and **drug-induced lung injury**.
5. A **well-defined nonanatomic demarcation** between normal and abnormal lung consistent with the **radiation field** is pathognomonic but not always present.
6. **Organizing pneumonia** may be observed **outside the radiation field** on imaging.
7. **Observation** may be appropriate for patients with **mild radiation pneumonitis**.
8. **Glucocorticoids** are used in patients with **severe symptoms** or **hypoxemia** due to **radiation pneumonitis**.
9. Between **6 to 12 months** after radiation exposure, **high-resolution CT** may show **septal thickening**, **traction bronchiectasis**, and **volume loss** consistent with **chronic fibrosis**.
10. Individuals exposed to radiation are at risk for **radiation recall pneumonitis**.
11. **Radiation recall pneumonitis** may occur when previously irradiated lung tissue is later exposed to **immune checkpoint inhibitors** or **chemotherapy agents** including **doxorubicin**, **etoposide**, **gemcitabine**, **paclitaxel**, and **pemetrexed**.

#### 💬 Extra
6. Organizing pneumonia outside the radiation field represents a distinct imaging finding compared with the typical in-field demarcation of radiation pneumonitis.  
9. These chronic changes indicate progression from acute pneumonitis to late-phase **radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis**.  
11. Radiation recall pneumonitis represents an **idiosyncratic inflammatory reaction** triggered by certain systemic therapies in previously irradiated lung tissue.
