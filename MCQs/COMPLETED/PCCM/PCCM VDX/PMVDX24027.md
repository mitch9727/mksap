### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Pulmonary Edema on Point-of-Care Ultrasonography

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pulmonary edema** on point-of-care ultrasonography is indicated by **B lines**, which are vertical hyperechoic lines extending downward from the pleural line, resembling lasers or searchlights.
2. A **diffuse B-line pattern** on lung ultrasound suggests **interstitial thickening**, most often caused by **fluid or pulmonary edema**.
3. **Lung sliding** is a normal finding on ultrasound and appears as a hyperechoic horizontal pleural line moving with respiration.
4. The combination of **lung sliding** and **B lines throughout** excludes the diagnosis of **pneumothorax**.
5. **Pleural effusion** on ultrasound typically appears as an **anechoic (black) region** in dependent areas cephalad to the diaphragm.

#### 💬 Extra
1. B lines are the sonographic equivalent of **Kerley B lines** seen on chest radiography.
3. Absence of lung sliding, in contrast, may suggest pneumothorax or pleural adhesion.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Point-of-care thoracic ultrasonography** is a noninvasive method for rapidly assessing the **lungs, pleura, and diaphragm**, and is especially helpful in critically ill patients due to its accessibility.
2. Thoracic ultrasonography shows **pleural effusions** (presence, characteristics, and volume) more accurately than **chest radiography**.
3. **Ultrasound guidance** for pleural drainage procedures such as **thoracentesis** or **thoracostomy tube placement** reduces the risk of complications, including **pneumothorax**.
4. Demonstration of **visceral pleura moving against parietal pleura** (lung sliding or lung pulse sign) excludes **pneumothorax** at the scanned site.
5. Thoracic ultrasonography assesses **diaphragm function** more accurately than **fluoroscopy**.
6. Ultrasonography of the **lung parenchyma** can identify **pulmonary edema** and areas of **lung consolidation**.
7. **Obesity**, **soft tissue edema**, and **increased musculature** can degrade lung ultrasound image quality.
8. **Complex or high-density pleural collections**, such as **empyema** or **hemothorax**, may be too echogenic for accurate detection or tissue identification.
9. **B lines** are vertical hyperechoic artifacts that arise from the pleural line, extend to the bottom of the screen, widen with depth, and move synchronously with lung sliding.
10. **Diffuse B lines** may be present in **pulmonary edema**, **interstitial lung disease**, and **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**.
11. In **severe pulmonary edema**, B lines may **coalesce**.
12. A **consolidated lung** on ultrasound appears similar to the **liver** in echotexture, termed **hepatization**.
13. **Dynamic air bronchograms**, which appear bright white and move within a viscous medium during respiration, suggest an **infectious cause** of lung consolidation.

#### 💬 Extra
4. The **lung sliding sign** reflects pleural movement with respiration, while the **lung pulse sign** reflects pleural movement synchronous with cardiac pulsations.
9. Coalescent B lines represent more severe interstitial-alveolar syndrome, often from marked pulmonary edema.
12. Hepatization of the lung describes parenchyma becoming tissue-dense and organ-like, a hallmark of consolidation.
13. Dynamic air bronchograms differentiate pneumonia from atelectasis, in which air bronchograms are static.
