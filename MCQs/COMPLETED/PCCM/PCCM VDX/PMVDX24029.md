### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Radiographic Findings Consistent with COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is a **clinical diagnosis** that requires appropriate history and pulmonary function test results to establish.
2. Chest radiographic findings consistent with **obstructive lung disease such as COPD** include **hyperinflation with increased lucency** throughout both lung fields.
3. **Decreased vascularity** on chest radiograph is consistent with **obstructive lung disease such as COPD**.
4. On lateral chest radiograph, **flattening of the diaphragm** is a finding consistent with **obstructive lung disease such as COPD**.
5. On lateral chest radiograph, an **increased retrosternal air space** is a finding consistent with **obstructive lung disease such as COPD**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. COPD cannot be diagnosed by radiograph alone; radiographic findings may be supportive but are not diagnostic.
2–5. These radiographic signs reflect the anatomic changes caused by air trapping and lung hyperinflation in obstructive disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is an **inflammatory condition**.
2. **Cigarette smoke** and other irritants activate both **macrophages** and **epithelial cells** within the respiratory tract.
3. Activated **epithelial cells** release several **neutrophil chemotactic factors** in COPD.
4. **Macrophages and recruited neutrophils** release **proteases** that cause **destruction of lung parenchyma** in COPD.
5. **Proteases** are normally inactivated by **antiproteases** such as **α1-antitrypsin**, but protease levels are increased in COPD.
6. **Oxidative stress** from irritants and inflammatory cells may lead to additional inflammation and tissue destruction in COPD.
7. **Fibrosis of the small airways** and **reduced elastic recoil of the lungs** lead to **static hyperinflation** in COPD.
8. **Mucin concentrations** are abnormally elevated in COPD.
9. Increased inflammation in COPD worsens **airflow obstruction** and decreases the ability to fully exhale.
10. In COPD, inhalation may be initiated before exhalation is completed, resulting in **dynamic hyperinflation (air trapping)**.
11. Radiographic signs of hyperinflation in COPD include **increased anteroposterior chest diameter** and **flattening of the diaphragm**.
12. **Diaphragmatic flattening** in COPD further limits the ability to increase breath volume during exertion.
13. Patients with COPD may use **accessory muscles** to increase tidal volume and may have an **increased respiratory rate** to augment minute ventilation.
14. These physiologic changes increase the **work of breathing** and contribute to the sensation of **dyspnea** in COPD.

#### 💬 Extra
5. **α1-Antitrypsin deficiency** represents a genetic risk factor for COPD due to impaired antiprotease activity.
10. Dynamic hyperinflation occurs when exhalation is incomplete before the next inhalation, causing progressive air trapping with exertion.
