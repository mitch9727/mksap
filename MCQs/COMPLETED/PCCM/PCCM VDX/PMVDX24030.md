### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Solitary Pulmonary Nodule on Chest CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **solitary pulmonary nodule** is defined as a **well-circumscribed lung lesion ≤30 mm** in size.
2. A **pulmonary mass** is defined as a **lung lesion >30 mm** in size.
3. Differentiating an enhancing pulmonary nodule from a vessel on CT may require **multiple contiguous images**.
4. **Pulmonary vessels** become progressively smaller in diameter with increasing distance from the hilum.
5. The absence of additional discrete nodular infiltrates on chest CT makes **aspergilloma** and **pneumonia** unlikely.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. On imaging, **pulmonary nodules** are defined as **small opacities <3 cm** surrounded by normal lung parenchyma, whereas a **focal opacity >3 cm** is considered a **lung mass** and presumed malignant until proved otherwise.
2. **Pulmonary nodules** are frequently detected **incidentally** because of the high use of **chest CT** for other indications.
3. **Lung masses (>3 cm)** should be presumed **malignant until proved otherwise**.
4. When multiple pulmonary nodules are present, **follow-up is determined by the largest lesion**.
5. A **well-demarcated, centrally or fully calcified nodule** usually represents a **previous infectious granuloma** and is considered **benign**.
6. Common infectious causes of **benign granulomatous nodules** include **endemic fungi** (e.g., histoplasmosis) and **mycobacteria** (e.g., tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria).
7. **Subsolid nodules**, including **pure ground-glass** and **part-solid nodules**, often represent **premalignant adenocarcinoma in situ** and may grow very slowly, with doubling times between **400–800 days**.
8. **Development or growth of a solid component** in a **subsolid nodule** suggests **malignancy**.
9. **Subsolid nodules** are not reliably characterized by **PET/CT**, and **nonsurgical biopsies** have limited sensitivity.
10. The **Brock model** and similar prediction calculators estimate malignancy risk based on factors such as **age, sex, smoking history, nodule size, lung location, and border morphology**.
11. **Solid nodules >8 mm** with moderate risk should be further characterized with **PET/CT**, with management based on results.
12. **Solid nodules >8 mm** with high risk should be staged with **PET/CT** followed by **definitive management** (e.g., resection, chemotherapy, radiation).

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Recommendations for Single Pulmonary Nodule Follow-Up)
1. For **incidentally detected pulmonary nodules <6 mm** in **low-risk patients**, **no follow-up** is required.
2. For **incidentally detected pulmonary nodules <6 mm** in **high-risk patients**, **optional chest CT at 12 months** may be performed.
3. For **6–8 mm pulmonary nodules** in **low-risk patients**, **chest CT at 6–12 months** is recommended, with optional **chest CT at 18–24 months**.
4. For **6–8 mm pulmonary nodules** in **high-risk patients**, **chest CT at 6–12 months** and **again at 18–24 months** is recommended.
5. For **pulmonary nodules >8 mm** in any patient, evaluation should include **chest CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling**.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Recommendations for Solitary Subsolid Lung Nodule Follow-Up)
1. **Pure ground-glass nodules <6 mm** require **no follow-up**.
2. **Pure ground-glass nodules ≥6 mm** require **CT at 6–12 months to confirm persistence**, followed by **CT every 2 years up to 5 years**.
3. **Part-solid nodules <6 mm** require **no follow-up**.
4. **Part-solid nodules ≥6 mm** require **CT at 3–6 months to confirm persistence**; if unchanged and the solid component remains **<6 mm**, **annual CT for 5 years** is recommended.

    <strong>Radiographic Evolution of Part-Solid Pulmonary Nodule.</strong>  
    Radiographs show a part-solid, part–ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe (A); growth in the solid component at 1 year (B); an increase in the ground-glass component at 4 years (C); and further growth of the solid component at 6 years (D). This slow growth pattern is characteristic of part-solid nodules progressing from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma.
