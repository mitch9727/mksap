### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Pneumothorax on Chest Radiography

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **pneumothorax** is identified on chest radiography by an **edge demarcating the abrupt end of parenchymal lung tissue**, with air lateral to this edge that appears darker than the adjacent lung.
2. A **pneumothorax** may occur following **subclavian catheter placement**.
3. On chest radiography, the **catheter tip** should ideally lie at the **junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The demarcation edge (white arrowheads) distinguishes collapsed lung from the air-filled pleural space.
2. Subclavian catheterization is a known iatrogenic cause of pneumothorax.
3. Catheter malposition outside the superior vena cava–right atrium junction can cause complications.

#### ✅ True Statements — Evaluation of Pneumothorax
1. **Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)** occurs **without underlying lung disease**, whereas **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP)** occurs **with underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
2. **Recurrence risk** after **primary spontaneous pneumothorax** is **23% to 50% over 1 to 5 years**.
3. **Recurrence risk** after **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax** is **greater than 50% over 1 to 3 years**.
4. Symptoms of **pneumothorax** include **sudden dyspnea** and **sharp pleuritic chest pain**, and symptoms are **typically more severe in secondary spontaneous pneumothorax**.
5. Physical examination in **pneumothorax** commonly shows **reduced lung expansion**, **hyperresonance to percussion**, and **diminished breath sounds** on the affected side.
6. **Tension pneumothorax** should be **suspected** when significant **cardiorespiratory distress** is present, including **worsening dyspnea**, **hypotension**, **absent breath sounds** on one side, **tracheal deviation**, and **distended neck veins**.
7. **Chest radiography** is an **appropriate initial test** for suspected pneumothorax because it can **confirm the diagnosis** and **determine pneumothorax size**.
8. On chest radiography, a **lung margin greater than 2 cm from the chest wall at the level of the hilum** defines a **large pneumothorax**.
9. **Computed tomography (CT)** is the **most sensitive** imaging modality for **small pneumothoraces**.
10. **Computed tomography (CT)** is **particularly useful** for evaluating pneumothorax in **bullous emphysema**.
11. **Thoracic ultrasonography** can aid diagnosis of pneumothorax; the **presence of lung sliding** at a scanned point indicates **no pneumothorax at that location**.
12. On thoracic ultrasonography, the **lung point** **confirms the edge** of a pneumothorax.
13. **Thoracic ultrasonography** is **indicated in unstable patients** with concern for **tension physiology**.
14. On thoracic ultrasonography, **lung sliding** represents **visceral pleura moving against parietal pleura with respiration**.
15. **Absent lung sliding** can occur **without pneumothorax** in the presence of **pulmonary blebs, inflammation, scarring, adhesions,** or **apnea**.
16. In **large pneumothorax**, a **lung point may not be identifiable** on ultrasonography.

#### 💬 Extra — Evaluation of Pneumothorax
8. The **>2 cm** threshold is measured **at the level of the hilum** on the chest radiograph.
11. **Lung sliding** excludes pneumothorax **only at the specific location scanned**.
12. Identification of a **lung point** is **specific** for pneumothorax and provides an estimate of **pneumothorax size**.
13. Point‑of‑care ultrasound is useful when immediate bedside assessment is needed for **hemodynamically unstable** patients.

  <video src="Lung Sliding Sign.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Lung Sliding Sign</strong>. Video ultrasound of the lung demonstrating the lung sliding sign, which excludes the diagnosis of pneumothorax at the point of scanning. Lung sliding represents visceral pleura moving against parietal pleura with respiration. If the sign is absent or nonspecific (in the absence of any lung disease), it indicates the presence of a pneumothorax. The lung sliding sign may also be absent in the presence of pulmonary blebs, inflammation, scarring, adhesions, and apnea.</figcaption>

  <video src="Lung Point Sign.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Lung Point Sign</strong>. Video ultrasound of the lung demonstrating the lung point sign. This sign can be used to identify a pneumothorax on ultrasonography. This is the point where the visceral pleura and parietal pleura (lung and chest wall) separate from each other because of the pneumothorax. In the absence of a pneumothorax, the two surfaces typically slide along each other (lung sliding sign). When air separates the two surfaces, lung sliding is absent (no sliding sign). The point between sliding and no sliding is the lung point; it is a specific sign for pneumothorax and suggests the size of the pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large, a lung point may not be found.</figcaption>
