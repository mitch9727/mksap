### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Variable Extrathoracic Upper Airway Obstruction

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **flow-volume curve** with an **inspiratory plateau** indicates **variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction**.  
2. **Extrathoracic obstruction** occurs **above the thoracic inlet**, the level at which respiration-related changes in pleural pressure are transmitted to the airway.  
3. In **variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction**, **flow is impaired during inspiration** because **negative intraluminal pressure** narrows the airway.  
4. In **variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction**, **flow is not impaired during expiration** because **positive intraluminal pressure** widens the airway.  
5. A **partially obstructing extrathoracic intraluminal tumor** that is not circumferential can cause **variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Flow-volume loops can differentiate extrathoracic from intrathoracic and fixed upper airway obstruction patterns.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Pulmonary function testing interpretation classifies abnormal results as **obstructive**, **restrictive**, or **mixed obstructive/restrictive** and assesses severity of impairment.  
2. A **reduced FEV1/FVC ratio** is consistent with **obstruction**.  
3. Severity of **obstruction** is determined according to the **measured FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value**.  
4. The **American Thoracic Society (ATS)** and **European Respiratory Society (ERS)** define a reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** as **below the lower limit of normal**.  
5. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)** defines a reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** as **below 0.70** on a **postbronchodilator test**.  
6. In 2021, the **ATS/ERS technical standard** changed bronchodilator responsiveness criteria to an **increase from baseline in FEV1, FVC, or both of at least 10% relative to the predicted value**.  
7. Many laboratories still use the **former bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds** of **12% and 200 mL** increase.  
8. Measurement of **lung volumes** may help assess **obstructive lung disease** but is not necessary for diagnosis.  
9. **Elevation of total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (≥120% of predicted)** indicates **hyperinflation and air trapping**, a common pattern in **severe COPD**.  
10. If **FEV1 or FVC is reduced** and the **FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.70**, then the pattern may be interpreted as **restrictive**.  
11. Measurement of **TLC <80% of predicted (or below lower limit of normal)** confirms the presence of **restrictive disease**.  
12. **Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema** can produce both a **low TLC (restrictive)** and **low FEV1/FVC ratio (obstructive)**.  
13. **Obesity** often results in **reduced FEV1 and FVC**, with a **preserved FEV1/FVC ratio** and modest reduction in **TLC and expiratory reserve volume**.  
14. The **diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco)** is reduced in conditions with **destruction, infiltration, removal, or dysfunction** of alveolar-capillary units, such as **COPD, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, lung resection, or pulmonary vascular disease**.  
15. The **Dlco** is elevated in conditions that **increase pulmonary capillary blood volume**, such as **pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, left-to-right shunt, or asthma**.  
16. The **flow-volume loop** is a **graphic representation** of **maximally forced inspiratory and expiratory flow (Y-axis)** against **volume (X-axis)**.  
17. The **shape of the spirometric flow-volume loop** can help differentiate **obstructive from restrictive patterns** and suggest the **anatomic location of airway obstruction**.  

#### 💬 Extra
6. The change from 12%/200 mL to 10% relative to predicted reflects evolving ATS/ERS criteria for bronchodilator response.  
9. Hyperinflation and air trapping are hallmark findings in advanced COPD physiology.  
13. Obesity-related reductions in lung volumes mimic restriction but typically preserve FEV1/FVC ratio.  
15. Increased Dlco in asthma reflects increased pulmonary blood volume rather than parenchymal damage.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Characterization of Impairment Severity in Pulmonary Function Tests)
1. An FEV1 of 70% to 79% of predicted indicates **mild impairment**.
2. An FEV1 of 60% to 69% of predicted indicates **moderate impairment**.
3. An FEV1 of 50% to 59% of predicted indicates **moderately severe impairment**.
4. An FEV1 of 35% to 49% of predicted indicates **severe impairment**.
5. An FEV1 less than 35% of predicted indicates **very severe impairment**.
6. A diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) below the lower limit of normal but greater than 60% indicates **mild impairment**.
7. A Dlco of 40% to 60% of predicted indicates **moderate impairment**.
8. A Dlco less than 40% of predicted indicates **severe impairment**.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
6. The lower limit of normal for Dlco corresponds to the fifth percentile of healthy never-smokers.
