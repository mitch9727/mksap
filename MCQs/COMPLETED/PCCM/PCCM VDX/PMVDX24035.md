### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Bronchiectasis on Chest CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchiectasis** is diagnosed on chest CT scan by findings of **airway dilatation with lack of tapering**.  
2. **Bronchiectasis** may demonstrate **bronchial wall thickening** on chest CT scan.  
3. **Cysts** can be seen as an additional finding in **bronchiectasis** on chest CT scan.  
4. The **signet ring sign** is a feature of **bronchiectasis**, in which the **diameter of the bronchus** in cross-section is **larger than that of the adjacent pulmonary artery**.  
5. The **signet ring sign** manifests on chest CT as a **round or oval opacity** representing the dilated bronchus and a **smaller adjacent opacity** representing the corresponding pulmonary artery.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchiectasis** is diagnosed by **high-resolution chest CT**.
2. Diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis include an **airway diameter greater than that of its accompanying vessel**.
3. Diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis include a **lack of distal airway tapering**.
4. On chest CT, **bronchial wall thickening or cysts** may be present in bronchiectasis.
5. **Every patient diagnosed with bronchiectasis** requires evaluation for a **treatable underlying cause**.
6. Evaluation of bronchiectasis may include testing for **chronic bacterial or mycobacterial infections** to identify causes of disease progression and guide antimicrobial therapy.
7. Patients with bronchiectasis should be evaluated for **connective tissue disease** and **immune dysfunction**, including **immunoglobulin deficiencies**.
8. In select patients, testing for **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, **ciliary dysfunction**, or **α1-antitrypsin deficiency** may be appropriate.
9. Despite extensive evaluation, **more than half of bronchiectasis cases remain idiopathic**.

#### 💬 Extra
2–3. The **signet ring sign** refers to the bronchus being larger than its accompanying vessel; distal tapering normally occurs in healthy airways but is absent in bronchiectasis.
6. Identifying pathogens in bronchiectasis helps guide **targeted antimicrobial therapy** during exacerbations.  
9. Even with comprehensive testing, idiopathic bronchiectasis is common.
