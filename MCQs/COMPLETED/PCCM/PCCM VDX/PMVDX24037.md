### 🫁 Pulmonology: Right Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)** on electrocardiogram (ECG) can present as a **tall R wave in lead V1**.
2. **Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)** on ECG may show **persistent precordial S waves**.
3. **Right atrial enlargement** is an ECG feature that may accompany **right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)**.
4. **Right axis deviation** or an **indeterminate axis** can be seen in **right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)** on ECG.
5. An **rSr′ pattern in lead V1** is an ECG feature of **right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)**.
6. A **right ventricular strain pattern**, defined by **ST-T wave changes in the inferior leads**, may occur in **right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)**.
7. Specific findings supporting **right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)** on ECG include **rSr′ in V1**, **persistent S waves in V5 through V6**, a **right ventricular strain pattern**, and **probable right atrial abnormality**.
8. Causes of **right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)** include **pulmonary hypertension**, **mitral stenosis**, **chronic lung disease leading to cor pulmonale**, and **congenital heart disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A **tall R wave in V1** reflects right ventricular dominance over the left ventricle in anterior chest leads.
6. **Right ventricular strain patterns** represent repolarization abnormalities due to chronic pressure overload.
8. **Chronic lung disease** leading to **cor pulmonale** is a common acquired cause of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH).

#### ✅ True Statements — Evaluation of Suspected PH
1. **Pulmonary vascular remodeling** is the key pathophysiologic process in **pulmonary hypertension (PH)**.
2. As **pulmonary vascular remodeling** progresses in PH, **pulmonary artery pressures** rise.
3. **Right ventricular (RV) remodeling and compensation** initially maintain normal cardiac output in PH, but progressive disease leads to RV failure.
4. Symptoms of **pulmonary hypertension** include **exertional dyspnea**, **lower extremity edema**, **chest pain**, **palpitations**, and sometimes **syncope**.
5. The average time from **symptom onset to diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension** exceeds **2 years**.
6. Physical examination findings in **pulmonary hypertension** include **accentuated or persistently split S2** and a **tricuspid regurgitant murmur**.
7. Additional physical examination findings in advanced **pulmonary hypertension with RV failure** include **jugular venous distention**, **RV heave**, **hepatomegaly**, **ascites**, and **peripheral edema**.
8. If **pulmonary hypertension** is suspected, **transthoracic echocardiography** should be performed.
9. Echocardiographic features of **pulmonary hypertension** include **elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity**, **right atrial enlargement**, **right ventricular enlargement**, **septal flattening**, and **decreased right ventricular function**.
10. **Echocardiography** provides only **estimated pulmonary artery pressure measurements** and should **not be used to confirm** the diagnosis of **pulmonary hypertension**.
11. **Pulmonary artery catheterization** is essential to confirm a diagnosis of **pulmonary hypertension** because it provides **accurate hemodynamic data** and helps distinguish the primary cause of elevated pulmonary artery pressure.
12. Evaluation of suspected **pulmonary hypertension** should assess for contribution from **left-sided heart disease**, **lung disease**, or **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** because these causes affect prognosis and treatment.
13. In addition to echocardiography, diagnostic tests for suspected **pulmonary hypertension** may include **pulmonary function tests**, **high-resolution chest CT**, and **ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning**.
14. The **6-minute walk test** provides **prognostic information** and a baseline for assessment of **therapeutic response** in **pulmonary hypertension**.
15. Some patients with **pulmonary arterial hypertension** may also have **concomitant left-sided heart disease**, and evaluation often requires testing for multiple underlying causes of PH.

#### 💬 Extra
4. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are nonspecific, which contributes to the delay in diagnosis.
8. Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended as the first-line imaging test when pulmonary hypertension is suspected.
11. Pulmonary artery catheterization is especially valuable in patients without an obvious cause of pulmonary hypertension, such as severe left-sided cardiac disease.
