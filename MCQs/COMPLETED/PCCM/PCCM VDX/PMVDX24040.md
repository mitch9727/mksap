### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Bronchiectasis on Chest CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchiectasis** is defined as **irreversible dilatation of the bronchi**.
2. On chest CT, **bronchiectasis** is identified by **multiple dilated and thick-walled bronchi**.
3. The **signet ring sign** of bronchiectasis is present when the **diameter of a bronchus in cross-section is larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery**.
4. The **signet ring sign** appears as a **round or oval opacity** (dilated bronchus) adjacent to a **smaller opacity** (pulmonary artery).
5. In bronchiectasis, bronchi may show a **lack of normal tapering** in diameter when seen in **longitudinal section**.
6. **Mucus-filled bronchi** are a common finding in bronchiectasis.
7. Bronchiectasis may result from **airway damage due to chronic infection**.
8. **Difficulty in clearing mucus** from dilated bronchi contributes to **chronic colonization and infection**, perpetuating bronchiectasis.

#### 💬 Extra
3. The **signet ring sign** is a classic radiographic feature that helps distinguish bronchiectasis from normal bronchi.  
7–8. Chronic infection both causes and results from bronchiectasis, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of airway injury and colonization.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bronchiectasis** is diagnosed by **high-resolution chest CT**.
2. Diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis include an **airway diameter greater than that of its accompanying vessel**.
3. Diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis include a **lack of distal airway tapering**.
4. On chest CT, **bronchial wall thickening or cysts** may be present in bronchiectasis.
5. **Every patient diagnosed with bronchiectasis** requires evaluation for a **treatable underlying cause**.
6. Evaluation of bronchiectasis may include testing for **chronic bacterial or mycobacterial infections** to identify causes of disease progression and guide antimicrobial therapy.
7. Patients with bronchiectasis should be evaluated for **connective tissue disease** and **immune dysfunction**, including **immunoglobulin deficiencies**.
8. In select patients, testing for **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, **ciliary dysfunction**, or **α1-antitrypsin deficiency** may be appropriate.
9. Despite extensive evaluation, **more than half of bronchiectasis cases remain idiopathic**.

#### 💬 Extra
2–3. The **signet ring sign** refers to the bronchus being larger than its accompanying vessel; distal tapering normally occurs in healthy airways but is absent in bronchiectasis.  
6. Identifying pathogens in bronchiectasis helps guide **targeted antimicrobial therapy** during exacerbations.  
9. Even with comprehensive testing, idiopathic bronchiectasis is common.
