### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Prominence of the Pulmonary Arteries on Chest Radiograph

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Marked prominence of the **right and left pulmonary arteries** on chest radiograph is consistent with **pulmonary artery enlargement**.  
2. **Pulmonary artery enlargement** on chest radiograph may be seen with **pulmonary hypertension** of various causes.  
3. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** with **hyperinflation** can be a cause of **pulmonary hypertension**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Pulmonary artery prominence is identified by enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries relative to normal mediastinal structures.  
3. COPD causes chronic hypoxic vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, contributing to pulmonary hypertension.

#### ✅ True Statements — Evaluation of Suspected PH
1. **Pulmonary vascular remodeling** is the key pathophysiologic process in **pulmonary hypertension (PH)**.
2. As **pulmonary vascular remodeling** progresses in PH, **pulmonary artery pressures** rise.
3. **Right ventricular (RV) remodeling and compensation** initially maintain normal cardiac output in PH, but progressive disease leads to RV failure.
4. Symptoms of **pulmonary hypertension** include **exertional dyspnea**, **lower extremity edema**, **chest pain**, **palpitations**, and sometimes **syncope**.
5. The average time from **symptom onset to diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension** exceeds **2 years**.
6. Physical examination findings in **pulmonary hypertension** include **accentuated or persistently split S2** and a **tricuspid regurgitant murmur**.
7. Additional physical examination findings in advanced **pulmonary hypertension with RV failure** include **jugular venous distention**, **RV heave**, **hepatomegaly**, **ascites**, and **peripheral edema**.
8. If **pulmonary hypertension** is suspected, **transthoracic echocardiography** should be performed.
9. Echocardiographic features of **pulmonary hypertension** include **elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity**, **right atrial enlargement**, **right ventricular enlargement**, **septal flattening**, and **decreased right ventricular function**.
10. **Echocardiography** provides only **estimated pulmonary artery pressure measurements** and should **not be used to confirm** the diagnosis of **pulmonary hypertension**.
11. **Pulmonary artery catheterization** is essential to confirm a diagnosis of **pulmonary hypertension** because it provides **accurate hemodynamic data** and helps distinguish the primary cause of elevated pulmonary artery pressure.
12. Evaluation of suspected **pulmonary hypertension** should assess for contribution from **left-sided heart disease**, **lung disease**, or **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** because these causes affect prognosis and treatment.
13. In addition to echocardiography, diagnostic tests for suspected **pulmonary hypertension** may include **pulmonary function tests**, **high-resolution chest CT**, and **ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning**.
14. The **6-minute walk test** provides **prognostic information** and a baseline for assessment of **therapeutic response** in **pulmonary hypertension**.
15. Some patients with **pulmonary arterial hypertension** may also have **concomitant left-sided heart disease**, and evaluation often requires testing for multiple underlying causes of PH.

#### 💬 Extra
4. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are nonspecific, which contributes to the delay in diagnosis.
8. Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended as the first-line imaging test when pulmonary hypertension is suspected.
11. Pulmonary artery catheterization is especially valuable in patients without an obvious cause of pulmonary hypertension, such as severe left-sided cardiac disease.

#### ✅ True Statements — Diagnostic Algorithm for Suspected Pulmonary Hypertension
1. The **European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) algorithm** for suspected **pulmonary hypertension** includes **echocardiography** as an initial test.
2. In the **ESC/ERS algorithm**, **pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC)** is required to confirm **pulmonary hypertension**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Echocardiogram in Idiopathic PAH Versus in a Healthy Person
1. In **idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)**, echocardiography commonly shows **dilation of the right ventricle (RV) and right atrium (RA)**.
