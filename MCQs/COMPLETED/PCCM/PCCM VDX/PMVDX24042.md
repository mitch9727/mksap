### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema (CPFE)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE)** is best diagnosed with **high-resolution CT (HRCT)** imaging.  
2. **Upper lobe emphysema** is a hallmark feature of **CPFE** on HRCT.  
3. **Lower lobe pulmonary fibrosis** is a hallmark feature of **CPFE** on HRCT.  
4. **Pulmonary fibrosis** in CPFE is characterized by **bilateral, peripheral, subpleural, and basal-predominant septal line thickening (reticulations)** with **honeycomb changes**.  
5. **Bilateral pneumonia** typically shows **consolidative opacities** and not a **subpleural pattern**.  
6. **Bronchiectasis** is characterized by **dilated, thick-walled bronchi**, often with a **signet ring sign** (bronchus diameter greater than adjacent pulmonary artery), **lack of tapering**, and **mucus-filled bronchi**.  
7. **Pulmonary edema** is usually **diffuse and homogeneous**, affecting both **upper and lower lobes**, rather than showing a **subpleural or basal-predominant pattern**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. HRCT is the preferred diagnostic modality because it can show both emphysematous and fibrotic changes simultaneously.  
4. Honeycombing and reticulations are characteristic of pulmonary fibrosis, helping distinguish it from other lung diseases.  
5. Pneumonia shows consolidations rather than the subpleural reticular pattern of fibrosis.  
6. The signet ring sign is a key CT finding in bronchiectasis.  
7. Pulmonary edema typically has a diffuse homogeneous pattern, unlike the subpleural, basal-predominant fibrosis of CPFE.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE)** is a distinct clinical entity in which **fibrotic lung disease** similar to **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** coexists with **emphysema** in the same patient.  
2. In **CPFE**, the competing effects of **fibrosis** and **emphysema** often produce **mixed findings** on **pulmonary function testing**.  
3. **Higher lung volumes** than those seen in patients with pulmonary fibrosis alone may occur in **CPFE**.  
4. A **preserved FEV1/FVC ratio** may be present in **CPFE**, even in the setting of emphysema.  
5. **Reduced diffusing capacity (DLCO)** is a typical finding in **CPFE**.  
6. The development of **pulmonary hypertension** in **CPFE** indicates a **poor prognosis**.  
7. **Lung transplantation** is the only **curative therapy** for **CPFE**.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. Mixed pulmonary function findings result from the balancing effects of emphysema (increasing lung volumes) and fibrosis (reducing lung volumes).  
3. Higher lung volumes in CPFE contrast with the restrictive pattern seen in isolated pulmonary fibrosis.  
4. A preserved FEV1/FVC ratio is notable because emphysema alone would usually lower this ratio.  
5. Reduced DLCO reflects the marked impairment in gas exchange that is typical for CPFE.  
6. Pulmonary hypertension is a poor prognostic factor in CPFE.  
7. No medical therapy reverses CPFE; lung transplantation is the only curative treatment.
