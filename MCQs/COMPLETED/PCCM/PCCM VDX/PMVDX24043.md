### 🫁 Pulmonology: Radiation Pneumonitis Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Radiation pneumonitis** is characterized by **lung opacities on chest computed tomography (CT)** that are delineated by **straight lines corresponding to the radiation field**.
2. **Radiation pneumonitis opacities** can cross **multiple lobes**, such as the **right middle and right lower lobes**.
3. The **acute exudative phase of radiation pneumonitis** occurs **3 to 12 weeks following radiation exposure**.
4. The **fibrotic phase of radiation pneumonitis** usually develops **6 months to years after radiation exposure**.
5. **Atelectasis** does not cross multiple lobes and is typically **lobar, segmental, or subsegmental**.
6. **Lobar pneumonia** usually affects **one lobe**, whereas **multilobar pneumonia** involves **multiple lobes**.
7. **Pulmonary edema** is usually **bilateral** and is **not delineated by nonanatomic straight lines of involvement**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The straight-line borders of radiation pneumonitis reflect the geometry of the radiation field rather than anatomic divisions.
2. On CT, fissures can help identify lobe involvement, as seen with opacities crossing the major fissure between the right middle and lower lobes.
3. The acute phase reflects inflammatory exudation.
4. The fibrotic phase represents chronic scarring after radiation injury.

#### ✅ True Statements — Radiation Pneumonitis
1. **Radiation pneumonitis** typically occurs **4 to 12 weeks after radiation exposure**.
2. Clinical features of **radiation pneumonitis** include **cough, dyspnea, and radiographic infiltrates**.
3. Additional nonspecific symptoms of **radiation pneumonitis** include **fever, pleuritic chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss**.
4. The **differential diagnosis** of **radiation pneumonitis** often includes **infection** and **drug-induced lung injury**.
5. On imaging, a **well-defined nonanatomic demarcation** between normal and abnormal lung consistent with the **radiation field** is **pathognomonic** but **not always present**.
6. In **radiation pneumonitis**, **organizing pneumonia** may be observed **outside the field of radiation exposure**.
7. **Observation** may be appropriate for patients with **mild radiation pneumonitis**.
8. **Glucocorticoids** are used in **radiation pneumonitis** for patients with **severe symptoms or hypoxemia**.
9. From **6 to 12 months after radiation exposure**, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in **radiation pneumonitis** may show **septal thickening, traction bronchiectasis, and volume loss consistent with chronic fibrosis**.
10. Individuals exposed to radiation are at risk for **radiation recall pneumonitis**.
11. **Radiation recall pneumonitis** can be triggered when lung tissue is exposed to **immune checkpoint inhibitors** or **chemotherapy agents** including **doxorubicin, etoposide, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and pemetrexed**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The onset window overlaps with the acute exudative phase described in the main section.
4. Drug-induced lung injury is an important mimicker when evaluating new infiltrates after radiation.
5. The straight border reflects radiation field geometry rather than normal anatomy.
9. Chronic fibrosis findings represent progression beyond the acute inflammatory phase.
11. Radiation recall pneumonitis occurs in lung regions previously exposed to radiation, triggered by certain systemic therapies.
