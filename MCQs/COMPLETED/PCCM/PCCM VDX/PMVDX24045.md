### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Pleural Effusion Diagnosis on Chest Radiograph

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pleural effusion** on a frontal **chest radiograph** often shows a **meniscus sign** with gentle medial upsloping and a **concave line** that **obscures the costophrenic angle** and **part or all of the hemidiaphragm**.
2. A **large left‑sided pleural effusion** can cause **rightward displacement of mediastinal structures**.
3. **Diaphragmatic eventration** or **diaphragmatic paralysis** appears as a **smooth, dome‑shaped elevated hemidiaphragm** with **intact diaphragmatic continuity**, not a meniscus line.
4. **Atelectasis** represents **loss of gas within the lung** that **reduces volume** and causes **mediastinal and tracheal shift toward the affected side**.
5. **Lobar pneumonia** on **chest radiograph** is characterized by the presence of **air bronchograms** and **does not produce meniscus lines**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. On the referenced radiograph, **diffuse, dense opacification of the left lower hemithorax** accompanies the meniscus configuration.
2. On the referenced radiograph, the **trachea is slightly deviated to the right**.
4. For **left‑lung atelectasis**, the **mediastinum and trachea** would **shift leftward**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Diagnostic Imaging in the Evaluation of Pleural Effusion
1. **Chest radiography** should be the **first test** performed to evaluate a possible **pleural effusion**.
2. As little as **200 mL of pleural fluid** can be detected on a **posterior–anterior chest radiograph**, and **50 mL** can be detected on a **lateral chest radiograph**.
3. **Thoracic point-of-care ultrasonography** is useful for identifying **small pleural effusions**, especially in **semirecumbent or supine patients**, such as those who are **critically ill**.
4. **Thoracic ultrasonography** allows estimation of **pleural fluid volume** and determination of whether the effusion is **free-flowing or loculated**.
5. **Ultrasound guidance** for pleural procedures such as **thoracentesis** decreases the **rate of complications**.
6. **Chest CT with contrast** can detect **small pleural effusions**.
7. **Chest CT with contrast** can assess **coexisting intrathoracic abnormalities**, including **pulmonary and pleural masses**.
8. On CT imaging, **empyema** is suggested by **enhancement of the pleura around pleural fluid** producing a **lenticular-shaped opacity**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Chest Radiographs Showing Various Pleural Effusions
1. On chest radiograph, a **moderate pleural effusion** may appear as **layering fluid over the lower hemithorax**.
2. A **large pleural effusion** can produce the **meniscus sign**, seen as a **rim of fluid ascending the lateral chest wall**.
3. A **loculated pleural effusion** may present as a **lateral chest wall opacity** with **septations** and **separate compartments**.
4. **Bilateral multiloculated pleural effusions** can occur, with **multiple compartmentalized fluid collections** visible on chest radiographs.

#### ✅ True Statements — Ultrasound Showing Moderate Right-Sided Pleural Effusion
1. On thoracic ultrasound, a **pleural effusion** appears as an **anechoic or hypoechoic space** between the **lung and diaphragm**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Simple and Complicated Pleural Effusions on Ultrasound
1. A **simple pleural effusion** on ultrasound appears as a **hypoechoic collection**, which may be either **transudative or exudative**.
2. A **complicated pleural effusion** on ultrasound appears as a **multiseptated (loculated) fluid collection**, which is always **exudative**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Fluid Pocket and Pleural Thickening on CT Scan in Empyema
1. On CT imaging, an **empyema** may show a **pleural fluid pocket** with **enhancing pleura** producing a **lenticular-shaped opacity**.
2. **Pleural thickening** may also be present on CT imaging in **empyema**.

#### 💬 Extra
2 (Radiographs). The **meniscus sign** is a classic radiographic feature of large effusions.  
3 (Radiographs). Loculation occurs when pleural inflammation leads to fibrin deposition and septation formation.  
1 (Ultrasound). Thoracic ultrasound is highly sensitive for detecting even small effusions.  
2 (Simple vs Complicated US). Multiseptated appearance corresponds to fibrin deposition within the pleural space.  
2 (CT Empyema). Pleural thickening helps differentiate empyema from simple effusion.
