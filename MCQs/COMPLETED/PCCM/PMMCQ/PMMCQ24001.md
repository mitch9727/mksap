### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)** is characterized by **daytime hypercapnia**, defined as an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (**Pco₂**) greater than 45 mm Hg (6.0 kPa).  
2. **OHS** results from **limitations in ventilatory drive** and **capacity related to significant obesity**.  
3. Persons with a **body mass index (BMI) ≥30** are considered **at risk** for **OHS**.  
4. More than **50% of patients with BMI ≥50** have **OHS**.  
5. **Many patients with OHS** present when **chronic hypercapnia and hypoxia** lead to **polycythemia**, **right heart failure**, and **pulmonary hypertension**.  
6. A **serum bicarbonate level >27 mEq/L (27 mmol/L)** is a **clue to the diagnosis** of **OHS**.  
7. **Gas exchange impairment** beyond the typical repetitive desaturations of **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** is often seen on **sleep testing** in **OHS**.  
8. The diagnosis of **OHS** requires **exclusion of other causes of chronic hypoventilation**, such as **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Central sleep apnea is characterized by **hyperventilation tendency** and **normocapnia or hypocapnia**, not chronic hypercapnia.  
2. Pulmonary function testing showing a **normal FEV1/FVC ratio** helps exclude **COPD** in suspected **OHS**.  
3. **OSA** is frequently present in **OHS**, but severe OSA is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index ≥30, which may not always be present.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **OHS** results from the **mechanical load on the respiratory pump** and **blunting of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide**.  
2. Persons with a **BMI ≥30** are considered **at risk for OHS**, and more than **half of patients with BMI ≥50** have **OHS**.  
3. The **hallmark of OHS** is **daytime hypercapnia** (**Pco₂ >45 mm Hg [6.0 kPa]**).  
4. A **serum bicarbonate level >27 mEq/L (27 mmol/L)** is a **diagnostic clue** for **OHS**.  
5. **OHS** can lead to **polycythemia**, **right-sided heart failure**, and **pulmonary hypertension** due to chronic hypoxemia.  
6. **Other causes of hypercapnia and hypoventilation**, such as **COPD** and **OSA**, must be **excluded before diagnosing OHS**.  
7. **OSA** is usually but not always superimposed on **OHS**, and **polysomnography** should be performed in all patients with suspected OHS.  
8. **Gas exchange impairment beyond repetitive desaturations** of OSA is often found in **OHS** during sleep testing.  
9. **Weight loss** is essential in **OHS management**, and **bariatric surgery** may be considered.  
10. **Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy** is indicated in **OHS**, with **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** recommended for **stable ambulatory patients**, regardless of whether severe OSA is present.  
11. For **hospitalized patients with OHS-related respiratory failure**, the **American Thoracic Society** recommends **bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** (with or without a backup rate) or **volume-targeted pressure support**, continued after discharge until polysomnography and titration.  
12. **Supplemental oxygen** may be necessary in **OHS**, but should **not be administered as the only treatment**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The **mechanical load** from obesity increases work of breathing, while **blunted chemoreceptor response** reduces ventilatory drive.  
7. **OSA** complicates both diagnosis and management of **OHS**, making polysomnography critical.  
10. **CPAP** can be used even in the absence of severe **OSA** in stable **OHS** patients.  
11. **BPAP** or **volume-targeted support** provides ventilatory assistance during acute decompensation and bridges to outpatient titration.
