### 🫁 Sleep Medicine: Mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Obesity** is the most important risk factor for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**.  
2. **Weight loss** decreases severity of **OSA**, **snoring**, and **apnea** in patients who are overweight or obese.  
3. **Weight loss** should be recommended to **all patients with OSA** who are overweight or obese.  
4. In **minimally symptomatic patients with mild OSA**, **weight loss alone** may be the preferred therapy.  
5. **Conservative measures** such as limiting **supine sleeping position** and reducing **alcohol intake** may improve **OSA**.  
6. **Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT)** should be reserved for patients with a **high probability of moderate to severe OSA** in whom **positive airway pressure therapy** is being considered.  
7. **HSAT** is less sensitive in patients with **milder OSA**.  
8. **In-laboratory polysomnography** is indicated for **symptomatic patients** seeking targeted OSA treatment or those with a **high likelihood of mild OSA** who have **not improved with conservative therapy**.  
9. **Overnight pulse oximetry** is **poorly discriminative** when used alone and has **no proven role** in diagnosing possible **OSA**.

#### 💬 Extra
2–4. Weight loss is considered **first-line therapy** in overweight or obese patients with mild, minimally symptomatic OSA.  
5. Supine positioning and alcohol use can worsen OSA by increasing airway collapse.  
8. Polysomnography directly measures **sleep architecture** and is the gold standard for diagnosis.  
9. Although pulse oximetry is part of HSAT and polysomnography, it cannot distinguish OSA severity by itself.

#### ✅ True Statements — Clinical Features and Diagnosis of OSA
1. **Sleep-related choking or gasping**, especially when noticed by a bed partner, is a **sensitive pretest indicator** of **OSA**.  
2. **Loud snoring**, **daytime sleepiness**, and **hypertension**, in combination with sleep-related choking or gasping, are suggestive of at least **moderate OSA**.  
3. Additional symptoms of **OSA** may include **overnight awakenings**, **nocturia**, and **unrefreshing sleep**.  
4. **Morning headaches** can occur in **OSA** but are not common.  
5. **OSA** may be recognized postoperatively after **general anesthesia or opioid use**, presenting as **repeated hypoxemia** or **respiratory failure**.  
6. The most important established consequence of **OSA** is **excessive daytime sleepiness**.  
7. **Collateral history** and questionnaires such as the **Epworth Sleepiness Scale** help identify **excessive daytime sleepiness**.  
8. **Neuropsychiatric symptoms** of **OSA** may include **mood alterations**, **difficulty concentrating**, and **impaired task performance**.  
9. **Objective testing** is required for the **diagnosis of OSA**.  
10. **Physical examination findings** (e.g., crowded oropharynx, increased neck circumference) and **questionnaires** may increase pretest probability but are **not sufficient** to diagnose OSA.  
11. **Overnight pulse oximetry alone** is **poorly discriminative** and has **no proven role** in the diagnosis of OSA.  
12. **HSAT** does not measure **electroencephalographic sleep** but instead uses **respiratory instruments**, **vascular tone monitoring**, **pulse oximetry**, and an **accelerometer for posture detection**.  
13. **HSAT** is highly sensitive for diagnosing **OSA** in patients with a **moderate to severe pretest likelihood** suggested by **daytime sleepiness** plus at least two of: **sleep-related choking or gasping**, **loud snoring**, or **hypertension**.  
14. **HSAT** is less sensitive in patients with **mild OSA**.  
15. **Polysomnography** is the **preferred diagnostic test** for **mild OSA** and for patients with **complex comorbid conditions** such as **heart failure**, **neuromuscular disease**, or **advanced pulmonary disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1–2. Bed partner observations provide strong clinical suspicion for OSA.  
6–8. Excessive daytime sleepiness is both the hallmark symptom and a key morbidity of OSA.  
12–13. HSAT is best suited for patients with a **high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA**.  
15. Polysomnography remains the **gold standard**, especially in mild or comorbid disease settings.
