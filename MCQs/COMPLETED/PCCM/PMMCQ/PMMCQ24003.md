### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Evaluation of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness with Actigraphy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Excessive daytime sleepiness** refers to difficulty staying awake and alert during daytime hours.
2. **Insufficient sleep syndrome**, or functional impairment resulting from inadequate sleep, is the most common cause of **excessive daytime sleepiness**.
3. The **initial evaluation** of **excessive daytime sleepiness** should include a thorough history to assess sleep duration and time available for sleeping.
4. **Actigraphy** provides an objective assessment of sleep and wakefulness by measuring movement and ambient light during a 1- to 2-week timeframe.
5. **Sleep diaries** may be useful when actigraphy is not available.
6. **Consumer wearable devices** perform reasonably well in detecting sleep-wake patterns and may provide useful information.
7. **Home sleep apnea testing** is indicated only in patients with a high probability of moderate to severe **obstructive sleep apnea**, not in young patients of normal weight without upper airway abnormalities.
8. **Modafinil** is used to treat **shift work sleep disorder**, **narcolepsy**, and **idiopathic hypersomnia**, but is inappropriate before excluding **insufficient sleep syndrome**.
9. **Multiple sleep latency testing** is resource intensive and should be performed only after ruling out **insufficient sleep syndrome** and common sleep disorders, such as **obstructive sleep apnea**.
10. **Polysomnography** is indicated when clinical history suggests a **primary sleep disorder** and is key in the evaluation of **hypersomnia** if actigraphy shows adequate sleep.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Insufficient sleep syndrome is associated with **cardiovascular disease** and **metabolic disorders** such as **glucose intolerance** and **obesity**.
4. Actigraphy is wrist-worn and provides objective measurement across natural sleep-wake cycles.
8. Wake-promoting therapy should never precede exclusion of insufficient sleep and common sleep disorders.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Excessive daytime sleepiness** differs from **fatigue**, which is a lack of energy or sense of exhaustion limiting activity.
2. **Excessive daytime sleepiness** can result from **extrinsic (circumstantial)** or **intrinsic (disease-related)** causes.
3. Adults generally require **7 to 8 hours of sleep** per night, and deprivation of this amount can cause **sleepiness**.
4. **Insufficient sleep syndrome** is the most common cause of **excessive daytime sleepiness** and is associated with **cardiovascular disease**, **glucose intolerance**, and **obesity**.
5. Physicians should evaluate **sleep hygiene**, **bedtime habits**, **napping**, **caffeine use**, **impact on activities**, and **duration of symptoms** when assessing **excessive daytime sleepiness**.
6. A **1- or 2-week sleep diary** can help patients recognize suboptimal sleep habits.
7. **Questionnaires** such as the **Epworth Sleepiness Scale** quantify sleepiness and help gauge treatment response.
8. **Multiple sleep latency testing** provides an objective measure of sleepiness and is essential for diagnosing **narcolepsy** and **idiopathic hypersomnia**.
9. All patients with **excessive daytime sleepiness** should be counseled about the dangers of **drowsy driving**.
10. Short-term management of acute sleepiness may include **strategically timed naps** or **caffeine**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Fatigue is more likely attributable to other medical conditions rather than primary sleep disorders.
8. Multiple sleep latency testing is performed after a normal night of sleep in a laboratory with a series of daytime nap opportunities.
9. Driving while drowsy poses significant safety risks comparable to impaired driving.
