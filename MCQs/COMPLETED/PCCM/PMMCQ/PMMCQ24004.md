### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Moderate to Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT)** is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** in patients with a high probability of at least moderate disease who do not have significant **cardiopulmonary** or **neuromuscular disease**.
2. **HSAT** is less sensitive in suspected mild OSA, for which **in-laboratory polysomnography** is the preferred test.
3. **Polysomnography** is preferred over HSAT in patients with comorbid conditions such as **heart failure**, **neuromuscular disease**, or **advanced pulmonary disease**.
4. Clinical features suggesting at least moderate OSA include **sleep-related choking or gasping**, **loud snoring**, **daytime sleepiness**, and **hypertension**.
5. Both **HSAT** and **polysomnography** provide the **apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)**, the best composite metric of OSA disease severity.
6. An **AHI of 5–14 events per hour** indicates **mild OSA**, **15–30 events per hour** indicates **moderate OSA**, and **more than 30 events per hour** indicates **severe OSA**.
7. **Mandibular advancement devices** do not reduce the AHI as reliably as positive airway pressure and are most appropriate for **mild to moderate OSA**.
8. **Upper airway surgery**, including **tonsillectomy**, is variably effective and not considered **first-line therapy** for OSA in adults.

#### 💬 Extra
1. HSAT is particularly suitable when there is **high pretest probability** of moderate–severe OSA (for example, **witnessed nocturnal gasping**, **enlarged neck circumference**, and a **crowded oropharynx**).
7. **Mandibular advancement device** referral is **premature** before confirming an OSA diagnosis.
8. **Tonsillectomy** may reduce obstruction from enlarged tonsils but is **rarely effective as standalone therapy** for adult OSA.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Patient education** is recommended for all patients newly diagnosed with **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**.
2. **Weight loss** should be recommended to all patients with **OSA** who are **overweight** or **obese**.
3. In **minimally symptomatic mild OSA**, **weight loss** may be the **preferred therapy**.
4. Additional measures for mild OSA include **reducing alcohol intake before bedtime**, **avoiding sedating medications**, and **avoiding a supine posture** if OSA is position dependent.
5. **Bariatric surgery referral** should be considered for **BMI ≥35** when **positive airway pressure (PAP)** therapy is **not beneficial** or **not tolerated**.
6. Trials of **obesity medications** (including **glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists**) show **benefit in OSA** and its sequelae.
7. **Tirzepatide** is **FDA-approved** for **OSA treatment** and is also indicated for **type 2 diabetes mellitus** and **weight loss**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. Bariatric referral applies **after failure or intolerance of PAP** in patients with **BMI ≥35**.  
6. Pharmacologic weight-loss options are **emerging adjuncts** to lifestyle measures for OSA.  
7. **Tirzepatide** is the **first FDA-approved obesity medication for OSA**.
