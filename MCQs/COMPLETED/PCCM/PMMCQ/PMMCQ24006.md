### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Chronic Hypoventilation in Neuromuscular Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** or **volume-assured devices**, with or without **supplemental oxygen**, are indicated in patients with **neuromuscular disorders** who have **daytime hypercapnia** (arterial Pco₂ >45 mm Hg [6.0 kPa]) suggesting **chronic respiratory failure**.  
2. **Hypoventilation** in the setting of **neuromuscular disease** is most marked during **sleep**, particularly during **rapid eye movement (REM) sleep**, and may be exacerbated by **acute illness** or **anesthesia**.  
3. **Polysomnography** may aid in optimizing **ventilator and oxygen settings** and in assessing concomitant **sleep disorders**, but it is often unnecessary for diagnosis.  
4. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** is used to maintain **upper airway patency** in **obstructive sleep apnea** but does not augment ventilation and is **not appropriate** therapy for **chronic hypoventilation** due to **neuromuscular disease**.  
5. **Supplemental oxygen** alone does not correct **chronic hypercapnia** and may **further depress ventilation** in patients with **respiratory muscle weakness**.  
6. **Supplemental oxygen** should generally **not be prescribed** in patients with **chronic ventilatory failure** without concomitant **ventilatory support**.  
7. **Tracheostomy and home mechanical ventilation** may be appropriate for some patients with **advanced neuromuscular respiratory failure**, particularly those with **secretion management difficulties** or who require **daytime respiratory support**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Elevated Pco₂ with compensatory metabolic alkalosis indicates chronic hypoventilation and justifies BPAP initiation.  
2. Noninvasive ventilation is the first-line approach in neuromuscular respiratory failure before invasive options like tracheostomy.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation devices** are often prescribed to alleviate **sleep-related symptoms** and support **blood oxygen levels** in patients with **neuromuscular disorders**.  
2. **BPAP** or **volume-assured devices** (such as **average volume-assured pressure support**), either with or without **supplemental oxygen**, are indicated in the setting of **daytime hypercapnia** suggesting **chronic respiratory failure**.  
3. **Polysomnography** may be useful in optimizing **ventilator and oxygen settings** and identifying **concomitant sleep disorders**, though it is not always required.  
4. **Tracheostomy and home mechanical ventilation** are effective options and may be appropriate in some patients with **neuromuscular disease**.  
5. **Supplemental oxygen** may further **depress ventilation** in patients with **respiratory muscle weakness** and should generally not be prescribed without **ventilatory support**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Average volume-assured pressure support automatically adjusts inspiratory pressure to achieve a set tidal volume, providing more consistent ventilation than fixed-pressure BPAP.  
5. Oxygen therapy alone can worsen hypercapnia by reducing ventilatory drive in neuromuscular hypoventilation.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Positive Airway Pressure Modes)
1. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** provides a constant fixed airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle and is indicated to maintain **upper airway patency** in **obstructive sleep apnea**.  
2. **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)** delivers separate inspiratory and expiratory pressures, augments ventilation, and is indicated in **hypoventilation syndromes**, including those due to **neuromuscular disorders** with **chronic hypercapnia**.  
3. **Volume-assured pressure support devices** (e.g., average volume-assured pressure support) automatically adjust inspiratory pressure to achieve a preset tidal volume and provide **consistent ventilation** in **neuromuscular hypoventilation disorders**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. CPAP is not appropriate for ventilatory support in neuromuscular respiratory failure since it does not augment ventilation.  
2. BPAP’s separation of inspiratory and expiratory pressures directly improves alveolar ventilation.  
3. Volume-assured pressure support ensures more stable minute ventilation compared to fixed-pressure devices.
