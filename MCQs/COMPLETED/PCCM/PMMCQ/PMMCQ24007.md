### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Management of adverse effects of positive airway pressure therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Positive airway pressure therapy** can cause adverse effects such as discomfort, claustrophobia, throat irritation, xerostomia, and nasal congestion due to the desiccating effects of forced air.  
2. **In-line heated humidification** of forced air, available on all positive airway pressure machines, is an effective intervention to mitigate mucosal irritation, xerostomia, and nasal congestion.  
3. Patients can control the **air temperature and humidity** using in-line heated humidification, often leading to significant improvement in symptoms and better adherence to therapy.  
4. A **residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)** of 2 events per hour indicates good control of obstructive sleep apnea.  
5. If nasal congestion persists despite humidification, an **intranasal glucocorticoid** or **intranasal anticholinergic** may be indicated.  
6. **Intranasal ipratropium** can treat nasal congestion related to positive airway pressure therapy but is considered second-line after humidification.  
7. The role of **hypnotic medications** (eg, zaleplon) in promoting adherence to positive airway pressure therapy is controversial and they are not considered standard of care.  
8. **Key Point:** In-line heated humidification is available on all positive airway pressure machines and is an effective intervention to mitigate device-related mucosal irritation, xerostomia, and nasal congestion.  
9. **Key Point:** The role of hypnotic medications in promoting positive airway pressure adherence is controversial, and they are not considered standard of care.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Adverse effects from forced dry air are a common cause of poor adherence to otherwise effective positive airway pressure therapy.  
4. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is derived from data downloaded from the machine and is the most readily available objective clue to treatment failure.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Positive airway pressure (PAP)** is the most effective therapy for preventing disordered breathing events, alleviating symptoms, and improving sleep-related quality of life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.  
2. PAP works by **pressurizing the upper airway** to maintain luminal patency.  
3. **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** is titrated by a technologist during in-laboratory polysomnography.  
4. **Auto-adjusting PAP** is commonly used after diagnosis by home sleep apnea testing, using an algorithm to detect and overcome upper airway resistance in real time.  
5. CPAP and auto-adjusting PAP are considered **therapeutic equivalents** regarding adherence, apnea-hypopnea index reduction, and symptom improvement.  
6. **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP)**, which delivers separate inspiratory and expiratory pressures to augment alveolar ventilation, has no proven role in obstructive sleep apnea without concomitant hypoventilation syndrome.  
7. The effectiveness of PAP therapy depends heavily on **patient adherence**.  
8. **Educational programs** and direct-to-patient reports from the device to smartphones or computers can help improve adherence.  
9. Adverse effects such as **xerostomia, nasal dryness, and congestion** can be improved by in-line humidification.  
10. **Intranasal glucocorticoids or anticholinergics** may be useful for persistent nasal congestion or rhinitis despite humidification.  
11. **Modified pressure profiles** that vary pressure over a respiratory cycle may enhance patient comfort.  
12. A wide array of **PAP interfaces (masks)** is available to improve comfort and provide a cushion seal to reduce air leak.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
7. The effectiveness of PAP therapy is limited primarily by adherence, rather than efficacy of the device itself.
