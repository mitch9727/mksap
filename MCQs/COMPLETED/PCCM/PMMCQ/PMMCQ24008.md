### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with surgery

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Surgical procedures** are not first-line therapy for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** but can be effective in carefully selected patients.  
2. **Maxillomandibular advancement surgery** has been shown to significantly improve the **apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)**, even in severe OSA.  
3. A **higher body mass index (BMI)** reduces the efficacy of surgical treatments for OSA.  
4. Patients with OSA and a **BMI less than 40** who are unwilling or unable to use **positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy** should be considered for sleep surgery, such as maxillomandibular advancement.  
5. Referral for **bariatric surgery** is generally reserved for patients with a **BMI ≥40** or **BMI ≥35** with obesity-related comorbidities.  
6. **Weight loss** should be recommended to all patients with OSA who are overweight or obese.  
7. **Modafinil** is indicated for residual sleepiness in OSA only when primary therapy, such as PAP, has been optimized.  
8. **Oral appliances** are appropriate for **mild to moderate OSA (AHI <30 events/hour)** but are not clearly effective for severe OSA.  
9. **Key Point:** Surgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea can be considered for patients who do not benefit from or tolerate airway pressure therapy.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Other techniques for sleep surgery include **soft palatal procedures** and **hypoglossal nerve stimulation**.  
5. Patients with a **BMI of 33** do not qualify for bariatric surgery but should still be counseled on weight loss.  
8. Oral appliances often have **higher adherence rates** than PAP therapy in eligible patients.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. The **criteria for optimal candidacy** for surgical treatment of OSA are unclear.  
2. **Society guidelines** suggest referral for sleep surgery only in patients with **BMI less than 40**.  
3. **Soft palatal procedures** such as **uvulopalatopharyngoplasty** are of limited efficacy in reducing the AHI but may be an option in select patients.  
4. **Tonsillectomy** is rarely effective as a standalone treatment for OSA in adults.  
5. **Tracheotomy** is an effective treatment for OSA but is rarely used outside of patients requiring chronic ventilation due to limited acceptance and aesthetics.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty may be considered for selected OSA patients but does not reliably reduce AHI.  
5. Tracheotomy is considered primarily for patients with **chronic respiratory failure** who require long-term **mechanical ventilation**.
