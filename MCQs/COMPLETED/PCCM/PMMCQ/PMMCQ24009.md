### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** is an underrecognized cause of **pulmonary hypertension (PH)** because a history of prior **pulmonary embolism (PE)** is not always evident.  
2. Untreated CTEPH can lead to **right-sided heart failure** and death but is potentially treatable with **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy**.  
3. All patients with PH without an obvious cause should undergo evaluation for possible CTEPH.  
4. **Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning** is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test to evaluate for CTEPH in patients with PH of unclear cause.  
5. In the absence of parenchymal lung disease, a normal V/Q scan excludes CTEPH with a negative predictive value of 98%.  
6. Despite advances in **CT angiography (CTA)**, guidelines recommend V/Q scanning as the first-line test to rule out CTEPH.  
7. CT angiography is appropriate after an abnormal V/Q scan to identify vascular anomalies such as webs, intimal irregularities, and luminal narrowing.  
8. Assessment with a **6-minute walk test** provides prognostic and therapeutic response information in PH but does not differentiate causes of PH.  
9. **Pulmonary angiography** is invasive, costly, and associated with adverse effects, and its role in confirming CTEPH has been largely supplanted by CT angiography.  
10. **Key Point:** All patients suspected of having PH without an obvious cause should be evaluated for CTEPH with V/Q scanning, and a normal V/Q scan rules out CTEPH.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Previous thrombolytic therapy or mechanical thrombectomy for acute venous thromboembolism does not necessarily prevent CTEPH.  
3. In patients with prior PE, CTEPH should be considered if symptoms persist or recur after 3 months of anticoagulation.  
4. Echocardiography is the initial test of choice for evaluating suspected PH in patients with prior PE, followed by V/Q scanning if indicated.  
7. Pulmonary CTA may be less sensitive for detecting distal lesions compared with digital subtraction angiography.  
7. Current guidelines recommend screening for **antiphospholipid syndrome** in patients with CTEPH, but routine screening for other thrombophilic disorders is not recommended.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with precapillary PH, evaluation for CTEPH is warranted even without a history of acute PE.  
2. Guidelines recommend V/Q scanning over pulmonary CTA to rule out CTEPH in patients with PH of unclear cause.  
3. In the absence of parenchymal lung disease, a normal V/Q scan excludes CTEPH with a negative predictive value of 98%.  
4. When V/Q scanning suggests perfusion defects, additional imaging is needed to evaluate vascular anatomy and extent of disease.  
5. Digital subtraction angiography was historically the gold standard but has been largely replaced by pulmonary CTA, which is less invasive and offers excellent resolution.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Guidelines do not recommend universal CTEPH screening after acute PE, but the diagnosis should be considered in patients with persistent or new symptoms after 3 months of anticoagulation.  
5. Pulmonary CTA may be less sensitive for distal lesions compared with digital subtraction angiography.
