### 🫁 Pulmonary Hypertension: Initial Diagnostic Evaluation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is the best initial test in the evaluation of suspected **pulmonary hypertension (PH)**.
2. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is inexpensive, noninvasive, and able to assess parameters related to **right ventricular (RV) function** and **pulmonary artery pressure**.
3. **Echocardiography** allows estimation of whether a patient has a **high, intermediate, or low likelihood** of **pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)**, but no single parameter is highly specific.
4. If suspicion for **PAH** is **intermediate or high** after echocardiography, a **pulmonary artery catheterization** is indicated to confirm the diagnosis.
5. **Right heart catheterization** is invasive and should not precede echocardiography as a first-line test in suspected PH.
6. **Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning** is not a first-line test but should be considered if echocardiography suggests PH, to rule out **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)**.
7. Further testing for causes of **PH**, including **chronic lung disease**, **left heart disease**, and **CTEPH**, may be indicated depending on the clinical scenario.
8. Up to **10% of patients with PAH** have **heritable forms** of the disease, most commonly due to an **autosomal dominant variation in BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2)**, though penetrance is variable.
9. A **positive BMPR2 genetic test** does not confirm that symptoms are due to PAH, given its variable penetrance.
10. **Genetic testing** for PAH is important after the diagnosis is confirmed but is not the first step in evaluation.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Echocardiography provides an overall likelihood assessment but cannot definitively diagnose PH.  
2. Pulmonary artery catheterization provides accurate hemodynamic data.  
3. Penetrance of **BMPR2** mutation can be as low as **20% in men**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pulmonary vascular remodeling** is the key pathophysiologic process in **pulmonary hypertension (PH)**, leading to increased pulmonary artery pressures.
2. **Right ventricular (RV) remodeling and compensation** initially maintain cardiac output in PH, but eventually become inadequate, causing **RV failure symptoms**.
3. Classic symptoms of **PH** include **exertional dyspnea**, **lower extremity edema**, **chest pain**, **palpitations**, and sometimes **syncope**.
4. The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis of **PH** exceeds **2 years**, due to nonspecific presentation.
5. Physical examination in **PH** may reveal an **accentuated or persistently split S2** and a **tricuspid regurgitant murmur**.
6. Progressive **RV failure** in PH can manifest as **jugular venous distention, RV heave, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema**.
7. **Transthoracic echocardiography** should be performed when **PH is suspected**, but it provides only estimated pulmonary artery pressures and cannot confirm the diagnosis.
8. **Echocardiographic features of PH** include **elevated tricuspid regurgitant (TR) jet velocity**, **right atrial and RV enlargement**, **septal flattening**, and **decreased RV function**.
9. **Pulmonary artery catheterization** is essential to confirm a diagnosis of PH because it provides accurate hemodynamic data and distinguishes the primary cause of elevated pulmonary pressures.
10. Evaluation of suspected **PH** should include assessment for **left-sided heart disease**, **chronic lung disease**, and **CTEPH**, as these causes influence prognosis and treatment.
11. Additional recommended testing in **PH** includes **pulmonary function tests**, **high-resolution chest CT**, **ventilation-perfusion scanning**, and the **6-minute walk test** to assess functional status and prognosis.
12. Some patients with **pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)** may also have concomitant **left-sided heart disease**, and evaluation must account for multiple contributing factors.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Remodeling includes medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation, and adventitial changes in pulmonary arteries.  
2. Echocardiography is best used as a screening and stratification tool, not as diagnostic confirmation.  
3. The 6-minute walk test is widely used as both a prognostic and therapeutic response measure in PH.
