# 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) Nonsurgical Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy** is the only potentially curative therapy for **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** and normalizes pulmonary artery pressures and right ventricular function in up to one third of patients.  
2. Only about half of patients with **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** are eligible for **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy**.  
3. Patients with **nonoperative chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** or **persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension** after **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy** should receive **pulmonary vasodilator therapy** if tolerated and/or undergo **balloon pulmonary angioplasty**.  
4. **Riociguat**, a pulmonary vasodilator that acts on the **nitric oxide pathway**, is the **first-line oral treatment** for patients with **inoperable or persistent/recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** following **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy**.  
5. **Sildenafil**, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is an **alternative second-line therapy** for **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** but has **no demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes** compared with placebo.  
6. **Treprostinil**, a subcutaneous prostacyclin analogue, may **increase exercise capacity** in **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** and is **approved in Europe** and sometimes used **off-label in the United States**.  
7. For **symptomatic patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)**, management requires **lifelong anticoagulation plus a pulmonary vasodilator** (preferably **riociguat**) or **balloon pulmonary angioplasty**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Management of CTEPH
1. **Lifelong anticoagulant therapy** is indicated in **all patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** to prevent further thromboembolism.  
2. In patients with **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and antiphospholipid syndrome**, anticoagulation with **vitamin K antagonists** is recommended.  
3. All patients with **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** should undergo **surgical evaluation at an experienced center** for **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy**, regardless of disease severity.  
4. About **half of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** are eligible for **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy**, and about **one third of surgical patients** experience **normalization of pulmonary hemodynamics**.  
5. **Riociguat** is recommended for **symptomatic patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** or **persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension** after **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy**.  
6. **Balloon pulmonary angioplasty** is an **alternative option** for patients with **inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** or **persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension** after surgery.  
7. **Balloon pulmonary angioplasty** is **not recommended** as a substitute for **pulmonary thromboendarterectomy** in **operable patients** due to **insufficient data** showing equivalent outcomes.
