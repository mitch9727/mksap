### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Management of hypersensitivity pneumonitis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP)** results from repetitive inhalation of specific antigens in a sensitized patient, leading to noncaseating granuloma formation and peribronchial mononuclear and giant cell inflammation in the lungs.  
2. Bird fancier's lung disease is a form of **HP** caused by exposure to avian antigens in feathers, skin, or guano, and exposure may also occur from feather bedding.  
3. **Nonfibrotic HP** is characterized on CT by centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities.  
4. Untreated HP can progress to a **fibrotic form**, with the development of traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing.  
5. **Management of HP** is driven by symptoms, degree of respiratory function compromise, and radiographic findings.  
6. Identifying and removing the **offending antigen** is the most important step in managing HP.  
7. After removal of the antigen, patients with **mild nonfibrotic HP** can be monitored without further treatment.  
8. **Glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressives** may be necessary in patients with severe disease.  
9. Antifibrotic therapy (e.g., **nintedanib**) is reserved for patients with progressive fibrotic HP.  
10. **Surgical lung biopsy** is rarely indicated in suspected HP unless there is substantial diagnostic uncertainty.  
11. **Key Point:** The most important step in the management of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is identifying and removing the offending antigens.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Classification of HP is now based on the presence of fibrosis (fibrotic vs nonfibrotic) rather than acute, subacute, or chronic duration.  
3. High-resolution CT in nonfibrotic HP may also show **mosaic attenuation** and air trapping in addition to ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. The antigens responsible for hypersensitivity pneumonitis are typically complex proteins from agricultural dust, thermophilic fungi, and bacteria, but may also include low-molecular-weight organic compounds.  
2. **Symptoms of HP** are nonspecific and can include dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, fever, and weight loss.  
3. Serologic testing in HP is often limited, not standardized, and may not include antibodies to the responsible antigen.  
4. Signs of **fibrotic HP** on imaging include reticular abnormalities, architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, volume loss, and honeycombing.  
5. Diagnosis of HP often requires **multidisciplinary discussion** based on clinical, radiologic, and sometimes bronchoalveolar lavage findings.  
6. Transbronchial lung biopsy can confirm the diagnosis when uncertainty remains, though it is often unnecessary.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. A careful exposure history is crucial in evaluating suspected HP.  
4. Coexistent lung fibrosis with signs of bronchiolar obstruction strongly suggests fibrotic HP.
