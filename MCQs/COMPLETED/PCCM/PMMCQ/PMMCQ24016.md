### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is a **progressive and ultimately fatal fibrotic lung disease** with a **median survival of 3 to 5 years**.  
2. Diagnosis of **IPF** requires **exclusion of other causes of diffuse parenchymal lung disease** and demonstration of **bilateral, subpleural, basilar reticular changes** on imaging.  
3. **Subpleural basilar reticular and ground-glass opacities** on imaging are characteristic of **IPF**.  
4. Management of **IPF** includes consideration of **antifibrotic therapies** and **oxygen supplementation** for hypoxemia.  
5. **Nintedanib** is a **tyrosine kinase inhibitor** and **pirfenidone** is an **antifibrotic agent**; both are **first-line medical therapies** in IPF.  
6. **Nintedanib** and **pirfenidone** both **decrease disease progression** but are **not curative**.  
7. The clinical course of **IPF** is **unpredictable**, and patients may develop **acute exacerbations with accelerated decline**.  
8. **Referral to a specialist in IPF** is advisable upon diagnosis.  
9. **Early referral to a lung transplantation center** is strongly recommended in **IPF**.  
10. **Glucocorticoids such as prednisone** have **no role in long-term management of IPF**.  
11. **Glucocorticoids are sometimes used with antibiotics** for **acute exacerbations of IPF**, but evidence is limited.  
12. A **combination regimen of prednisone, N-acetylcysteine, and azathioprine** increases **hospitalizations and mortality** and is **not recommended** for IPF.  
13. **Surgical lung biopsy** is not indicated in **IPF** when **clinical and high-resolution CT findings are classic**, as results would not change management.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Exclusion includes autoimmune, occupational, and medication-related causes of diffuse parenchymal lung disease.  
12. A 2012 trial was stopped early due to harm from the prednisone + N-acetylcysteine + azathioprine combination.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is the most common idiopathic form of **diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD)** and is associated with the histopathologic pattern of **usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)**.  
2. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** reflects **dysregulated fibrosis in response to alveolar epithelial injury**.  
3. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** typically presents with **chronic cough and dyspnea** in patients aged **50 to 70 years**.  
4. Risk factors for **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** include **smoking**, **genetic factors**, and **male sex**.  
5. Patients with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** are often initially treated for **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** without improvement before diagnosis is made.  
6. **Lung examination** in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is notable for **bibasilar Velcro-like inspiratory crackles**.  
7. **Clubbing** is present in up to **50% of patients** with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
8. **Chest radiographs** in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may demonstrate **bibasilar reticular changes**.  
9. **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis demonstrates **bilateral, subpleural, and basal predominant reticular changes**.  
10. **Advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** may develop **traction bronchiectasis with honeycombing**.  
11. When **HRCT findings** are **classic for UIP**, a **lung biopsy** is not necessary for diagnosis.  
12. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** is progressive with a **median survival of 3 to 5 years** after diagnosis.  
13. Patients with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** may experience **acute exacerbations** with rapidly worsening symptoms and **bilateral ground-glass opacities** superimposed on background fibrosis.  
14. **Glucocorticoids and antibiotics** are frequently used in **acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**, but there are **no proven therapies**.  
15. **Management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** includes **antifibrotic therapies** and **oxygen supplementation** for hypoxemia.  
16. **Nintedanib**, a **tyrosine kinase inhibitor**, and **pirfenidone**, an **antifibrotic agent**, are approved therapies for **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**.  
17. **Nintedanib** and **pirfenidone** both **delay disease progression** but are **not curative**.  
18. Referral to a **pulmonologist or interstitial lung disease (ILD) center** is appropriate before initiating antifibrotic therapy.  
19. **Early referral to a lung transplantation center** is strongly recommended in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**, especially if there is **poor response to medical therapy**.  
20. **Palliative care consultation** should be considered in **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** patients who are **not candidates for lung transplantation**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. UIP is the pathologic correlate of IPF and defines its imaging and clinical course.  
13. Acute exacerbations may represent an acceleration of the underlying fibrotic process.  
16. Although their mechanisms differ, nintedanib and pirfenidone show similar clinical outcomes.  
20. Palliative care includes establishing advanced care plans for progressive disease.
