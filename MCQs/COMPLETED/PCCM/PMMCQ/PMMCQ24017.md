### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Management of Smoking-Related Interstitial Lung Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD)** is one of several diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs) that occur almost exclusively in individuals who smoke.  
2. High-resolution CT scan in RB-ILD shows **upper lobe–predominant ground-glass opacities with centrilobular nodules**.  
3. Pulmonary function testing in RB-ILD typically demonstrates a **combined restrictive and obstructive pattern** with reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco).  
4. The most important step in management of RB-ILD and all smoking-related DPLDs is **smoking cessation**, which may lead to disease regression.  
5. **Glucocorticoids** may be considered in patients with RB-ILD who have **refractory symptoms** or **severe disease** despite smoking cessation.  
6. **Nintedanib** is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and antifibrotic agent that is **first-line therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** and is also useful in systemic sclerosis–associated interstitial lung disease, but it does not have a role in RB-ILD.  
7. The **prognosis of RB-ILD is generally good**, and mortality is rare; lung transplantation is rarely necessary.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
4. Symptoms of RB-ILD often stabilize or improve after months or years with smoking cessation alone.  
5. A trial of glucocorticoids with prednisone is the next best step for patients with RB-ILD and significant persistent symptoms after smoking cessation.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Smoking-related DPLDs that occur almost exclusively in individuals who smoke include **RB-ILD, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH), and smoking-related interstitial fibrosis (SRIF)**.  
2. **Smoking may also contribute to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.  
3. **Desquamative interstitial pneumonia** shows **diffuse ground-glass opacification with lower-zone predominance** on high-resolution CT and **pure restrictive disease** on physiologic testing.  
4. **Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis** often occurs in younger patients, frequently causes pneumothorax, and shows **diffuse thin-walled cysts and nodular lesions in upper and mid-lung zones** on CT.  
5. Diagnosis of PLCH is confirmed by demonstrating **Langerhans cells with S100, CD207, or CD1a staining** on biopsy.  
6. **Smoking-related interstitial fibrosis (SRIF)** occurs in younger patients, has a less severe course than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and is pathologically distinct, with **hyalinized collagen in alveolar septa and minimal inflammation**.  
7. **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is a common comorbidity that may add an obstructive component on physiologic testing in smokers.  
8. For all smoking-related DPLDs, the **primary management is smoking cessation**, and glucocorticoids may be considered in **severe or refractory disease**.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. In SRIF, physiologic testing may show combined restriction and obstruction, similar to RB-ILD.
