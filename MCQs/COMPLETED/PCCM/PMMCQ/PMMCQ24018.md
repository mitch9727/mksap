### 🫁 Pulmonology: Pulmonary Sarcoidosis Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Sarcoidosis** is a **granulomatous disease of unknown cause** that can affect any organ system, with **>90% of patients having lung involvement**.
2. **Pulmonary sarcoidosis** is classified into **four stages** based on **chest radiograph appearance**.
3. **Treatment decisions** in pulmonary sarcoidosis are based on **symptoms and degree of organ dysfunction**, not radiographic findings.
4. **Glucocorticoids** such as **prednisone** are the **primary treatment** for **symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis**.
5. **Adjunctive glucocorticoid-sparing therapies** are used in pulmonary sarcoidosis if patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoids or remain symptomatic despite them.
6. **Surgical lung biopsy** is rarely warranted in suspected sarcoidosis because **bronchoscopic sampling** of lymph nodes or lung tissue has a **high diagnostic yield**.
7. **Clinical observation** without therapy is appropriate in pulmonary sarcoidosis patients **without symptoms or organ dysfunction**, as spontaneous resolution is common.
8. **Nintedanib**, an antifibrotic agent used in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and connective tissue disease–associated interstitial lung disease, **has no role in treating pulmonary sarcoidosis**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis shows **bilateral symmetric hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy** with **parenchymal involvement**.
7. The likelihood of spontaneous resolution in pulmonary sarcoidosis is related to the **radiographic stage**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Sarcoidosis
1. The **prevalence of sarcoidosis** is approximately **10–20 per 100,000 individuals**.
2. **More than 90%** of patients with sarcoidosis have **lung involvement**.
3. On imaging, **nodules along bronchovascular bundles on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** suggest sarcoidosis.
4. **Chest radiograph findings** can help predict the **probability of spontaneous resolution**.
5. **Pulmonary function testing** in sarcoidosis is typically **abnormal** and can show **obstructive, restrictive, or mixed patterns**.
6. **Sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion**, requiring noncaseating granulomas plus exclusion of infections (eg, mycobacteria, fungi) and other systemic granulomatous diseases.
7. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis ideally includes **evidence of involvement of more than one organ system**.
8. **Glucocorticoids** are the **primary treatment** of sarcoidosis, although many patients do **not require treatment**.
9. The decision to treat sarcoidosis and assessment of response should be based on **symptoms and organ dysfunction**, not radiographic findings.
10. **Pulmonary hypertension** in sarcoidosis is a **poor prognostic indicator**, with a **median survival of ~3 years**.
11. **Pulmonary consultation** should be considered for persistent sarcoidosis.
12. **Evaluation for lung transplantation** is appropriate in sarcoidosis with **pulmonary hypertension** or **severe disease with significant activity limitation**.

#### 💬 Extra
6. Bronchoscopic biopsy is the **usual diagnostic approach** for tissue confirmation in sarcoidosis, except in syndromes that do not require biopsy.
10. Pulmonary hypertension worsens prognosis in sarcoidosis independent of other lung involvement.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Radiographic Characteristics and Staging in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis)
1. **Stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis** shows **hilar lymphadenopathy with normal lung parenchyma** and has a **>90% spontaneous resolution rate** without treatment.
2. **Stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis** combines **hilar lymphadenopathy** with **abnormal lung parenchyma** and has an **~50% spontaneous improvement rate** without treatment.
3. **Stage III pulmonary sarcoidosis** features **abnormal lung parenchyma without lymphadenopathy** and has an **~20% spontaneous improvement rate** without treatment.
4. **Stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis** is characterized by **parenchymal fibrosis with architectural distortion**.
5. **Radiographic staging (0–IV)** does **not determine treatment**, which is based on **symptoms and organ dysfunction**.

#### 💬 Extra (Table: Radiographic Characteristics and Staging)
1. Spontaneous improvement rates **decrease** from stage I to stage III; stage IV reflects **fibrotic, less reversible disease**.
