### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis** is typically seen in survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and may manifest with chronic respiratory symptoms, imaging abnormalities, and functional limitation.
2. Lung fibrosis manifesting as **reticulation, parenchymal bands, bronchial dilation, and architectural distortion** is uncommon except as a sequela of severe COVID-19 disease.
3. The longitudinal course of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis is uncertain, with reports suggesting it may plateau or improve in some patients.
4. Rarely, post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis may be severe enough to warrant consideration for **lung transplantation**.
5. **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors** may cause a chronic dry cough but are not associated with drug-induced diffuse parenchymal lung disease.
6. **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)** is characterized histopathologically and radiologically by usual interstitial pneumonia, with honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, and peripheral alveolar septal thickening.
7. **Smoking-related diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD)** includes respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and smoking-related interstitial fibrosis.
8. **Key Point:** Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may develop post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis, characterized by imaging abnormalities such as reticulation, parenchymal bands, bronchial dilation, and architectural distortion.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Post-COVID fibrosis is more likely to develop in patients with a history of severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring prolonged hospitalization for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
6. Clinical and radiologic findings of post-COVID fibrosis may mimic those of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
7. Smoking-related diffuse parenchymal lung disease occurs almost exclusively in patients who smoke.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Characteristics of Drug-Induced Parenchymal Lung Diseases)
1. Amiodarone-induced lung disease presents with multiple radiographic abnormalities, has prolonged clearance, and often requires glucocorticoids with high risk of recurrence when tapered.
2. Methotrexate-induced lung disease occurs in fewer than 5% of patients, has unpredictable onset, and often improves with stopping medication; glucocorticoids are frequently used.
3. Acute nitrofurantoin-induced lung disease presents with systemic symptoms and often resolves with discontinuation, but recurs with re-exposure; chronic cases may show reticular opacities and sometimes benefit from glucocorticoids.
4. Epidermal growth factor receptor–targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause multiple lung injury patterns, often requiring drug withdrawal and glucocorticoids for severe cases.
5. Busulfan-induced lung disease occurs in fewer than 8% of patients, often after stem cell transplantation, and treatment is usually supportive; glucocorticoids may be used for progressive disease.
6. Bleomycin-induced lung disease risk is increased by cumulative dose, older age, kidney disease, chemotherapy, or irradiation, and it can present with multiple radiographic patterns; glucocorticoids are used in severe disease, but recurrence may occur with tapering.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
1. Amiodarone-induced lung disease may occur more commonly in older patients, with higher doses, or during the first year of therapy.
3. Peripheral eosinophilia is common in acute nitrofurantoin-induced lung disease.
4. Preexisting lung disease or radiation therapy increases the risk of immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced lung disease.
6. Bleomycin-induced lung disease can progress rapidly compared with usual interstitial pneumonia.
