### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)** typically presents subacutely with **cough, fever, and malaise** developing over weeks to months.
2. **Chest radiographs** in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia commonly show **patchy opacities that mimic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**.
3. Lack of response to **antibiotics** and persistence of symptoms should raise suspicion for **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia**.
4. **High-resolution chest CT (HRCT)** in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can show findings ranging from **ground-glass opacities** to **alveolar consolidation** that resemble infectious pneumonia.
5. The diagnosis of **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** requires exclusion of other infectious and noninfectious causes and demonstration of **consistent radiographic changes**.
6. **Lung biopsy** may not be necessary in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia if clinical and radiographic findings are typical, but when performed, it shows **granulation tissue forming intraluminal fibroblastic plugs** in **alveolar sacs, alveolar ducts, and bronchiolar lumen**.
7. The clinical presentation of **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** is often mistaken for **community-acquired pneumonia**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Because chest radiograph findings in COP closely resemble CAP, many patients are initially diagnosed with pneumonia.
6. The histopathologic pattern of **organizing pneumonia** confirms the diagnosis when needed.

#### ✅ True Statements — Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia
1. **Organizing pneumonia** is defined histopathologically by **patchy proliferation of granulation tissue** in **terminal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar spaces**, with associated surrounding inflammation.
2. The organizing pneumonia pattern is nonspecific and can follow or be associated with **lung injury from acute infection, radiation, drug-induced pneumonitis, or autoimmune disease**.
3. When no specific cause is identified, the condition is termed **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)**.
4. Patients with **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** typically present subacutely with **cough, dyspnea, fever, and malaise**.
5. **Chest radiographs** in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia often show **patchy opacities mimicking pneumonia**, leading to frequent initial misdiagnosis.
6. **Nonresolving symptoms** and **failure to improve with antibiotics** should raise suspicion for **cryptogenic organizing pneumonia**.
7. **High-resolution chest CT (HRCT)** findings in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia range from **ground-glass opacities** to **alveolar consolidation**.
8. **Lung biopsy** is not always required for diagnosis if clinical and HRCT findings are consistent, but it can help in atypical cases.
9. **Glucocorticoid therapy** is effective in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, with most patients showing a good response.
10. **Relapses** of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia are common during glucocorticoid tapering, and some patients may need **glucocorticoid-sparing therapies**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The histopathologic organizing pneumonia pattern can occur secondarily to multiple types of lung injury.
5. Because of these radiographic similarities, COP is frequently confused with infectious pneumonia.
9. Radiographic opacities often resolve completely with glucocorticoid treatment.
