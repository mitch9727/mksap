### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Management of Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE)** is a unique pathophysiologic entity distinct from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.  
2. In CPFE, the competing effects of emphysema and fibrosis result in **higher lung volumes** than occur in pulmonary fibrosis alone.  
3. The FEV1/FVC ratio in patients with CPFE may be preserved.  
4. CPFE causes an **additive deleterious effect on gas exchange**, manifested by a severe reduction in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco).  
5. **High-resolution CT** is the preferred diagnostic modality and typically reveals emphysematous changes in the upper lobes with fibrotic changes in the lower lobes similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  
6. Pulmonary hypertension is more common in CPFE than in either COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and portends a poor prognosis.  
7. **Lung transplantation** is the only curative therapy for CPFE.  
8. Antifibrotic agents such as **nintedanib** have no established role in CPFE management.  
9. **Glucocorticoids** may be used in acute exacerbations of COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but do not alter the chronic course of CPFE and carry significant adverse effects.  
10. **Surgical lung biopsy** is not indicated in CPFE when clinical and imaging findings are diagnostic, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension because of procedural risks.  
11. **Key Point:** Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema is characterized by CT demonstrating upper lobe emphysema and lower lobe fibrosis, and lung transplantation is the only curative therapy.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Pulmonary function tests may show higher lung volumes in CPFE because emphysema counterbalances restrictive effects of fibrosis.  
3. A preserved FEV1/FVC ratio may occur despite emphysema due to concurrent fibrotic restriction.  
10. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have increased complications from surgical lung biopsy.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Related Text)
1. CPFE is a distinct clinical entity wherein fibrotic lung disease similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis coexists with emphysema.  
2. In CPFE, pulmonary function testing may show higher lung volumes than in pulmonary fibrosis alone, and a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio may be present despite emphysema.  
3. CPFE typically shows marked impairment in gas exchange with reduced diffusing capacity.  
4. Pulmonary hypertension in CPFE portends a poor prognosis.  
5. Lung transplantation is the only curative therapy for CPFE.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Mixed findings on pulmonary function testing occur in CPFE because fibrosis and emphysema exert opposing physiologic effects.
