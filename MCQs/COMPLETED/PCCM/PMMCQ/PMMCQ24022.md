### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Evaluation of Suspected Occupational Lung Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Review of the **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** is a critical initial step when a patient develops **respiratory or other symptoms** after exposure to a **chemical** or other **potentially harmful workplace substance**.  
2. The **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** contains information on the **chemical properties** of substances used in the workplace.  
3. The **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** details **physical, health, and environmental hazards** posed by workplace chemicals.  
4. The **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** includes the **protective measures** advised for each workplace chemical.  
5. The **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** describes **safety precautions for handling, storing, and transporting** each workplace chemical.  
6. In the United States, the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** requires that **Safety Data Sheets (SDSs)** be available to employees working with potentially harmful chemicals.  
7. A first step in the evaluation of suspected **occupational lung disease** is to request and review the **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** for possible causation.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS) can develop after acute exposure to a chemical irritant, with symptoms appearing shortly after exposure.  
2. Occupational asthma differs from RADS in that it is often IgE-mediated, occurs primarily in the work environment, and may resolve when the patient is away from the workplace.
