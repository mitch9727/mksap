### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Asbestos-Related Pleuropulmonary Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease** most commonly occurs in individuals with occupational exposure to **asbestos**, such as **insulation installation**, **shipbuilding**, and **demolition** work.
2. **Amphibole asbestos**, used in **fireproofing** and **insulation**, is **more pathogenic** than **serpentine asbestos**.
3. Individuals typically develop **asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease** after a **latency period of more than 25 years** from exposure.
4. **Pulmonary parenchymal involvement** in asbestos-related disease can manifest as **diffuse pulmonary fibrosis**.
5. **Pleural involvement** in asbestos-related disease ranges from **benign processes** (**pleural thickening**, **pleural plaques**, **benign asbestos pleural effusion**) to **malignant transformation** (**malignant mesothelioma**).
6. Patients with **workplace asbestos exposure** typically develop **asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease** after a **latency period of more than 25 years**.
7. **Pulmonary asbestosis** can manifest as **diffuse pulmonary fibrosis** and **pleural disease**, with pleural manifestations including **pleural thickening**, **pleural plaques**, **benign asbestos pleural effusion**, and **malignant mesothelioma**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Diagnosis of asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease is supported by the **combination of occupational exposure**, a **long latency period**, and **classic radiologic findings**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **time course** from exposure to development of **signs and symptoms** of **occupational lung disease** is **highly variable**.
2. Exposures within the same industry can vary according to **protective practices** and the **type of workplace**.
3. **Coal worker's pneumoconiosis** in the United States has **substantially decreased** since the institution of **federal safety standards**.
4. Adequate determination of exposure requires a **clear description of job duties** and assessment of the **extent of exposure**.
5. A thorough history should include **additional exposures** from **hobbies** and the **home environment**.
6. When an **occupational lung disease** is suspected, clinicians should request a **Safety Data Sheet** from the employer, which details **chemical properties** and **known health risks** of workplace substances.
7. The U.S. **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** requires employers to make **Safety Data Sheets** available upon request for employees who work with **potentially harmful materials**.
8. Individuals with **undiagnosed disorders**, **persistent unexplained symptoms**, or **permanent impairment** possibly due to an **occupational lung disease** should be **referred** to an **occupational or environmental lung disease specialist**.

#### 💬 Extra
6. A **Safety Data Sheet** is a standardized document that includes **hazard identification**, **composition**, **safe handling**, and **risk information** for workplace substances.
