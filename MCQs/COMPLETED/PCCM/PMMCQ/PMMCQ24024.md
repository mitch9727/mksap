### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of Spontaneous Pneumothorax

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pneumothorax** can occur spontaneously or result from trauma or a procedure.
2. A **primary pneumothorax** occurs in someone without known underlying lung disease.
3. A **secondary pneumothorax** occurs in someone with an established lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. Symptoms of pneumothorax include sudden onset of **dyspnea** and **sharp pleuritic chest pain**.
5. Symptoms are typically more severe with secondary pneumothorax because patients have less respiratory reserve.
6. Prompt recognition of the signs and symptoms of pneumothorax is important to prevent deterioration.
7. When pneumothorax is suspected, patients who are **stable** from a respiratory and hemodynamic standpoint should undergo bedside **upright chest radiography** as the first test of choice.
8. Chest radiography will also quantify the size of the pneumothorax, which helps to direct treatment.
9. **Arterial blood gas studies** are indicated when it is necessary to assess acid-base status or partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, such as in suspected ventilatory failure.
10. In pneumothorax, arterial blood gas studies may show hypoxemia but do not help differentiate the cause of symptoms and are not necessary for diagnosis.
11. **Chest ultrasonography** is commonly used for suspected pneumothorax when patients are unstable and concern is present for tension physiology.
12. On chest ultrasonography, absence of lung slide and/or a lung point helps to diagnose pneumothorax.
13. A lung point is not always present, and other conditions can cause lack of lung slide on ultrasound.
14. For stable patients, chest radiography is the diagnostic modality of choice over ultrasonography.
15. **Chest computed tomography (CT)** is the most accurate modality to diagnose a pneumothorax because it can distinguish between bullae and pleural gas.
16. Chest CT should be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty but is not the best first step.
17. CT is a preferred test for many patients with possible pulmonary embolism, but pulmonary embolism would not explain pneumothorax findings on physical examination.
18. **Key Point:** When pneumothorax is suspected, patients who are stable from a respiratory and hemodynamic standpoint should undergo bedside upright chest radiography as the first test of choice.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
7. Upright chest radiography is performed at the bedside in stable patients.
11. Chest ultrasonography is particularly useful in unstable patients when tension physiology is suspected.
15. Chest CT can easily distinguish between bullae and pleural gas.

#### ✅ True Statements — Evaluation of Pneumothorax
1. **Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)** occurs **without underlying lung disease**, whereas **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP)** occurs **with underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
2. **Recurrence risk** after **primary spontaneous pneumothorax** is **23% to 50% over 1 to 5 years**.
3. **Recurrence risk** after **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax** is **greater than 50% over 1 to 3 years**.
4. Symptoms of **pneumothorax** include **sudden dyspnea** and **sharp pleuritic chest pain**, and symptoms are **typically more severe in secondary spontaneous pneumothorax**.
5. Physical examination in **pneumothorax** commonly shows **reduced lung expansion**, **hyperresonance to percussion**, and **diminished breath sounds** on the affected side.
6. **Tension pneumothorax** should be **suspected** when significant **cardiorespiratory distress** is present, including **worsening dyspnea**, **hypotension**, **absent breath sounds** on one side, **tracheal deviation**, and **distended neck veins**.
7. **Chest radiography** is an **appropriate initial test** for suspected pneumothorax because it can **confirm the diagnosis** and **determine pneumothorax size**.
8. On chest radiography, a **lung margin greater than 2 cm from the chest wall at the level of the hilum** defines a **large pneumothorax**.
9. **Computed tomography (CT)** is the **most sensitive** imaging modality for **small pneumothoraces**.
10. **Computed tomography (CT)** is **particularly useful** for evaluating pneumothorax in **bullous emphysema**.
11. **Thoracic ultrasonography** can aid diagnosis of pneumothorax; the **presence of lung sliding** at a scanned point indicates **no pneumothorax at that location**.
12. On thoracic ultrasonography, the **lung point** **confirms the edge** of a pneumothorax.
13. **Thoracic ultrasonography** is **indicated in unstable patients** with concern for **tension physiology**.
14. On thoracic ultrasonography, **lung sliding** represents **visceral pleura moving against parietal pleura with respiration**.
15. **Absent lung sliding** can occur **without pneumothorax** in the presence of **pulmonary blebs, inflammation, scarring, adhesions,** or **apnea**.
16. In **large pneumothorax**, a **lung point may not be identifiable** on ultrasonography.

#### 💬 Extra — Evaluation of Pneumothorax
8. The **>2 cm** threshold is measured **at the level of the hilum** on the chest radiograph.
11. **Lung sliding** excludes pneumothorax **only at the specific location scanned**.
12. Identification of a **lung point** is **specific** for pneumothorax and provides an estimate of **pneumothorax size**.
13. Point‑of‑care ultrasound is useful when immediate bedside assessment is needed for **hemodynamically unstable** patients.

  <video src="Lung Sliding Sign.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Lung Sliding Sign</strong>. Video ultrasound of the lung demonstrating the lung sliding sign, which excludes the diagnosis of pneumothorax at the point of scanning. Lung sliding represents visceral pleura moving against parietal pleura with respiration. If the sign is absent or nonspecific (in the absence of any lung disease), it indicates the presence of a pneumothorax. The lung sliding sign may also be absent in the presence of pulmonary blebs, inflammation, scarring, adhesions, and apnea.</figcaption>

  <video src="Lung Point Sign.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Lung Point Sign</strong>. Video ultrasound of the lung demonstrating the lung point sign. This sign can be used to identify a pneumothorax on ultrasonography. This is the point where the visceral pleura and parietal pleura (lung and chest wall) separate from each other because of the pneumothorax. In the absence of a pneumothorax, the two surfaces typically slide along each other (lung sliding sign). When air separates the two surfaces, lung sliding is absent (no sliding sign). The point between sliding and no sliding is the lung point; it is a specific sign for pneumothorax and suggests the size of the pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large, a lung point may not be found.</figcaption>
