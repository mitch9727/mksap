### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Screening for lung cancer in high-risk patients

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT** in patients aged **50 to 80 years** who have **at least a 20-pack-year smoking history**, including those who quit within the past 15 years.  
2. **Lung cancer screening** should be stopped once a patient has not smoked for **15 years**, or if the patient has **limited life expectancy** or would not undergo surgery.  
3. The **American Cancer Society (ACS)** recommends screening all patients with a smoking history who meet the criteria, regardless of when they last smoked.  
4. **Chest radiography** is not recommended for lung cancer screening, as studies have failed to show benefit.  
5. The **National Lung Screening Trial** demonstrated a **20% reduction in lung cancer mortality** in high-risk patients screened annually with low-dose CT compared with chest radiography.  
6. **Sputum cytology** should not be used for lung cancer screening.  
7. The **NELSON trial** and the **National Lung Screening Trial** both demonstrated that low-dose CT screening reduces lung cancer mortality.  
8. **Key Point:** The USPSTF recommends annual low-dose CT lung cancer screening in patients aged 50 to 80 years with a 20-pack-year smoking history, including those who quit within the past 15 years. Chest radiography and sputum cytology should not be used.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Screening should not be delayed until age 60 years, because the USPSTF recommends initiating screening at age 50 years.
