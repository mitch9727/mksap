### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Malignant Pleural Effusion Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cytologic examination of pleural fluid** has an overall sensitivity of **60%** for detecting cancer.  
2. Pleural fluid cytology sensitivity is **84% for adenocarcinoma**, **40% for lymphoma**, **29% for mesothelioma**, and **24% for squamous cell carcinoma**.  
3. **Thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy under direct visualization** has a sensitivity **greater than 90%** for diagnosing malignant pleural disease.  
4. **Closed pleural biopsy** without image guidance is **less sensitive** than pleural fluid cytology and has been replaced by thoracoscopy.  
5. **Obtaining more than two pleural fluid samples for cytology** in suspected malignant pleural effusion offers **minimal additional diagnostic benefit**.  
6. **High-resolution chest CT (HRCT)** is primarily indicated for **interstitial lung disease** and is **not useful for pleural malignancy evaluation**.  
7. **Standard chest CT with contrast** can be used after thoracentesis to evaluate **pleura and parenchyma for malignancy**, but **HRCT should not be used**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Pleural malignancy suspicion should prompt thoracoscopy if cytology is negative, particularly with risk factors such as **smoking** and **prior breast cancer**.  
4. Image-guided closed pleural biopsy with **ultrasound or CT** can be attempted in cases of pleural nodularity or thickening before thoracoscopy.  
6. HRCT has thicker slices but skips intervals, making it unsuitable for evaluation of lung nodules or pleural disease.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Pleural fluid cytology has an **average sensitivity of 60%** for detecting malignancy, with higher yield in **adenocarcinoma (84%)** and lower in **lymphoma (40%)**, **squamous cell carcinoma (24%)**, and **mesothelioma (29%)**.  
2. Submitting **more than two pleural fluid samples** for cytology in suspected malignant pleural effusion provides **minimal added diagnostic value**.  
3. If pleural fluid cytology is **negative but malignancy is suspected**, a **pleural biopsy** should be performed.  
4. **Thoracoscopy with direct visualization** has a **diagnostic sensitivity greater than 90%** for detecting malignant pleural disease.  
5. **Image-guided closed pleural biopsy** with **ultrasound or CT** may be considered in cases of pleural nodularity or thickening before thoracoscopy.  
6. **Closed pleural biopsy without image guidance** is **less sensitive than fluid cytology** and has been replaced by **thoracoscopy or image-guided biopsy** in the evaluation of pleural malignancy.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Diagnostic sensitivity varies substantially by tumor type, with adenocarcinoma most likely to be detected.  
5. Ultrasound or CT guidance improves diagnostic yield by targeting nodularity or thickening rather than random sampling.
