### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax Treatment

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Spontaneous pneumothorax** is classified as a **primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)** in the absence of underlying lung disease or as a **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP)** when it occurs in the setting of underlying lung disease, such as **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
2. In **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP)**, the recurrence rate of an ipsilateral pneumothorax is as high as **39%**.
3. In patients with **underlying lung disease** who have a **first episode of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax**, **pleurodesis** is indicated to prevent recurrence.
4. **Chemical pleurodesis** involves instillation of a **sclerosing agent**, such as **talc**, into the pleural space.
5. **Mechanical pleurodesis** involves **mechanical abrasion** of the pleural membranes through **thoracoscopy**.
6. In patients with **severe COPD** and **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax**, **chemical pleurodesis** is preferred because such patients are **poor surgical candidates**.
7. An **autologous blood patch pleurodesis** involves instilling a sample of the patient's blood into the pleural space through a **thoracostomy tube**, followed by hanging the chest drain above the patient’s head for **1–2 hours** to prevent drainage of blood or thrombus through the tube.
8. **Autologous blood patch pleurodesis** is typically used for a **persistent air leak** after pneumothorax, not after a first episode without persistent leak.
9. **Endobronchial valves**, which allow air to exit but not enter the damaged area of the lung, are a **second-line therapy** for pneumothorax with **persistent air leak**.
10. Removal of a **thoracostomy tube alone** is appropriate in a patient with **primary spontaneous pneumothorax** after a first episode, but it is **inappropriate** in **secondary spontaneous pneumothorax** due to high recurrence risk and severe underlying disease.

#### 💬 Extra
2. The high recurrence rate justifies offering definitive therapy after the first SSP.
6. Mechanical pleurodesis requires surgery, which is often contraindicated in severe COPD.
7. The chest tube is positioned to prevent clot evacuation and facilitate pleural adhesion.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Figure: Blood Patch Protocol from Mayo Clinic)
1. **Autologous blood patch pleurodesis** uses a **chest tube (CT)** for instillation.  
2. **Intravenous (IV) access** is required for the blood draw during autologous blood patch pleurodesis.  
3. **Normal saline (NS)** is part of the protocol for autologous blood patch pleurodesis.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The chest tube provides the route for introducing autologous blood into the pleural space.  
2. Fresh autologous blood is obtained directly via IV access to instill into pleural cavity.  
3. Normal saline may be used for flushing or dilution during the instillation procedure.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Clinical symptoms** drive the **management of pneumothorax**.  
2. **Tension pneumothorax** (large and hemodynamically compromising) should be treated with **emergent needle thoracostomy** followed by **thoracostomy tube placement** and **hospitalization**.  
3. **Observation alone** is safe for **small** and **moderate to large pneumothoraces** in otherwise **healthy patients with minimal symptoms**.  
4. **Smoking cessation** should be encouraged in patients with **primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)**, because the **lifetime incidence** is much higher in **lifelong heavy smokers (12%)** compared with **never-smokers (0.1%)**.  
5. **Recurrence prevention** is recommended after the **second episode of PSP** on the **ipsilateral side** or after the **first occurrence of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP)**.  
6. Interventions to prevent recurrence of **spontaneous pneumothorax** include **chemical pleurodesis** and **mechanical pleurodesis**.  
7. **Endobronchial valves** and **autologous blood patches** are considered **second-line therapies** when a **persistent air leak** is present.  
8. Patients should avoid **air travel** until the **pneumothorax completely resolves**.  
9. **Scuba diving** is generally **not recommended** after a **spontaneous pneumothorax**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. The emphasis on symptoms aligns with the BTS pleural guideline, which prioritizes clinical stability over size alone.  
4. Smoking markedly increases the risk of recurrence of **primary spontaneous pneumothorax**.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Management of Pneumothorax Based on Size and Clinical Symptoms)
1. Patients with **minimal symptoms** and **clinical stability**, regardless of pneumothorax size, should be managed with **hospitalization for observation** and **supplemental oxygen**.  
2. **Outpatient management** of **primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)** may be considered if there is **good access to medical care**.  
3. For a pneumothorax **greater than 2 cm on chest radiograph** or with **significant symptoms** (such as **dyspnea** or **chest pain**), management options include **needle aspiration**, **insertion of an ambulatory device**, or **insertion of a small-bore (<14 Fr [4.7 mm]) thoracostomy tube** with connection to a **high-volume, low-pressure suction system**.  
4. Patients with **cardiovascular compromise** (such as **hypotension** or **increasing breathlessness**) should undergo **emergent needle decompression** followed by **thoracostomy tube insertion**.  
5. If there is a **persistent air leak lasting longer than 48 hours**, referral to an **interventional pulmonologist** or **thoracic surgeon** is recommended.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Supplemental oxygen increases the gradient for nitrogen absorption, accelerating resolution of pleural air.  
3. The threshold of **>2 cm** is measured between the **lung and chest wall** at the **level of the hilum**.
