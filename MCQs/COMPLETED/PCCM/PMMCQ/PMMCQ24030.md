### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Evaluation of Incidentally Detected Pulmonary Nodules

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The evaluation of a **single pulmonary nodule** requires **review of imaging history**, **estimation of the probability of malignancy**, and **discussion of management preferences** with the patient.
2. For **incidentally noted single pulmonary nodules smaller than 6 mm** in patients at **low risk for lung cancer**, **no follow-up is required**.
3. **Nodules 8 mm or smaller** have a lower probability of malignancy, are difficult to biopsy, and are not reliably characterized by **positron emission tomography (PET)**.
4. Follow-up of **small pulmonary nodules (≤8 mm)**, when necessary, is usually performed by **serial chest computed tomography (CT)**.
5. **Chest CT in 6 to 12 months** is appropriate for **6 to 8 mm nodules** in low- or high-risk patients, but not for **nodules <6 mm** in low-risk patients.
6. **PET/CT** is not indicated for nodules **smaller than 8 mm** because they are below the spatial resolution of **fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Low risk is defined by factors such as **younger age**, **no smoking history**, **no family history of lung cancer**, and **favorable nodule features** (small size, regular margins, lower lobe location).
3. PET/CT is reserved for **solid nodules with moderate or high probability of malignancy**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. On imaging, **pulmonary nodules** are defined as **small opacities <3 cm** surrounded by normal lung parenchyma, whereas a **focal opacity >3 cm** is considered a **lung mass** and presumed malignant until proved otherwise.
2. **Pulmonary nodules** are frequently detected **incidentally** because of the high use of **chest CT** for other indications.
3. **Lung masses (>3 cm)** should be presumed **malignant until proved otherwise**.
4. When multiple pulmonary nodules are present, **follow-up is determined by the largest lesion**.
5. A **well-demarcated, centrally or fully calcified nodule** usually represents a **previous infectious granuloma** and is considered **benign**.
6. Common infectious causes of **benign granulomatous nodules** include **endemic fungi** (e.g., histoplasmosis) and **mycobacteria** (e.g., tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria).
7. **Subsolid nodules**, including **pure ground-glass** and **part-solid nodules**, often represent **premalignant adenocarcinoma in situ** and may grow very slowly, with doubling times between **400–800 days**.
8. **Development or growth of a solid component** in a **subsolid nodule** suggests **malignancy**.
9. **Subsolid nodules** are not reliably characterized by **PET/CT**, and **nonsurgical biopsies** have limited sensitivity.
10. The **Brock model** and similar prediction calculators estimate malignancy risk based on factors such as **age, sex, smoking history, nodule size, lung location, and border morphology**.
11. **Solid nodules >8 mm** with moderate risk should be further characterized with **PET/CT**, with management based on results.
12. **Solid nodules >8 mm** with high risk should be staged with **PET/CT** followed by **definitive management** (e.g., resection, chemotherapy, radiation).

    <strong>Radiographic Evolution of Part-Solid Pulmonary Nodule.</strong>  
    Radiographs show a part-solid, part–ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe (A); growth in the solid component at 1 year (B); an increase in the ground-glass component at 4 years (C); and further growth of the solid component at 6 years (D). This slow growth pattern is characteristic of part-solid nodules progressing from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma.
