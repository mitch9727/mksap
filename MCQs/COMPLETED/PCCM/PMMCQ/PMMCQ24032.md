### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Management of a Pure Ground-Glass Lung Nodule

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **recommended follow-up** for a pure ground-glass lung nodule larger than 6 mm is CT at 6–12 months, then repeat CT every 2 years for a total of 5 years.  
2. **Ground-glass nodules** can be very slow growing but often represent **premalignant disease**.  
3. **Development of a solid component** within a pure ground-glass nodule or enlargement of an existing solid component suggests **cancer** and requires more frequent follow-up or intervention.  
4. **PET/CT** is not useful for evaluating pure ground-glass nodules because of their **low metabolic activity**, and nodules 8 mm or smaller are not reliably characterized by PET/CT.  
5. **Repeat CT at 1 year** after a prior stable 12-month scan is not recommended because such a short interval is unlikely to show meaningful change.  
6. **No further testing** is inappropriate for pure ground-glass nodules because they require **5 years of surveillance** due to premalignant potential.  
7. **Key Point:** The recommended follow-up schedule for a pure ground-glass nodule larger than 6 mm is CT at 6–12 months and then every 2 years until 5 years.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Ground-glass nodules have **doubling times of 400–800 days**, which explains the extended follow-up schedule.  
4. PET/CT is widely used for staging thoracic tumors and metastatic disease, but not for characterizing small ground-glass nodules.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **pulmonary nodule** is a small opacity less than 3 cm in diameter, surrounded by normal lung, and usually asymptomatic.  
2. A pulmonary opacity larger than 3 cm is a **lung mass** and presumed malignant until proved otherwise.  
3. Management of pulmonary nodules is guided by **size and imaging characteristics**, with follow-up based on the largest lesion when multiple are present.  
4. A well-demarcated, fully or centrally **calcified nodule** usually represents a benign infectious granuloma.  
5. Solid nodules larger than 8 mm require **malignancy risk estimation** before management.  
6. The **Brock model** estimates malignancy risk in pulmonary nodules and has high negative predictive value.  
7. Solid nodules with **moderate probability** of malignancy should be further characterized with PET/CT.  
8. Solid nodules with **high probability** of malignancy require PET/CT for staging and then surgical resection or systemic therapy.  
9. Solid nodules 8 mm or smaller are difficult to biopsy and not reliably characterized by PET; they are usually followed with serial CT.  
10. **Subsolid nodules** cannot be reliably characterized by PET, and nonsurgical biopsies have limited sensitivity.  
11. Development or enlargement of a **solid component** in a ground-glass nodule suggests malignancy.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Pulmonary nodules are increasingly detected because of widespread CT imaging for other reasons.  
3. Shared decision-making is important in pulmonary nodule management.  
5. Estimating malignancy probability helps decide between surveillance, PET/CT, or invasive evaluation.  
9. Follow-up intervals for small nodules follow **Fleischner Society guidelines**.  
11. Subsolid nodules often represent **premalignant disease such as adenocarcinoma in situ**, which can grow slowly with doubling times of 400–800 days.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Fleischner Society Recommendations for Single Pulmonary Nodule Follow-Up)
1. Low-risk patients with nodules <6 mm require no follow-up.  
2. Low-risk patients with nodules 6–8 mm should have CT at 6–12 months, then consider CT at 18–24 months.  
3. Low-risk patients with nodules >8 mm should have CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling.  
4. High-risk patients with nodules <6 mm may have optional CT at 12 months.  
5. High-risk patients with nodules 6–8 mm should have CT at 6–12 months and again at 18–24 months.  
6. High-risk patients with nodules >8 mm should have CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling.  

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. More frequent follow-up reflects the higher malignancy risk in larger nodules.  
4. Optional CT follow-up for <6 mm nodules balances risk with radiation exposure.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Fleischner Society Recommendations for Solitary Subsolid Lung Nodule Follow-Up)
1. Pure ground-glass nodules <6 mm require no follow-up.  
2. Pure ground-glass nodules ≥6 mm should have CT at 6–12 months, then every 2 years until 5 years.  
3. Part-solid nodules <6 mm require no follow-up.  
4. Part-solid nodules ≥6 mm should have CT at 3–6 months; if unchanged and the solid component remains <6 mm, annual CT for 5 years is recommended.  

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. Persistence of pure ground-glass nodules ≥6 mm suggests premalignant potential.  
4. Long-term follow-up of part-solid nodules is needed because of their slow malignant potential.
