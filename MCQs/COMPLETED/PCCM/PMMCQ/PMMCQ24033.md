### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of benign pulmonary nodule

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A smooth, well-demarcated, fully calcified **pulmonary nodule** requires no further follow-up testing.
2. A completely calcified pulmonary nodule is typically an infectious granuloma indicating an inactive previous infection.
3. Infectious granulomas usually appear as well-demarcated and fully or centrally calcified nodules.
4. The most common causes of infectious granulomas are endemic fungi, such as **histoplasmosis**, and mycobacteria, such as **tuberculosis** or nontuberculous mycobacteria.
5. Benign pulmonary nodules can also result from benign tumors, vascular lesions, or inflammatory lesions.
6. **Pulmonary hamartomas** are benign tumors that can present as nodules with “popcorn” calcification or as focal areas of fat alternating with calcification.
7. Other benign tumors that may present as pulmonary nodules include fibromas, leiomyomas, hemangiomas, and amyloidomas.
8. Inflammatory disorders such as **granulomatosis with polyangiitis**, **rheumatoid arthritis**, and **sarcoidosis** can cause pulmonary nodules.
9. CT-guided biopsy is useful for obtaining tissue samples from peripheral pulmonary lesions that are safely approached with transthoracic needle aspiration.
10. PET/CT is used to further characterize solid pulmonary nodules with a moderate probability of malignancy.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Recognizing benign nodule characteristics helps avoid unnecessary testing and associated harm.
6. Not all benign tumors have a distinct radiographic appearance, unlike hamartomas.
8. The clinical presentation and systemic disease features often help identify inflammatory causes of pulmonary nodules.
9. CT-guided biopsy is not indicated for nodules with benign features.
10. PET/CT is unnecessary for nodules with classic benign imaging features.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **pulmonary nodule** is a small opacity less than 3 cm in diameter, surrounded by normal lung parenchyma, and typically asymptomatic.
2. A focal pulmonary opacity larger than 3 cm is considered a **lung mass** and presumed malignant until proved otherwise.
3. Management of pulmonary nodules is based on size and imaging characteristics, with follow-up determined by the largest lesion when multiple nodules are present.
4. A well-demarcated and fully or centrally calcified nodule usually represents a benign infectious granuloma.
5. Solid nodules larger than 8 mm require estimation of malignancy probability before further management.
6. The **Brock model** is a quantitative tool that estimates malignancy risk in pulmonary nodules, with high negative predictive value.
7. Solid nodules with moderate probability of malignancy should be further characterized with PET/CT.
8. Solid nodules with high probability of malignancy require PET/CT for staging, followed by surgical resection or systemic therapy.
9. Solid nodules 8 mm or smaller are difficult to biopsy and not reliably characterized by PET; they are usually followed with serial CT scans.
10. Subsolid nodules cannot be reliably characterized by PET, and nonsurgical biopsies have limited sensitivity.
11. Development or enlargement of a solid component in a ground-glass nodule suggests malignancy.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Pulmonary nodules are increasingly detected due to frequent use of CT imaging for other indications.
3. Shared decision-making is an important part of pulmonary nodule management.
5. Estimating the probability of malignancy guides the choice between surveillance, PET/CT, and invasive evaluation.
9. Recommended follow-up intervals for small nodules are based on Fleischner Society guidelines.
11. Subsolid nodules often represent premalignant disease such as adenocarcinoma in situ, which can grow slowly with doubling times of 400–800 days.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Fleischner Society Recommendations for Single Pulmonary Nodule Follow-Up)
1. Low-risk patients with a nodule smaller than 6 mm require no follow-up.
2. Low-risk patients with a nodule 6–8 mm should have CT at 6–12 months, then consider CT at 18–24 months.
3. Low-risk patients with a nodule larger than 8 mm should have CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling.
4. High-risk patients with a nodule smaller than 6 mm may have optional CT at 12 months.
5. High-risk patients with a nodule 6–8 mm should have CT at 6–12 months and again at 18–24 months.
6. High-risk patients with a nodule larger than 8 mm should have CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. The frequency of follow-up reflects the higher risk of malignancy in larger nodules.
4. Optional follow-up in high-risk patients with nodules <6 mm balances risk with radiation exposure.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Fleischner Society Recommendations for Solitary Subsolid Lung Nodule Follow-Up)
1. Pure ground-glass nodules smaller than 6 mm require no follow-up.
2. Pure ground-glass nodules 6 mm or larger should have CT at 6–12 months to confirm persistence, then CT every 2 years until 5 years.
3. Part-solid nodules smaller than 6 mm require no follow-up.
4. Part-solid nodules 6 mm or larger should have CT at 3–6 months to confirm persistence; if unchanged and the solid component remains smaller than 6 mm, annual CT for 5 years is recommended.

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
2. Persistence of pure ground-glass nodules ≥6 mm suggests risk for premalignant disease.
4. Long-term follow-up of part-solid nodules is needed because of their slow but malignant potential.
