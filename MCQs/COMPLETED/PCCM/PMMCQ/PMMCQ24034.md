### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Airway Obstruction and Flow-Volume Loops

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Flow-volume loops** can localize anatomic sites of airway obstruction.  
2. A **flattened expiratory flow limb** on spirometry suggests an **intrathoracic airway obstruction**.  
3. A **flattened inspiratory flow limb** on spirometry suggests an **extrathoracic airway obstruction**.  
4. A **fixed airway obstruction** results in **flattening of both inspiratory and expiratory flow limbs**.  
5. **Chest computed tomography (CT)** is the most appropriate test to confirm an **intrathoracic airway obstruction** because it allows direct visualization of the airways.  
6. Causes of **variable extrathoracic obstruction** include **tracheomalacia**, **tumors**, and **vocal fold paralysis**.  
7. Causes of **variable intrathoracic obstruction** include **intrathoracic tumors** and **tracheomalacia**.  
8. **Tracheal stenosis** or **tumor** usually causes **fixed obstruction**.  
9. Patients with a **focal wheeze** should undergo **chest CT** to rule out an **endobronchial lesion**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. Flow-volume loops graphically represent **maximally forced inspiratory and expiratory flow (Y-axis)** versus **volume (X-axis)**.  
2. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing assesses **airway inflammation** in **asthma** and **nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis**, but it is not indicated when obstruction is suspected.  
3. Laryngoscopy is the test of choice for **inducible laryngeal obstruction (vocal cord dysfunction)**, which causes **flattening of the inspiratory limb** (extrathoracic pattern).

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Pulmonary function testing classifies abnormal results as **obstructive**, **restrictive**, or **mixed obstructive/restrictive**, and assesses **severity of impairment**.  
2. A **reduced FEV1/FVC ratio** is consistent with **obstruction**.  
3. The **American Thoracic Society (ATS)** and **European Respiratory Society (ERS)** define a reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** as **below the lower limit of normal**.  
4. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)** defines a reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** as **below 0.70** on a postbronchodilator test.  
5. According to the 2021 **ATS/ERS technical standard**, bronchodilator responsiveness is defined as an **increase from baseline in FEV1, FVC, or both of at least 10% relative to predicted value**.  
6. Many laboratories still use the older criteria for bronchodilator responsiveness (**≥12% and ≥200 mL increase**).  
7. **Elevation of total lung capacity (TLC)** and **residual volume ≥120% of predicted** indicates **hyperinflation and air trapping**, a common finding in **severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.  
8. If **FEV1 or FVC is reduced** and the **FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.70**, a **restrictive pattern** is suspected; confirmation requires **TLC <80% of predicted**.  
9. **Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema** shows both a **low TLC (restrictive)** and a **low FEV1/FVC ratio (obstructive)**.  
10. **Obesity** often causes **reduced lung volumes (FEV1 and FVC)**, but with a **preserved FEV1/FVC ratio** and modest reductions in TLC and expiratory reserve volume.  
11. **Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco)** is reduced when alveolar-capillary units are destroyed (e.g., **COPD**), infiltrated (e.g., **diffuse parenchymal lung disease**), or resected, or when function is compromised by **pulmonary vascular disease**.  
12. **Dlco** is increased in conditions that raise pulmonary capillary blood volume, such as **pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage**, **left-to-right shunt**, or **asthma**.  

#### 💬 Extra
5. The shift in bronchodilator response definition reflects new ATS/ERS standards, but many clinical labs have not yet adopted them.  
7. **Hyperinflation and air trapping** are physiologic hallmarks of **advanced COPD**.  
12. Elevated Dlco may serve as a clue in diseases with increased pulmonary blood volume rather than parenchymal damage.
