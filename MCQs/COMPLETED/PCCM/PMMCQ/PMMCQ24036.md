### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Acute Mountain Sickness Prophylaxis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Acute mountain sickness (AMS)** occurs with ascent to altitude due to lower barometric pressure and resultant hypobaric hypoxemia.
2. Symptoms of **acute mountain sickness** include **headache**, **fatigue**, **nausea**, and **sleep disruption**, and they typically resolve within **24 to 48 hours**.
3. Symptoms such as **mental status changes** and **dyspnea** are **not seen in acute mountain sickness** and should prompt consideration of **high-altitude cerebral edema** or **high-altitude pulmonary edema**.
4. **Acute mountain sickness** affects up to **25% of visitors** to elevations greater than **2000 meters (6562 feet)**.
5. **Gradual ascent**, avoidance of **heavy exertion**, and avoidance of **alcohol consumption** decrease the incidence and severity of **acute mountain sickness**.
6. **Acetazolamide** is effective in the **prevention of acute mountain sickness**.
7. **Adverse effects** of acetazolamide include **paresthesia** and **inability to sense carbonation** in carbonated beverages.
8. Persons who have had **acute mountain sickness before** and who are ascending to elevations above **2500 meters (8202 feet)** should be offered **prophylaxis with acetazolamide**, especially if **rapid ascent** is planned.
9. **Hydrochlorothiazide** has never been studied in **acute mountain sickness** and is **not indicated**.
10. **Ibuprofen** and **aspirin** may treat headache in **acute mountain sickness**, but they have **no proven role in prevention**.
11. **Nifedipine** can be used in prevention of **high-altitude pulmonary edema**, but it is **not indicated for prevention of acute mountain sickness**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as **vomiting** may also accompany acute mountain sickness, but are nonspecific.
6. The mechanism by which acetazolamide accelerates acclimatization is unclear.
11. **High-altitude pulmonary edema** typically occurs at **altitudes >2500 meters**, usually **2 to 4 days** after arrival, distinguishing it from **acute mountain sickness**, which occurs within **hours**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Acute Mountain Sickness
1. **Acute mountain sickness** is the most common **high altitude–related illness**, affecting up to **25% of visitors** to altitudes of **2000 meters (6500 feet)**.
2. **Cerebral blood flow** and **oxygen delivery to the brain** are altered by **hypoxia** and **hypocapnia** during ascent to altitude.
3. **High-altitude periodic breathing** occurs when **hypoxia-sensitive chemoreceptors** increase ventilation, leading to **hypocapnia**, which drives arterial Pco₂ below the apneic threshold and results in **central apnea**.
4. The cycle of **ventilatory overshoot**, **hypocapnia**, and **central apneas** repeats frequently at night at altitude.
5. **Symptoms of acute mountain sickness** are nonspecific and include **headache**, **fatigue**, **nausea**, and **vomiting**.
6. **High-altitude periodic breathing** can cause **interrupted sleep**, **insomnia**, and **paroxysms of dyspnea** that awaken individuals.
7. **Heavy exertion** and **dehydration** amplify symptoms of **acute mountain sickness**.
8. **Alcohol ingestion** worsens **high-altitude periodic breathing** by promoting **dehydration**.
9. In the absence of further ascent, symptoms of **acute mountain sickness** typically resolve within **24 to 48 hours**.

#### 💬 Extra
3. Central apnea at altitude is due to the arterial Pco₂ crossing the apneic threshold during overventilation.
6. **Paroxysms of dyspnea** are distinct from persistent dyspnea of **high-altitude pulmonary edema**.
