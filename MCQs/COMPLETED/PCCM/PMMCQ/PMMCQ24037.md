### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of Asthma  

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. Diagnosis of **asthma** requires confirmation of **reversible airflow obstruction**, not just symptoms and examination.  
2. Confirmation of reversible airflow obstruction can be obtained by **spirometry measuring FEV₁, FVC, and the FEV₁/FVC ratio** or by **serial home peak expiratory flow rates**.  
3. An increase in **FEV₁ or FVC of ≥10%** from baseline after bronchodilator therapy, or **peak flow fluctuations ≥20%**, supports the diagnosis of asthma.  
4. If airflow obstruction is not present during initial evaluation, **bronchial challenge testing** is indicated.  
5. A **positive bronchial challenge test** confirms bronchial hyperreactivity but does not confirm asthma; clinical correlation with symptoms is required.  
6. A **negative bronchial challenge test** makes the diagnosis of asthma unlikely.  
7. **Short-acting β₂-agonist therapy** alone for mild asthma increases the risk for serious exacerbations; all patients with asthma should be treated with an **inhaled glucocorticoid** or **inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol**.  
8. **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing** is limited by sensitivity and specificity and should not be used alone to diagnose asthma.  
9. **Low-dose budesonide–formoterol** is appropriate for mild asthma only once the diagnosis is confirmed.  
10. **Key Point:** Diagnosis of asthma requires confirmation of reversible airflow obstruction by spirometry or bronchial challenge testing.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)  
2. Home peak expiratory flow testing can be used when in-office spirometry is not available.  
3. Some laboratories still use older bronchodilator response thresholds (≥12% and ≥200 mL improvement in FEV₁).  
8. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing may have a role as adjunctive testing or when spirometry cannot be performed.

#### ✅ True Statements  
1. Common asthma symptoms include **cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea**, often intermittent and triggered by allergens, infections, dust, fumes, or exercise.  
2. **Asthma symptoms** often worsen in the **evening and early morning** and are commonly triggered by **viral respiratory infections**.  
3. **Symptom variability** (improvement and worsening over time) is a key diagnostic feature of asthma.  
4. History should assess **smoking, pets, and environmental exposures** known to cause bronchial hyperreactivity.  
5. **Nasal polyps, aspirin sensitivity, and wheezing** constitute the "asthmatic triad."  
6. Physical exam in asthma may show **wheezing, reduced airflow, or prolonged expiration**, but findings may be normal when patients are asymptomatic.  
7. Reversible airflow obstruction is confirmed by **spirometry (FEV₁, FVC, FEV₁/FVC ratio)** or **serial peak flow testing**.  
8. **Bronchodilator response** is significant if **postbronchodilator FEV₁ or FVC increases >10% predicted** (2021 ATS/ERS standard); older thresholds are **≥12% and ≥200 mL**.  
9. If spirometry is normal, **bronchial challenge testing** with methacholine, exercise, or mannitol is indicated.  
10. A **negative bronchial challenge test** makes asthma unlikely, while a positive test indicates bronchial hyperreactivity that requires clinical correlation.  
11. **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) testing** is conditionally recommended as an adjunct in asthma evaluation for patients ≥5 years old.  
12. FeNO may be helpful when spirometry cannot be performed, diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide treatment decisions in persistent allergic asthma.  
13. **Chest radiography** is useful to rule out alternative diagnoses such as **COPD, heart failure, parenchymal lung disease, central airway obstruction, and bronchiectasis**.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)  
1. Environmental triggers include allergens, dust, fumes, and exercise.  
5. The "asthmatic triad" is also called **Samter’s triad**.  
11. FeNO testing is suggested by the American Thoracic Society but is not a substitute for standard evaluation.
