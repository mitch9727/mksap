### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Restrictive Lung Disease Diagnosis with Pulmonary Function Testing

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A spirometry pattern in which the **forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)** and/or the **forced vital capacity (FVC)** is reduced but the **FEV1/FVC ratio is 0.70 or greater** suggests **restrictive lung disease**.
2. Documentation of **low lung volumes** is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of **restrictive lung disease**.
3. **Total lung capacity (TLC) less than 80% of predicted** indicates a **restrictive pattern**.
4. The **diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco)** is typically measured in patients with potential restrictive lung disease.
5. **Dlco** is a significant predictor of prognosis in diseases such as **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**.
6. **Dlco** can be low in both **obstructive lung disease** and **restrictive lung disease**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Unlike in obstructive disease, which can be diagnosed by FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio, restrictive disease requires **measurement of lung volumes**.
2. The **6-minute walk test** assesses response to therapy in interstitial lung disease but does **not** differentiate among causes of lung disease.
3. **Transthoracic echocardiography** is appropriate to assess for cardiac causes (valvular disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension), but it is not the best next test when spirometry suggests restriction.
4. **Tiotropium** and other long-acting muscarinic antagonist bronchodilators are used for **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, not restrictive lung disease.

#### ✅ True Statements — Lung Volumes and Dlco
1. **Lung volumes** can be measured by **body plethysmography** or **nitrogen diffusion**.
2. Measures of **lung volumes** include **total lung capacity**, **vital capacity**, **functional residual capacity**, **expiratory reserve volume**, and **residual volume**.
3. **Dlco measurement** estimates the amount of **gas transfer through the alveolar-capillary unit** and is proportional to the **surface area of functional lung**.
4. **Dlco** is measured by inhalation of a gas mixture containing **carbon monoxide** and **helium**.
5. The **Dlco value** is corrected for **hemoglobin level**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Measuring lung volumes confirms or excludes **restriction** in patients with abnormal spirometry.
3. A reduced **Dlco** often indicates **parenchymal lung disease** or **pulmonary vascular disease**.
