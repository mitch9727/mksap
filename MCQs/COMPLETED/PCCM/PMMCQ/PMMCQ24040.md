### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of cough-variant asthma

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cough-variant asthma** should be suspected in patients with a chronic cough who do not respond to empiric therapy for **upper airway cough syndrome** and have no clinical findings that suggest an alternate cause.
2. The diagnosis of **cough-variant asthma** often requires documentation of **bronchial hyperreactivity** by **methacholine challenge testing**, because most patients will have normal results on baseline spirometry.
3. Common causes of a chronic cough include **upper airway cough syndrome**, **gastroesophageal reflux disease**, **asthma**, **smoking**, and **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor** use.
4. **Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis** is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic cough.
5. Empiric treatment for **upper airway cough syndrome** is a reasonable first step in management.
6. Patients with cough-variant asthma often have a **chronic nocturnal cough** without clinical findings suggestive of an alternate cause such as gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7. Most patients with cough-variant asthma have **normal baseline spirometry** without an increase in **FEV₁** or **FVC** after the use of a bronchodilator.
8. Before prescribing **inhaled budesonide–formoterol therapy**, the diagnosis of asthma must be confirmed by demonstrating reversible airflow obstruction on spirometry or bronchial hyperreactivity with a positive methacholine challenge test.
9. Empiric **proton pump inhibitor** therapy for possible gastroesophageal reflux disease may be considered in chronic cough without a clear cause that does not appear secondary to upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.
10. **Upper endoscopy** is rarely indicated in the evaluation of a chronic cough in the absence of clinical findings that suggest gastrointestinal disease.
11. Even when gastroesophageal reflux disease is suspected as the cause of a chronic cough, most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease have normal findings on upper endoscopy.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Chronic cough with a nocturnal pattern and no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease is especially suggestive of cough-variant asthma.
5. Patients who do not respond to empiric therapy for upper airway cough syndrome should undergo evaluation for cough-variant asthma.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Patients with asthma whose primary symptom is **chronic cough without other symptoms** are considered to have **cough-variant asthma**.
2. Diagnosis of cough-variant asthma often requires documentation of **bronchial hyperreactivity with a methacholine challenge test**, because most patients will have normal baseline spirometry.
3. Recommended therapies for cough-variant asthma are the same as those for other types of asthma.
4. Other causes of chronic cough that should be investigated include **gastroesophageal reflux disease** and **upper airway cough syndrome** resulting from rhinitis.
5. Chronic cough causes frequently coexist and may require **concomitant therapy**.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease and upper airway cough syndrome may overlap with cough-variant asthma and complicate evaluation.
