# 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Step-Up Therapy in Persistent Asthma

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) 2020 guidelines** recommend that adults with **moderate persistent asthma** use a **single combined glucocorticoid-formoterol inhaler daily with additional doses as needed** (maintenance and reliever therapy, MART).  
2. For step-up therapy in **poorly controlled asthma**, use **medium- to high-dose combined inhaled glucocorticoid–long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)** plus a **long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)** and **short-acting β2-agonist as needed**, if no contraindications exist.  
3. In patients with **persistent asthma poorly controlled on medium-dose budesonide-formoterol**, the next step is to **increase to high-dose budesonide-formoterol**.  
4. **Anti–interleukin-5 therapy** (e.g., **mepolizumab**) can be considered for patients with **absolute eosinophil count >150/µL (0.15 × 10⁹/L)** but is not indicated for patients with lower counts.  
5. **Anti-IgE therapy** (e.g., **omalizumab**) is considered in patients with **perennial allergen sensitivity** and **IgE 30–700 U/mL**, but only after failure of **high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy**.  
6. **LAMAs (e.g., tiotropium)** can improve lung function and reduce exacerbations in asthma uncontrolled on **glucocorticoid–LABA therapy**, but they should be **avoided in patients at risk for urinary retention**.  

#### 💬 Extra
1. MART improves adherence and reduces exacerbations compared to separate maintenance + rescue inhalers.  
4. This patient’s eosinophil count of 120/µL does not meet the threshold for IL-5 biologics.  
6. Urinary retention risk is important in patients with **benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**.

#### ✅ True Statements — Controller Medications for Asthma
1. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** are the most effective class of **controller medications** in asthma.  
2. **Active smoking** reduces the effectiveness of inhaled glucocorticoids and may require higher doses.  
3. **Adverse effects of inhaled glucocorticoids** include **oral candidiasis, dysphonia**, and, at higher doses, **systemic effects** such as **adrenocortical suppression, reduced bone mineral density, cataracts, and increased pneumonia risk**.  
4. **LABAs** improve control and reduce exacerbations when combined with inhaled glucocorticoids, but **should not be used alone** because of increased risk of asthma-related death.  
5. **LABAs plus inhaled glucocorticoids in a single inhaler** improve adherence and reduce cost compared with separate inhalers.  
6. **Leukotriene receptor antagonists** have modest bronchodilation effects and are effective in **aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease**.  
7. **Oral glucocorticoids** should be reserved for acute exacerbations and **avoided long term** due to adverse effects.  
8. **LAMAs (e.g., tiotropium)** improve lung function and reduce exacerbations when added to inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy.  
9. **Biologic therapies** (anti-IgE, anti-IL-5, anti-IL-4/IL-13, anti-TSLP) are used in **severe asthma not adequately controlled on standard therapy**.  
10. **Omalizumab** reduces exacerbations and emergency visits in patients with **moderate to severe atopic asthma** not controlled with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy.  
11. **IL-5 inhibitors (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab)** and **IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor (dupilumab)** benefit patients with **eosinophilia** (threshold 150–400/µL depending on agent).  
12. **Tezepelumab**, an anti-TSLP biologic, is approved for **severe asthma regardless of phenotype**.  
13. Before biologics, clinicians must verify **adherence**, assess **inhaler technique**, and address **comorbidities**.  

#### 💬 Extra
3. Systemic effects are uncommon below **400 µg/day budesonide equivalent**.  
4. LABAs are safe when combined with inhaled glucocorticoids (as confirmed in large trials).  
12. Tezepelumab has a broader indication than other biologics because it is not limited to eosinophilic or allergic asthma phenotypes.
