### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of tracheal stenosis using spirometry

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **flow-volume loop** showing flattening of both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs suggests a **fixed airway obstruction**, such as tumor or tracheal stenosis.
2. **Flow-volume loops** plot air flow against volume during maximal inspiration and expiration.
3. Flattened inspiratory and expiratory limbs suggest a fixed airway obstruction.
4. **Tracheal stenosis** occurs in up to 10% of patients following tracheostomy.
5. Tracheal stenosis often presents with **exertional dyspnea**.
6. In **asthma**, spirometry demonstrates a decrease in **forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)** and the **FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio**, with improvement in FEV1 and/or FVC after inhaled bronchodilator administration.
7. The flow-volume loop in asthma typically shows a **concave expiratory limb** rather than a flattened limb.
8. **Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO)** is a transient inappropriate narrowing of the larynx in response to triggers such as asthma, exercise, and stress.
9. Spirometry in ILO may show flattening of the inspiratory loop of the flow-volume curve, but **laryngoscopy is required** for diagnosis.
10. The flow-volume loop in **neuromuscular weakness** is characterized by a narrow flow-volume plot and a reduction in all lung volumes.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Flattened inspiratory and expiratory limbs on a flow-volume loop are inconsistent with asthma, ILO, or neuromuscular weakness.
4. Tracheal stenosis after tracheostomy is associated with exertional dyspnea and characteristic flow-volume loop changes.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Pulmonary function testing interpretation classifies abnormal results as **obstructive**, **restrictive**, or **mixed obstructive/restrictive**, and assesses the severity of impairment.
2. A reduced **FEV1/FVC ratio** is consistent with obstruction.
3. Severity of obstruction is determined according to the measured **FEV1** as a percentage of the predicted value.
4. The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society define a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio as below the **lower limit of normal**, whereas the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease defines a reduced ratio as below **0.70** on a postbronchodilator test.
5. The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society 2021 technical standard defines bronchodilator responsiveness as an increase from baseline in FEV1, FVC, or both of at least **10% relative to the predicted value**.
6. Many laboratories still use the former thresholds (12% and 200 mL) for a significant bronchodilator response.
7. Measurement of **lung volumes** may help in assessing obstructive lung disease but is not necessary for diagnosis.
8. Elevation of **total lung capacity (TLC)** and **residual volume** (120% or greater of predicted) generally indicates **hyperinflation and air trapping**.
9. If FEV1 or FVC is reduced and the FEV1/FVC ratio is **0.70 or greater**, then the pattern may be restrictive, but measurement of TLC is needed to confirm restriction.
10. If TLC is less than 80% of predicted (or below the lower limit of normal), a restrictive pattern is present.
11. Some patients have coexisting restrictive and obstructive disorders, such as **combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema**.
12. **Obesity** often results in reduced lung volumes (FEV1 and FVC) with a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio and modest reductions in TLC and expiratory reserve volume.
13. **Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco)** is reduced in conditions with destruction, infiltration, or removal of alveolar-capillary units, or when their function is compromised.
14. Dlco may be increased in conditions that raise pulmonary capillary blood volume, such as pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, left-to-right shunt, or asthma.
15. The **flow-volume loop** is a graphic representation of maximally forced inspiratory and expiratory flow (Y-axis) against volume (X-axis).
16. The shape of the spirometric flow-volume loop can help differentiate obstructive from restrictive patterns and suggest the anatomic location of airway obstruction.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Obstructive patterns require both reduced FEV1 and reduced FEV1/FVC ratio.
9. Restrictive patterns require confirmation with TLC measurement.
12. Obesity-related spirometry changes may mimic restrictive patterns but typically show preserved FEV1/FVC ratio.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: Characterization of Impairment Severity in Pulmonary Function Tests)
1. An FEV1 of 70–79% of predicted indicates **mild impairment**.
2. An FEV1 of 60–69% of predicted indicates **moderate impairment**.
3. An FEV1 of 50–59% of predicted indicates **moderately severe impairment**.
4. An FEV1 of 35–49% of predicted indicates **severe impairment**.
5. An FEV1 of less than 35% of predicted indicates **very severe impairment**.
