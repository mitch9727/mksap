### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of chronic asthma with inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** are the most effective class of asthma controller medications and should be prescribed in most patients with asthma.
2. A **long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)** such as tiotropium provides sustained airway dilation, improves lung function, and reduces exacerbations when added to inhaled glucocorticoid–long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) therapy in patients with uncontrolled asthma.
3. A **LAMA should be added** to the treatment regimen when high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy inadequately relieves asthma symptoms.
4. **Triple therapy** with inhaled glucocorticoid, LABA, and LAMA is effective in asthma regardless of blood eosinophil count, and it is not necessary to assess for eosinophilia before adding a LAMA.
5. **Leukotriene receptor antagonists** such as montelukast have modest bronchodilation and are most effective in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease; they are not recommended as primary step-up therapy in uncontrolled asthma.
6. **Biologic therapy** is considered when asthma remains difficult to control with maximal medical therapy and is typically directed against type 2 inflammation, targeting eosinophils or IgE pathways.
7. **Omalizumab** is most effective in patients with elevated IgE levels, whereas eosinophil-targeting biologics (e.g., mepolizumab, reslizumab) are most effective in patients with elevated blood eosinophil counts.
8. Evaluation and treatment of **comorbid conditions** such as obstructive sleep apnea are important in all patients with asthma.
9. **Key Point:** The addition of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist in patients with poor asthma control despite high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–long-acting β2-agonist therapy improves symptom control and lung function and reduces the rate of exacerbation.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Tiotropium is the specific LAMA with proven benefit as add-on therapy in uncontrolled asthma.
5. Montelukast is useful as add-on therapy but should not be the first choice when high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy fails.
6. Biologic agents should be considered only after maximal inhaled therapy, including the addition of a LAMA.

#### ✅ True Statements — Controller Medications for Asthma
1. **Inhaled glucocorticoids** are the most effective class of **controller medications** in asthma.  
2. **Active smoking** reduces the effectiveness of inhaled glucocorticoids and may require higher doses.  
3. **Adverse effects of inhaled glucocorticoids** include **oral candidiasis, dysphonia**, and, at higher doses, **systemic effects** such as **adrenocortical suppression, reduced bone mineral density, cataracts, and increased pneumonia risk**.  
4. **LABAs** improve control and reduce exacerbations when combined with inhaled glucocorticoids, but **should not be used alone** because of increased risk of asthma-related death.  
5. **LABAs plus inhaled glucocorticoids in a single inhaler** improve adherence and reduce cost compared with separate inhalers.  
6. **Leukotriene receptor antagonists** have modest bronchodilation effects and are effective in **aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease**.  
7. **Oral glucocorticoids** should be reserved for acute exacerbations and **avoided long term** due to adverse effects.  
8. **LAMAs (e.g., tiotropium)** improve lung function and reduce exacerbations when added to inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy.  
9. **Biologic therapies** (anti-IgE, anti-IL-5, anti-IL-4/IL-13, anti-TSLP) are used in **severe asthma not adequately controlled on standard therapy**.  
10. **Omalizumab** reduces exacerbations and emergency visits in patients with **moderate to severe atopic asthma** not controlled with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy.  
11. **IL-5 inhibitors (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab)** and **IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor (dupilumab)** benefit patients with **eosinophilia** (threshold 150–400/µL depending on agent).  
12. **Tezepelumab**, an anti-TSLP biologic, is approved for **severe asthma regardless of phenotype**.  
13. Before biologics, clinicians must verify **adherence**, assess **inhaler technique**, and address **comorbidities**.  

#### 💬 Extra
3. Systemic effects are uncommon below **400 µg/day budesonide equivalent**.  
4. LABAs are safe when combined with inhaled glucocorticoids (as confirmed in large trials).  
12. Tezepelumab has a broader indication than other biologics because it is not limited to eosinophilic or allergic asthma phenotypes.
