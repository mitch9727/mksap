### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Diagnosis of asthma using spirometry

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The diagnosis of **asthma** requires the demonstration of **reversible airflow obstruction**.
2. Reversible airflow obstruction is usually demonstrated on **spirometry** with measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and the FEV1/FVC ratio before and after administration of a bronchodilator.
3. A FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70 suggests **obstruction**.
4. A bronchodilator response is defined as an increase from baseline in FEV1, FVC, or both of at least 10% relative to the predicted value.
5. Reversible airway obstruction can also be demonstrated by serial measurement of **peak expiratory flow rates**, with improvement after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment.
6. Some patients with **cough-variant asthma** may have normal spirometry findings and require a **methacholine challenge test** to document bronchial hyperreactivity.
7. The **American Thoracic Society** suggests measurement of the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level in all patients with asthma.
8. An elevated FeNO level (>35 parts per billion) indicates a high level of **type 2 inflammation** and helps predict responsiveness to **inhaled glucocorticoid therapy**.
9. Not all patients with asthma have elevated FeNO, and FeNO is not required for diagnosis.
10. Patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap have a history of severe asthma and **irreversible airflow obstruction**.
11. **Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia** is characterized by cough, dyspnea, fever, and malaise over weeks to months, with patchy opacities on chest radiographs and a restrictive pulmonary function pattern.
12. **Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis** often presents with chronic cough and is suggested by sputum eosinophils or an elevated FeNO level but is not associated with airflow obstruction.
13. **Key Point:** Confirmation of reversible airflow obstruction is a cornerstone of asthma diagnosis and can be achieved by measuring FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio on spirometry or with serial measurement of peak expiratory flow rates.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Improvement in spirometry findings after bronchodilator administration is consistent with asthma.
10. Reversible airflow obstruction differentiates asthma from asthma–COPD overlap, which features irreversible obstruction.
11. Clear chest imaging with an obstructive pattern on spirometry argues against cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
12. Low FeNO levels with concurrent evidence of airflow obstruction are not consistent with nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Pulmonary function testing interpretation classifies abnormal results as obstructive, restrictive, or mixed obstructive/restrictive and assesses severity.
2. A reduced FEV1/FVC ratio is consistent with **obstruction**.
3. Severity of obstruction is determined by measured FEV1 as a percentage of predicted value.
4. The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society define reduced FEV1/FVC ratio as below the **lower limit of normal**.
5. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease defines reduced FEV1/FVC ratio as below 0.70 on post-bronchodilator testing.
6. In 2021, the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society updated bronchodilator responsiveness criteria to an increase in FEV1, FVC, or both of at least 10% relative to predicted value.
7. Many laboratories still use the former threshold of 12% and 200 mL for significant bronchodilator response.
8. Measurement of lung volumes may help assess obstructive lung disease but is not necessary for diagnosis.
9. Elevation of total lung capacity and residual volume (≥120% of predicted) indicates hyperinflation and air trapping, common in severe COPD.
10. If FEV1 or FVC is reduced and FEV1/FVC ratio ≥0.70, the pattern may suggest **restriction**, but total lung capacity measurement is needed for confirmation.
11. Restriction is present if total lung capacity is less than 80% of predicted (or below the lower limit of normal).
12. Patients may present with coexisting restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disorders, such as combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.
13. Obesity can cause reduced FEV1 and FVC with a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio and modest reduction in total lung capacity and expiratory reserve volume.
14. Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is reduced when alveolar-capillary units are destroyed, infiltrated, removed, or impaired.
15. Dlco is elevated in conditions that increase pulmonary capillary blood volume, such as pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, left-to-right shunt, or asthma.
16. The spirometric flow-volume loop graphically represents maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow versus volume and helps differentiate obstructive from restrictive patterns and suggest airway obstruction location.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
6. The 2021 American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society bronchodilator response criteria have not been universally implemented.
13. Obesity alters respiratory physiology and function, often causing reduced lung volumes.
