### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Asthma Exacerbation Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All patients with **asthma** are at risk for **acute exacerbations**, which can range in severity from mild to life-threatening.  
2. **Mild to moderate asthma exacerbations** are characterized by **dyspnea**, speaking in **three- to four-word sentences without agitation**, **use of accessory muscles**, or **significant respiratory distress**.  
3. Additional findings in **mild to moderate asthma exacerbations** may include **tachypnea up to 30 breaths/min**, **tachycardia up to 120 beats/min**, and **mild hypoxemia with oxygen saturation 90%–95%**.  
4. **More significant respiratory distress**, more severe **tachypnea**, **tachycardia**, or **hypoxemia** indicate a **severe asthma exacerbation**.  
5. Treatment of **mild to moderate asthma exacerbations** includes **serial use of a short-acting β₂-agonist (SABA)**, **supplemental oxygen with a target saturation of 93%–95%**, and **oral glucocorticoids**.  
6. **Systemic glucocorticoids** are indicated for **all acute asthma exacerbations**.  
7. **Oral glucocorticoids** are as effective as **intravenous glucocorticoids** for treating asthma exacerbations; intravenous administration is not required.  
8. **Empiric antibiotics** are generally not indicated in asthma exacerbations unless there is a specific suspicion of **bacterial infection**.  
9. **Azithromycin** has been studied in acute asthma exacerbations and found to have **no benefit**.  
10. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations**, empiric antibiotics may be beneficial, unlike in asthma.  
11. **Long-term asthma management** often requires a **step-up in controller therapy after an exacerbation**, such as increasing **inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** dose.  
12. In the acute setting, **systemic glucocorticoids** are required; high-dose **inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** alone is insufficient.  
13. **Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)**, such as **tiotropium**, have **no role in acute asthma exacerbation management**.  
14. A **short-acting muscarinic antagonist**, such as **ipratropium**, can be used as a **supplementary bronchodilator** in **severe asthma exacerbations**.  

#### 💬 Extra
2. Three- to four-word speech, use of accessory muscles, and dyspnea are clinical indicators of moderate asthma exacerbation.  
3. Mild hypoxemia is defined here as oxygen saturation between 90% and 95%.  
7. Oral therapy is preferred in most cases due to equal efficacy and ease of administration.  
9. Azithromycin differs in utility compared with COPD, where antibiotics are often beneficial.  
11. Controller step-up is part of long-term management, not acute treatment.  
14. Ipratropium is adjunctive in severe asthma attacks but not first-line for mild to moderate exacerbations.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. An **asthma exacerbation** is defined as an **acute worsening of symptoms or lung function from baseline** that requires a **step-up in therapy**.  
2. **Prompt recognition and treatment** of asthma exacerbations are required to **relieve symptoms** and **prevent hospitalizations**.  
3. All patients with **asthma** should have a **written asthma management plan** to help recognize symptoms of an exacerbation and begin **self-treatment**.  
4. **Self-treatment** of asthma exacerbations consists of **frequent use of reliever medications**, **increasing controller medication dose or frequency**, and **adding a short course of oral glucocorticoids** (typically **prednisone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days**).  
5. Patients who do not improve with **self-treatment** or who have **signs of a severe asthma exacerbation** should be evaluated in an **acute care facility**.  
6. **Acute care management** of severe asthma exacerbations includes **close monitoring**, **frequent inhaled SABA administration**, **prompt glucocorticoid therapy**, and **supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%**.  
7. Clinicians should **screen for patient factors associated with increased risk of death from asthma** and provide **appropriate counseling**.  

#### 💬 Extra
3. Written management plans support early intervention and reduce hospitalization risk.  
4. Prednisone short course is standardized as 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days.  
7. Risk factors for asthma-related death are listed in reference tables and should be assessed routinely.
