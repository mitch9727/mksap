### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of Severe Asthma with Tezepelumab

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Severe asthma** is characterized by frequent exacerbations that may require emergency department visits or hospitalizations.
2. Treatment of severe asthma includes **high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol combination therapy**, **long-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists**, and sometimes long-term oral glucocorticoid treatment.
3. Newer therapies for severe asthma include **biologic agents** directed against **IgE** (e.g., omalizumab) and **interleukins** (e.g., mepolizumab, reslizumab).
4. Choice among biologic therapies is guided by the **asthma phenotype**, determined by clinical characteristics and biomarkers such as IgE levels and blood eosinophil counts.
5. **Tezepelumab** is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks **thymic stromal lymphopoietin**, an epithelial cytokine.
6. Unlike other biologic treatments, **tezepelumab use is not limited to a specific asthma phenotype** and it improves asthma control and reduces exacerbations regardless of phenotype.
7. **Macrolide antibiotics** (e.g., azithromycin) do not have a role in the long-term treatment of asthma.
8. **Dupilumab** is most effective in patients with an absolute eosinophil count greater than 150/μL (0.15 × 10^9/L) and an elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level.
9. **Omalizumab** is indicated for severe asthma with elevated IgE levels and sensitivity to multiple allergens.
10. **Key Point:** Patients with severe asthma that remains difficult to control despite optimal therapy should be considered for biologic therapy; **tezepelumab is unique among biologics because its use is not limited to a specific asthma phenotype**.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Long-term oral glucocorticoid treatment is used only when necessary due to side effects.
4. Phenotyping combines clinical features and biomarkers to determine biologic eligibility.
8. This patient’s low eosinophil count and low FeNO level make dupilumab a suboptimal choice.
9. This patient lacks elevated IgE or allergies, making omalizumab inappropriate.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The goals of longitudinal asthma management are to control chronic asthma symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and minimize risk for persistent airway obstruction.
2. Asthma management follows a **stepwise approach** involving assessment of severity, symptom control, and therapy modification.
3. The **2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)** and **2024 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)** guidelines provide stepwise approaches to asthma management, with GINA emphasizing inhaled glucocorticoid–long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) combinations even for rescue therapy.
4. Well-controlled asthma is defined by **daytime symptoms fewer than twice weekly** and **nighttime symptoms fewer than twice monthly** in the prior 4 weeks.
5. Comorbidities such as **gastroesophageal reflux disease**, **sinus disease**, **obstructive sleep apnea**, **vocal cord dysfunction/inducible laryngeal obstruction**, and **obesity** are common in asthma and should be actively managed.
6. All patients with asthma require **quick-relief medication**; inhaled glucocorticoids are the most effective controller medications.
7. Short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs) have rapid onset of action and relieve acute symptoms but are not recommended as sole agents.
8. GINA recommends **inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** for rescue therapy; NAEPP continues to recommend as-needed SABA.
9. Inhaled glucocorticoids reduce airway inflammation, mucosal edema, and mucus hypersecretion but can cause local and systemic side effects depending on dose.
10. Long-acting β2-agonists improve control when added to inhaled glucocorticoids but must not be used as monotherapy due to risk of asthma-related death.
11. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium, improve lung function and reduce exacerbations when added to inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy.
12. Biologic therapies for severe asthma target type 2 inflammation, including IgE and interleukin pathways; **tezepelumab is the newest biologic with broad indications not limited by phenotype**.
13. **Nonpharmacologic asthma management** includes allergen avoidance, reduced tobacco smoke exposure, healthy diet, exercise, and in select cases, bronchial thermoplasty.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Therapy adjustment includes both step-up and step-down approaches depending on control and side effects.
7. Albuterol is the most commonly used SABA in the United States.
9. Local side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids include oral candidiasis and dysphonia.
13. Bronchial thermoplasty is considered for patients with FEV1 >60% predicted and severe, poorly controlled asthma despite high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: *GINA Guidelines for Starting Treatment in Adults and Adolescents with a Diagnosis of Asthma*)
1. In **Track 1 (preferred)**, the reliever at all steps is **as-needed low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol**.
2. In **Track 1**, controller therapy progresses from **as-needed low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** (Steps 1–2) to **low-dose** (Step 3) then **medium-dose maintenance inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** (Step 4).
3. At **Track 1 Step 5**, add a **long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)**, assess phenotype, and consider **high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–formoterol** with or without biologics (**anti-IgE, anti–IL-5/5R, anti–IL-4Rα, anti-TSLP**).
4. In **Track 2 (alternative)**, **Step 1** uses **inhaled glucocorticoid whenever short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) is taken**.
5. In **Track 2**, controller therapy advances to **low-dose maintenance inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA** at Step 3 and **medium/high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA** at Step 4.
6. In **Track 2 Step 5**, add **LAMA**, assess phenotype, and consider **high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA** with or without biologics (**anti-IgE, anti–IL-5/5R, anti–IL-4Rα, anti-TSLP**).
7. In **Track 2**, the reliever is **as-needed inhaled glucocorticoid–SABA or as-needed SABA**.
