### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of type 2 asthmatic airway inflammation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Approximately half of patients with asthma have **type 2 airway inflammation** and may benefit from biologic therapy.
2. Asthma phenotyping helps determine the appropriate biologic therapy in patients with difficult-to-control asthma; phenotype elements include clinical characteristics such as atopy and nasal polyposis and biomarkers such as IgE levels and eosinophil counts.
3. **Dupilumab** is an interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 inhibitor indicated for moderate to severe asthma and an absolute eosinophil count greater than 150/µL (0.15 × 10⁹/L) or a dependence on systemic glucocorticoids.
4. Dupilumab improves upper and lower airway symptoms in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and asthma, which commonly coexist and increase overall symptom burden.
5. Additional indications for dupilumab include atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and chronic sinus disease.
6. **Omalizumab** is indicated in patients with severe persistent asthma who have elevated IgE levels and sensitivity to multiple allergens and may be especially beneficial in patients with a history of childhood-onset asthma.
7. Oral glucocorticoids are indicated for acute asthma exacerbations but should be avoided as long-term treatment due to adverse effects.
8. **Roflumilast** decreases the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic bronchitis subtype but has no role in the treatment of asthma.
9. Key Point: Dupilumab is an interleukin-4 inhibitor indicated for moderate to severe asthma and an absolute eosinophil count greater than 150/µL (0.15 × 10⁹/L) or a dependence on systemic glucocorticoids.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Clinical characteristics of an asthma phenotype include atopy and nasal polyposis.
6. Omalizumab is also indicated for patients with nasal polyps.
7. Oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone should be initiated promptly in acute exacerbations.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Controller medications for asthma provide ongoing symptom relief and prevent exacerbations.
2. Inhaled glucocorticoids are the most effective class of asthma controller medications and alleviate airway mucosal edema, mucus hypersecretion, and airway inflammation.
3. In active smokers, inhaled glucocorticoids are less effective, and higher doses may be required.
4. Local adverse effects of inhaled glucocorticoids include oral candidiasis and dysphonia.
5. Systemic adverse effects of inhaled glucocorticoids, such as adrenocortical suppression, reduced bone mineral density, and cataracts, generally do not occur at dosages below 400 μg/day of budesonide or equivalent.
6. High-dose and high-potency inhaled glucocorticoids increase the risk of pneumonia.
7. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) improve asthma control and decrease exacerbations when combined with an inhaled glucocorticoid.
8. Single-agent LABA therapy is not recommended because it increases asthma-related death risk when used without another controller medication.
9. Leukotriene-receptor antagonists have modest bronchodilation effects and are especially effective in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
10. Long-term oral glucocorticoids should be avoided in asthma management due to adverse effects.
11. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium, improve lung function and reduce exacerbations when added to inhaled glucocorticoid plus LABA therapy.
12. Biologic therapies are indicated for patients with severe asthma not controlled on standard therapy, targeting type 2 inflammation pathways involving eosinophils and IgE production.
13. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE biologic that reduces exacerbations and emergency department visits in patients with severe persistent asthma and high IgE levels despite maximal inhaled therapy.
14. Anti–interleukin-5 agents (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) and dupilumab (anti–IL-4 and IL-13) benefit patients with eosinophilic asthma phenotypes.
15. Tezepelumab is a biologic therapy for severe asthma with broad indications not limited to a specific phenotype.
16. Both anti-IgE and anti-IL therapies reduce symptoms, need for oral glucocorticoids, and exacerbations in eligible patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Inhaled glucocorticoids’ effectiveness diminishes in active smokers.
7. LABAs are most effective when administered in a single inhaler with inhaled glucocorticoids for adherence and cost-effectiveness.
11. LAMAs can be substituted for LABAs in patients with excessive adverse effects from LABAs.
