### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Evaluation for α1-Antitrypsin Deficiency in COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is diagnosed in the appropriate clinical context by a **post‑bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC ratio <0.70**.  
2. Most cases of COPD are caused by exposure to **respiratory irritants** such as tobacco smoke.  
3. **α1‑Antitrypsin deficiency** is an important and **treatable** cause of COPD.  
4. Basilar emphysema, associated liver disease, panniculitis, or a strong family history of emphysema may suggest α1‑antitrypsin deficiency, but **none are sufficiently sensitive to exclude the condition without testing**.  
5. **Measuring an α1‑antitrypsin level is recommended in all patients diagnosed with COPD.**  
6. Measurement of **diffusing capacity (Dlco)** may help determine disease severity in COPD but **is not required to diagnose COPD**.  
7. **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)** testing has **no role in the diagnosis of COPD**.  
8. **Polysomnography** is indicated to confirm **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** and is **not indicated** in patients with COPD who lack symptoms of sleep‑disordered breathing.  
9. **Key Point:** An **α1‑antitrypsin level** should be measured **in all patients with COPD** to evaluate for α1‑antitrypsin deficiency.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Spirometry confirmation is required to establish COPD before considering disease modifiers such as α1‑antitrypsin deficiency.  
5. In a patient newly diagnosed with COPD, **α1‑antitrypsin measurement** is the **best next diagnostic step**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. COPD disease assessment entails determining **symptom severity** and **risk of acute exacerbation**.  
2. Validated symptom tools include the **COPD Assessment Test (CAT)**, **Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale**, **St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire**, and the **Clinical COPD Questionnaire**.  
3. The **Clinical COPD Questionnaire** is also often used to **screen** patients for COPD symptoms.  
4. High risk for recurrent acute exacerbations is predicted by **FEV₁ <50% of predicted**, **≥2 exacerbations in the prior year**, or **any hospitalization** for an acute exacerbation.  
5. A formal assessment of COPD severity can be performed using the **GOLD model**, which combines **symptom assessment (CAT or mMRC)** with **exacerbation history**.  
6. The **CAT total score ranges from 0 to 40**, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.  
7. The **degree of airflow obstruction** on spirometry and the **presence of comorbid conditions** are additional markers of disease severity.  
8. **Pulse oximetry at rest and with exertion** should be used to determine the need for **supplemental oxygen**.  
9. **Arterial blood gases** should be measured to assess for **hypercapnia** in patients with a low FEV₁, change in mental status, acute exacerbation, elevated serum bicarbonate, or oxygen saturation **<92%** on pulse oximetry.  
10. An **α1‑antitrypsin level should be obtained once** in all patients with COPD.  
11. A pattern of **basilar emphysema**, **liver disease**, **panniculitis**, or **strong family history** may suggest α1‑antitrypsin deficiency but **cannot rule it out without testing**.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
5. The GOLD model uses **both** symptom burden and exacerbation history to guide treatment categories.  
8. Oxygen assessment begins with **pulse oximetry** before considering arterial blood gases.  
10. **α1‑Antitrypsin testing** is a **one‑time** evaluation in COPD.

#### ✅ True Statements (from Table: COPD Assessment Test (CAT))
1. The CAT includes **eight items** assessing cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence leaving home, sleep, and energy.  
2. Each CAT item is scored **0–5**, with **higher scores reflecting worse symptoms**.  
3. The **total CAT score is 0–40**.  

#### 💬 Optional Extra(s)
3. Higher **total** CAT scores represent greater overall symptom burden.
