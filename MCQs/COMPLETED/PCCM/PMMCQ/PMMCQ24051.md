### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: COPD Bronchodilator Therapy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The most appropriate initial treatment strategy in **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** is determined by **disease severity** and **exacerbation history**.
2. Patients with **COPD in Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) group B** should be treated with **combination inhaled long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) bronchodilator therapy**.
3. Patients with **COPD in GOLD group A** should be treated with a **short- or long-acting bronchodilator** (β2-agonist or muscarinic antagonist).
4. In **GOLD group A COPD**, a **long-acting bronchodilator** is preferred unless symptoms are very mild, in which case a **short-acting agent** may be used as needed.
5. An **as-needed short-acting β2-agonist (SABA)**, such as **albuterol alone**, is **inadequate therapy** for patients with **GOLD group B COPD**.
6. Patients with **COPD in GOLD group E** should be treated with **combination LABA and LAMA therapy** and can be considered for the **addition of an inhaled glucocorticoid**.
7. The combination of a **LABA and an inhaled glucocorticoid** is **not a preferred regimen in COPD**.
8. **Roflumilast** is a selective **phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor** that can be added to bronchodilators in patients with **severe COPD and chronic bronchitis** to **reduce exacerbation frequency**.
9. **Roflumilast** is not indicated in patients with COPD who are **not receiving bronchodilator therapy** and who have **no recent exacerbations**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Example agents include **salmeterol (LABA)** and **tiotropium (LAMA)**.
6. Inhaled glucocorticoids in COPD are mainly reserved for patients with **frequent exacerbations** and **eosinophilic inflammation**.
7. Unlike in asthma, inhaled glucocorticoids are **not used as monotherapy** in COPD.

#### ✅ True Statements — Bronchodilators
1. **Inhaled bronchodilators** for **COPD** include **β2-agonists** and **anticholinergic/antimuscarinic agents**.
2. Both **short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs)** and **short-acting muscarinic antagonists** produce **similar bronchodilation** and can be used as **monotherapy** in COPD.
3. **Dual therapy** with a **short-acting β2-agonist and a short-acting muscarinic antagonist** results in **greater bronchodilation and expiratory airflow** than either alone, which may provide **additional symptom benefit**.
4. If symptoms in COPD are **not controlled with short-acting bronchodilators**, a **long-acting bronchodilator (LABA or LAMA)** should be added.
5. Selection of a **long-acting bronchodilator** in COPD depends on **patient preference, physician preference, potential adverse effects, and cost**.
6. If COPD symptoms persist on **long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy**, addition of a **second long-acting bronchodilator from the alternate class** may improve clinical outcomes.
7. **Long-acting bronchodilators alone** should **not be used in patients with a history or diagnosis of asthma** unless an **inhaled glucocorticoid** is also prescribed.
8. Use of a **LABA without an inhaled glucocorticoid** in patients with **asthma** carries a **potential increased mortality risk**.

#### 💬 Extra
7–8. The mortality risk comes from asthma-specific studies showing adverse outcomes when LABAs were used without inhaled glucocorticoids.
