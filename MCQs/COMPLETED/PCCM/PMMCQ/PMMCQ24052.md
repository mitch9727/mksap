### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Long-Acting Bronchodilator Therapy in COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A **long-acting bronchodilator** is recommended for patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** who have mild disease with frequent symptoms or in whom a short-acting bronchodilator alone has been ineffective.
2. The **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) combined assessment** stratifies patients into categories **A, B, and E** based on **symptom severity** and **history of exacerbations**.
3. **GOLD group A** is defined as **mild symptoms** with **one or fewer exacerbations per year not requiring hospitalization**.
4. Appropriate therapy for **GOLD group A** COPD includes either a **short-acting bronchodilator** or a **long-acting bronchodilator**.
5. In **GOLD group A**, a **long-acting bronchodilator** is generally preferred, although **short-acting bronchodilators** may be sufficient in very mild or infrequent symptoms.
6. **Long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs)** and **long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)** are both appropriate treatment options for patients in **GOLD group A**.
7. **GOLD group B** patients have a greater symptom burden than group A despite both groups having low exacerbation risk.
8. In **GOLD group B**, combination therapy with a **LABA plus a LAMA** is recommended.
9. Patients with **two or more exacerbations** or **one or more exacerbations leading to hospitalization per year** are categorized as **GOLD group E**, regardless of symptom severity.
10. **GOLD group E** patients should receive combination therapy with a **LABA plus a LAMA**.
11. In **GOLD group E**, **triple therapy** with a **LABA, LAMA, and inhaled glucocorticoid** may be considered if the **blood eosinophil count is ≥300/μL**.
12. **Short-acting bronchodilators** such as **albuterol** are appropriate as **rescue inhalers** in COPD and may be sufficient for **very mild disease**.
13. Most patients with **COPD** require **controller therapy** rather than **as-needed short-acting agents alone**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. The GOLD model incorporates both **symptoms** (eg, Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, COPD Assessment Test) and **exacerbation history**.
3. Group A corresponds to **low exacerbation risk** and **low symptom burden**.
7. Both groups A and B are “low risk,” but **group B** has **greater dyspnea or quality-of-life impact**.
11. Blood eosinophils are used as a biomarker to predict **inhaled glucocorticoid response**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Inhaled **bronchodilators** for COPD include **β2-agonists** and **anticholinergics/antimuscarinic agents**, both available as **short-acting** and **long-acting** inhalers.
2. Both **β2-agonists** and **anticholinergics** improve **symptoms** and **expiratory airflow** in COPD.
3. **Short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs)** and **short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs)** result in **similar bronchodilation** and either can be used as **monotherapy**.
4. **Combination therapy** with a **SABA and a SAMA** produces **greater bronchodilation and expiratory airflow** than either agent alone and may lead to **symptom benefit** in select COPD patients.
5. If **short-acting bronchodilators** are insufficient to control symptoms in COPD, a **long-acting bronchodilator** (LABA or LAMA) can be added.
6. The choice of a **long-acting bronchodilator inhaler** should consider **patient preference**, **physician preference**, **adverse effects**, and **cost**.
7. If symptoms persist on **long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy**, adding a **second long-acting bronchodilator** from the **alternate class** may improve symptoms.
8. **Long-acting bronchodilators alone should not be used** in patients with a **history or diagnosis of asthma**, unless combined with an **inhaled glucocorticoid**, because **LABA monotherapy in asthma increases mortality risk**.

#### 💬 Extra
4. Combining SABA + SAMA provides **synergistic bronchodilation** compared to either drug alone.
6. Real-world factors such as **inhaler device usability** and **insurance coverage** influence therapy choice.
8. The **safety restriction** is based on evidence of **increased asthma-related deaths** with LABA monotherapy.
