# 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Triple Inhaler Therapy in Severe COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, treatment is guided by the severity of symptoms and the frequency and severity of exacerbations.  
2. Patients with **≥2 moderate COPD exacerbations** or **≥1 exacerbation requiring hospitalization per year** are categorized as **high risk (GOLD group E)** regardless of symptom severity.  
3. Standard therapy for **GOLD group E COPD** is combination bronchodilator therapy with a **long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)** and a **long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)**.  
4. In patients with **COPD and frequent exacerbations**, adding an **inhaled glucocorticoid (ICS)** to LABA and LAMA therapy reduces symptoms and exacerbations, despite an increased risk of pneumonia.  
5. Patients with **blood eosinophil count >300/µL (0.30 × 10⁹/L)** are most likely to benefit from the addition of an inhaled glucocorticoid.  
6. In **severe COPD with frequent exacerbations and eosinophilia**, the most appropriate next step is **triple therapy** with an **inhaled glucocorticoid + LABA + LAMA**.  
7. **Roflumilast**, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, reduces exacerbations in patients with **severe COPD and chronic bronchitis** who continue to exacerbate with **FEV1 <50% predicted**.  
8. During acute COPD exacerbations, **oral glucocorticoids** decrease treatment failure, hospital length of stay, and risk of early relapse.  
9. A **short course of prednisone (40 mg daily for 5 days)** is usually equivalent in efficacy to longer courses, higher doses, or intravenous glucocorticoid administration.  
10. In patients with **severe COPD and eosinophilia**, continuing dual therapy with LABA and LAMA **without adding an inhaled glucocorticoid** is not appropriate.  
11. In patients with **severe COPD**, **triple inhaler therapy with LABA, LAMA, and inhaled glucocorticoid** may reduce exacerbations and provide additional symptom benefit, especially in patients with **eosinophilia**.

#### 💬 Extra
2. GOLD categorization stratifies risk to guide therapy; group E reflects the highest risk patients.  
4. Although ICS increases pneumonia risk, the net benefit in frequent exacerbators is favorable.  
7. Roflumilast is reserved for chronic bronchitis phenotype and low FEV1.  
9. Evidence supports shorter steroid courses for COPD exacerbations to minimize adverse effects.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Inhaled glucocorticoids are typically used **only in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator** for COPD treatment.  
2. Inhaled glucocorticoids are **not used alone** unless the patient is unable to use long-acting bronchodilators.  
3. Inhaled glucocorticoids **improve lung function**, **reduce symptoms**, and **reduce exacerbations** in **moderate to severe COPD**, despite an increased pneumonia risk.  
4. In **severe COPD**, **triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS)** may reduce exacerbations, improve symptoms, and, when combined into a **single inhaler**, decrease mortality.  
5. Guidelines recommend adding inhaled glucocorticoids to long-acting bronchodilator therapy if the **blood eosinophil count >300/µL (0.30 × 10⁹/L)** or if the patient has **asthmatic features with COPD**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The combination approach reflects synergistic effects of bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory therapy.  
4. Mortality benefit has been demonstrated when triple therapy is delivered in a single inhaler device.

3. **GOLD group B** COPD initial therapy is **LABA + LAMA**.
4. If **LABA + LAMA** is not appropriate in **GOLD group B**, **no evidence** favors **LABA** over **LAMA** monotherapy; the **choice depends on patient-perceived symptom relief**.
