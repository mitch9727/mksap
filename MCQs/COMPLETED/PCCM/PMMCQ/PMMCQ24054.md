### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Pulmonary Rehabilitation in COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** combines **exercise training**, **nutritional support**, **education**, and **social support** for patients with **chronic lung conditions**.
2. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** relieves **symptoms**, improves **quality of life**, and decreases the **frequency of hospitalizations** in patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
3. Referral for **pulmonary rehabilitation** should be considered in all patients in **Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) severity group B or E**.
4. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** is particularly indicated for patients with **COPD** who have had a **recent exacerbation requiring hospitalization**.
5. In patients with **persistent hypercapnia** (**Pco₂ ≥52 mm Hg [6.9 kPa]**) after an acute exacerbation of **COPD**, adding **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV)** to **oxygen therapy** prolongs the time to **readmission** and **death**.
6. **Supplemental oxygen** improves survival and quality of life in patients with **COPD** who have a **resting arterial Po₂ ≤55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa)** or **oxygen saturation ≤88%**.
7. **Supplemental oxygen** is also appropriate with a **resting arterial Po₂ ≤59 mm Hg (7.8 kPa)** or **oxygen saturation ≤89%** if **cor pulmonale** or **erythrocytosis** is present.
8. **Methylxanthines** (aminophylline, theophylline) are **not routinely used** in the treatment of **COPD** because of their **narrow therapeutic window** and better alternatives.
9. **Methylxanthines** should not be used with **roflumilast** due to an **increased risk of toxicity**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. This patient’s **mild hypercapnia** does not meet the threshold (**≥52 mm Hg**) for addition of **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation**.
6–7. Criteria for **long-term oxygen therapy** are based on evidence of survival benefit at specific hypoxemia thresholds.
8. While **theophylline** can improve functional capacity, its risks outweigh its benefits in most cases.

#### ✅ True Statements — Pulmonary Rehabilitation
1. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** is a **comprehensive program** that combines **exercise training**, **nutritional support**, **education**, and **social support** for patients with **chronic lung conditions**.
2. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** relieves **symptoms**, improves **quality of life**, and decreases the **frequency of hospitalizations** in patients with **COPD**.
3. Clinicians should consider adding **pulmonary rehabilitation** to appropriate medical therapy in patients with **COPD** who are in **GOLD severity group B or E**.
4. **Pulmonary rehabilitation** should be considered particularly in patients with **COPD** who were **recently hospitalized after an exacerbation**.

#### 💬 Extra
1–2. These program components are multidisciplinary and extend beyond pharmacologic therapy.
3–4. GOLD **group B** includes patients with more symptoms but low exacerbation risk, while **group E** includes patients with frequent exacerbations.
