### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of hypoxemia in COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Supplemental oxygen** improves quality of life and decreases mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and resting hypoxemia with an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) of 55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa) or less or an oxygen saturation of 88% or less.  
2. Patients with **cor pulmonale** or **erythrocytosis** should be offered supplemental oxygen for a Po2 of 59 mm Hg (7.8 kPa) or less or an oxygen saturation of 89% or less.  
3. Some patients with COPD may not qualify for oxygen at rest but may desaturate during **sleep, exertion, or air travel**; the benefits of oxygen in these situations are less well defined.  
4. **Lung volume reduction surgery** improves quality of life, exercise tolerance, pulmonary function, and survival in patients with upper lobe–predominant emphysema and significant exercise limitations, but it is contraindicated when FEV1 or diffusing capacity is less than 20% of predicted or when disease is non–upper lobe–predominant.  
5. **Endobronchial valve treatment** may be appropriate for some patients with emphysema when surgery is not an option.  
6. Adding nocturnal **noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV)** to oxygen therapy in patients with severe persistent hypercapnia (Pco2 ≥52 mm Hg [6.9 kPa]) after an acute COPD exacerbation prolongs the time to readmission and death.  
7. **Roflumilast**, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD who have symptoms of chronic bronchitis.  
8. **Key Point:** Supplemental oxygen improves quality of life and decreases mortality in patients with COPD and resting hypoxemia with a Po2 of 55 mm Hg or less or an oxygen saturation of 88% or less.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Patients with hypoxemia that meets the defined thresholds should receive supplemental oxygen in addition to smoking cessation.  
4. Patients with FEV1 less than 20% of predicted should not undergo lung volume reduction surgery because of high operative mortality.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Supplemental oxygen improves quality of life and decreases mortality in patients with COPD and resting hypoxemia with an arterial Po2 of 55 mm Hg or less or an oxygen saturation of 88% or less.  
2. Patients with **heart failure**, in addition to those with cor pulmonale or erythrocytosis, should also be offered supplemental oxygen if their Po2 is 59 mm Hg or less or oxygen saturation is 89% or less.  
3. Supplemental oxygen is typically prescribed if oxygen saturation falls below 89% during sleep, exertion, or air travel, although benefits are less defined in these situations.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. The related text expands the criteria to include patients with heart failure in addition to those with cor pulmonale or erythrocytosis.
