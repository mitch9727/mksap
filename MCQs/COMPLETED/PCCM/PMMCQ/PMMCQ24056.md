### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Referral for Lung Volume Reduction Surgery in COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In carefully selected patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, **lung volume reduction surgery** is associated with improved quality of life, exercise tolerance, pulmonary function, and survival.
2. Patients with **severe upper lobe–predominant emphysema** and significant exercise limitations should be considered for lung volume reduction surgery unless the **forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)** or **diffusing capacity** is less than 20% of predicted.
3. **Leukotriene-receptor antagonists** such as montelukast have no role in the treatment of COPD.
4. In **acute exacerbations of COPD**, short courses of **glucocorticoids** such as prednisone decrease the likelihood of treatment failure, length of stay, and time to subsequent exacerbations while improving FEV1 and hypoxemia.
5. **Long-term glucocorticoid therapy** should not be used in COPD because of lack of benefit and substantial adverse effects.
6. In patients with COPD and **resting hypoxemia** (arterial Po₂ ≤55 mm Hg [7.3 kPa] or oxygen saturation ≤88%), **supplemental oxygen** improves quality of life and decreases mortality.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. The **National Emphysema Treatment Trial** demonstrated the benefits of lung volume reduction surgery in patients with upper lobe–predominant emphysema and significant exercise limitations despite pulmonary rehabilitation.
2. Patients with FEV1 or diffusing capacity less than 20% of predicted or with non–upper lobe–predominant disease should not be offered lung volume reduction surgery because of high operative mortality.
6. Supplemental oxygen is not indicated for COPD patients without resting hypoxemia to the defined threshold.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. The National Emphysema Treatment Trial demonstrated improved quality of life, exercise tolerance, pulmonary function, and survival with lung volume reduction surgery in patients with upper lobe–predominant emphysema and significant exercise limitations that persisted after pulmonary rehabilitation.
2. Patients with any of the following should not be offered lung volume reduction surgery because of high operative mortality: FEV1 less than 20% of predicted, diffusing capacity less than 20% of predicted, or non–upper lobe–predominant disease.
3. **Nonsurgical lung volume reduction procedures**, including bronchoscopic placement of endobronchial valves or plugs and thermal ablation of the airway, are being studied for treatment of emphysematous changes in patients with COPD.
4. Early results suggest that patients with severe air trapping and hyperinflation may derive the most benefit from nonsurgical lung volume reduction techniques.
5. Patient selection criteria for endoscopic lung volume reduction techniques are complex and vary according to the specific procedure.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. Endobronchial valve therapy is one nonsurgical option with less restrictive criteria.
