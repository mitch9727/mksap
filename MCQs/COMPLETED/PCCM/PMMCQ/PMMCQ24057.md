### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of chronic hypercapnia in COPD with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV)**, also termed positive-pressure mechanical ventilation, has utility in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for both acute and chronic respiratory failure.
2. In patients with a COPD exacerbation and acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with acidosis, **NPPV improves symptoms and reduces intubation rates, length of hospitalization, and mortality**.
3. In patients with persistent hypercapnia (Pco₂ ≥52 mm Hg [6.9 kPa]) after an acute exacerbation of COPD, adding long-term nocturnal **NPPV delivered at home prolongs the time to readmission and death**.
4. The addition of an inhaled glucocorticoid to long-acting bronchodilators improves lung function and reduces symptoms and exacerbations in patients with **moderate to severe COPD** but is associated with an **increased risk for pneumonia**.
5. Inhaled glucocorticoids are most likely to benefit patients with a **peripheral eosinophil count greater than 300/μL (0.30 × 10⁹/L)**.
6. **Oral glucocorticoids** are recommended for short-duration treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD but **should be avoided long term** due to the risk for significant adverse effects.
7. **Supplemental oxygen** decreases mortality and improves quality of life in patients with COPD and **resting hypoxemia** with an arterial Po₂ ≤55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa) or oxygen saturation ≤88%.
8. **Key Point:** Use of long-term nocturnal NPPV in patients with persistent hypercapnia after an acute exacerbation of COPD prolongs the time to readmission and death.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
4. Inhaled glucocorticoids are unlikely to be beneficial in the absence of peripheral eosinophilia.  
6. Oral glucocorticoids may be continued only for the short course given during an acute COPD exacerbation.  
7. Supplemental oxygen is not indicated if arterial Po₂ and oxygen saturation are above hypoxemic thresholds.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV), also termed noninvasive mechanical ventilation, can be used for **acute and chronic respiratory failure**.  
2. In COPD exacerbation with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis, noninvasive PPV **improves symptoms, reduces intubation rates, shortens hospital stay, and reduces mortality**.  
3. Noninvasive PPV may be beneficial for **palliative care** and for assisting with **discontinuation of mechanical ventilation** in patients with COPD and pneumonia.  
4. Noninvasive PPV does not replace intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients who are **critically ill, comatose, or post–cardiac arrest**.  
5. Adding home noninvasive PPV to oxygen therapy in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (Pco₂ ≥52 mm Hg [6.9 kPa]) after an acute exacerbation of COPD **prolongs the time to readmission and death**.  
6. Noninvasive PPV is generally **well tolerated**, and **improvement of the pH and Pco₂ within 1 to 2 hours predicts success**.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
3. The role of noninvasive PPV in palliative care is supportive rather than disease-modifying.  
4. The presence of critical illness, coma, or cardiac arrest requires invasive ventilation rather than noninvasive PPV.
