### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of Severe COPD with Long-Term Azithromycin

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Long-term macrolide therapy** may reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** and frequent exacerbations, whether they have an emphysematous or chronic bronchitis phenotype.  
2. Macrolide antibiotics have both **anti-inflammatory** and **antimicrobial effects**.  
3. Patients should undergo **ECG screening** before starting azithromycin, and the drug should be avoided if a **baseline prolonged QTc** is present.  
4. The **QTc interval** should be periodically monitored after starting azithromycin therapy.  
5. Other medications that prolong the **QTc interval**, such as respiratory fluoroquinolones, should be avoided when possible during azithromycin therapy.  
6. Risks of long-term macrolide use include **antibiotic resistance** and **hearing loss**, but benefits outweigh risks in qualifying patients.  
7. **Nocturnal noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV)** prolongs time to readmission and death when added to supplemental oxygen in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (**PaCO₂ ≥52 mm Hg [6.9 kPa]**) after an acute COPD exacerbation.  
8. **Lung volume reduction surgery** can improve quality of life, exercise tolerance, pulmonary function, and mortality in carefully selected patients with severe COPD who have **upper lobe–predominant disease**, significant exercise limitation despite pulmonary rehabilitation, and **FEV₁ and Dlco at least 20% of predicted**.  
9. **Roflumilast**, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD (**FEV₁ <50% of predicted**) and symptoms of **chronic bronchitis**.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. Long-term azithromycin is most beneficial in patients with severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, such as three or more exacerbations in 1 year.  
7. NPPV is not indicated for patients without significant chronic hypercapnia.  
8. Lung volume reduction surgery is not appropriate for patients with Dlco less than 20% of predicted.  
9. Roflumilast is unlikely to benefit patients with the emphysematous subtype of COPD without cough or sputum production.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Macrolide antibiotics have **anti-inflammatory** and **antimicrobial effects**.  
2. Long-term macrolide therapy may reduce the frequency of exacerbations when prescribed for patients with severe COPD and frequent exacerbations.  
3. **Mucolytics** and **antitussives** are not routinely used for management of COPD but may provide symptomatic relief in patients with significant sputum production.  
4. **Dupilumab** can be added to long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled glucocorticoids for patients with COPD with **chronic bronchitis** and a **high eosinophil count**.  
5. **Ensifentrine**, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, improves lung function and may decrease exacerbation frequency but has not been shown to improve quality of life, and its role in therapy is unclear.  

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. Long-term macrolide therapy is specifically recommended in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations.  
3. Mucolytics and antitussives are considered optional, supportive measures rather than standard COPD therapy.
