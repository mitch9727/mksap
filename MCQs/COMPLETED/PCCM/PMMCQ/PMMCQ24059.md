# 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Antibiotic Therapy in COPD Exacerbation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Antibiotics**, such as **doxycycline**, should be given for **5 to 7 days** in patients with a **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation** who require **mechanical ventilation** (invasive or noninvasive) or who have an **increase or change in sputum production**.  
2. **Bacterial pathogens** that may cause **COPD exacerbations** include **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, **Haemophilus influenzae**, **Moraxella catarrhalis**, and **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**.  
3. A **2020 systematic review and meta-analysis** showed that in **mild to severe COPD exacerbations**, the combination of **antibiotics and oral glucocorticoids** reduces the risk of **treatment failure**.  
4. **Sputum culture** is **not routinely indicated** in **COPD exacerbations**, as the results rarely affect management.  
5. **Theophylline** is **not beneficial** in the setting of an **acute COPD exacerbation** and is therefore not indicated.  
6. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** reduces **intubation rates**, **length of hospital stay**, and **mortality** in **COPD exacerbations with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis**, but it is **not indicated in the absence of respiratory failure**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The combination of **antibiotics and oral glucocorticoids** improves outcomes in COPD exacerbations by reducing relapse and treatment failure.  
2. **Sputum cultures** are reserved for unusual or severe cases where resistant organisms are suspected.  
3. **Theophylline** has a **narrow therapeutic window** and is reserved for refractory, advanced COPD outside the acute setting.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **goals of therapy** during an **acute COPD exacerbation** are to **relieve acute symptoms** and **prevent future exacerbations**.  
2. **Supplemental oxygen** should be administered to maintain **oxygen saturation between 88% and 92%**.  
3. **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV)** should be used if adequate oxygenation or ventilation cannot be maintained; **intubation and mechanical ventilation** may be required if PPV fails or is not tolerated.  
4. **Short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs)**, with or without **anticholinergic agents**, should be used to relieve acute symptoms of a **COPD exacerbation**.  
5. **Oral glucocorticoids** during a COPD exacerbation decrease **treatment failure**, **length of stay**, and **risk of early relapse**, while improving **FEV1** and **hypoxemia**.  
6. **Short courses of oral prednisone** (e.g., **40 mg daily for 5 days**) are equivalent in efficacy to longer or higher-dose regimens, including intravenous glucocorticoids.  
7. **Antibiotics** should be prescribed for **5 to 7 days** in patients with a **COPD exacerbation** who require **mechanical ventilation** or who have **dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence** (or two of these three symptoms if purulence is present).  
8. **Smoking cessation** during or after an exacerbation reduces the risk of future COPD exacerbations.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Targeting oxygen saturation of **88–92%** prevents both hypoxemia and worsening hypercapnia.  
5. Early initiation of **glucocorticoids** reduces hospital admissions in COPD exacerbations.  
6. Evidence supports shorter, lower-dose regimens to minimize adverse effects of steroids.  
7. The “three symptoms” (dyspnea, increased sputum volume, sputum purulence) correspond to the **Anthonisen criteria** for antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations.
