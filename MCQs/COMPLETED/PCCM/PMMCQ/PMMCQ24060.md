### 🫁 Pulmonary Medicine: Lung Transplantation in Severe COPD

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Lung transplantation** in appropriately selected patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** can improve **quality of life** and provides a **median life expectancy of 5.9 years**.
2. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with COPD who have a **high risk of dying within 2 years** and a **high probability of 90-day postoperative survival**.
3. Referral for lung transplantation evaluation in COPD should take into account **life expectancy**, **quality of life**, and **goals of care**.
4. Referral for lung transplantation evaluation in COPD can be considered when the **BODE index (BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) is 5 or 6**.
5. Referral for lung transplantation evaluation in COPD can be considered in the presence of **resting hypoxemia**.
6. Referral for lung transplantation evaluation in COPD can be considered in the presence of **hypercapnia**.
7. Referral for lung transplantation evaluation in COPD can be considered if the **FEV1 is less than 25% of predicted**.
8. Referral for lung transplantation evaluation in COPD can be considered in the presence of **significant exercise limitation** despite **medical therapy**, **smoking cessation**, and **participation in pulmonary rehabilitation**.
9. **Oral glucocorticoids**, such as **prednisone**, should **not** be used for long-term treatment of COPD because of significant adverse effects.
10. In COPD, oral glucocorticoids should be limited to **short courses during acute exacerbations**, when they can improve function, reduce length of stay, and decrease treatment failure.
11. **Lung volume reduction surgery** may improve quality of life, exercise tolerance, and survival in patients with **upper lobe–predominant emphysema** and significant exercise limitation.
12. **Lung volume reduction surgery** is contraindicated in patients with COPD who have **non–upper lobe disease**, **FEV1 less than 20% of predicted**, or **diffusing capacity less than 20% of predicted**, because of high operative mortality.
13. **Roflumilast**, a **selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor**, decreases the frequency of exacerbations in patients with **severe COPD (FEV1 <50% of predicted)** and a **chronic bronchitis phenotype**.
14. Roflumilast is not beneficial in patients with COPD and an **emphysematous subtype**.
