### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Treatment of COPD Exacerbation with Oral Glucocorticoids

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Glucocorticoids** given during acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations decrease the frequency of treatment failures, the length of hospitalization, and the need for hospitalization.  
2. Glucocorticoids improve **forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)** and decrease hypoxemia during acute COPD exacerbations.  
3. If initiated early in the course of a COPD exacerbation, glucocorticoids decrease the need for hospitalization.  
4. Short courses of moderate-dose oral prednisone, such as **40 mg daily for 5 days**, are usually equivalent to longer courses, higher doses, and intravenous administration.  
5. Short courses of oral prednisone are associated with fewer adverse effects compared with longer courses, higher doses, or intravenous regimens.  
6. A 5- to 7-day course of antibiotics is indicated in COPD exacerbations requiring ventilatory support or when there is an increase or change in sputum production.  
7. The goal oxygen saturation in a patient with COPD exacerbation is **88% to 92%**.  
8. **Key Point:** Randomized trials have shown that short courses of oral prednisone (40 mg for 5 days) are usually equivalent to longer courses, higher doses, and intravenous administration.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen can decrease respiratory rate and work of breathing in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but it is not indicated if oxygen saturation is already 88%–92%.  
6. Viral infections are the most common triggers of COPD exacerbations, but bacterial infections can also occur.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The goals of treatment during an acute COPD exacerbation are to relieve acute symptoms and prevent future exacerbations.  
2. Supplemental oxygen should be used to maintain oxygen saturation between **88% and 92%**.  
3. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) may be required if adequate oxygenation or ventilation cannot be maintained.  
4. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required if the patient cannot tolerate noninvasive PPV, has altered mental status, or has worsening hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure despite PPV.  
5. Short-acting β-agonists (SABAs), with or without anticholinergic agents, should be used to relieve acute symptoms of a COPD exacerbation.  
6. Oral glucocorticoids during acute exacerbations decrease the frequency of treatment failure, the length of stay, and the risk of early relapse while improving FEV1 and hypoxemia.  
7. Oral glucocorticoids decrease the need for hospitalization when used early during a COPD exacerbation.  
8. Short courses of oral prednisone (40 mg for 5 days) are usually equivalent to longer courses, higher doses, and intravenous glucocorticoid administration.  
9. Bacterial pathogens that can cause COPD exacerbations include **Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae**.  
10. Antibiotics should be prescribed for **5 to 7 days** in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive), in those with all three of the cardinal symptoms (dyspnea, increased sputum volume, increased sputum purulence), or in those with two of these symptoms when purulence is present.  
11. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis showed that in mild to severe COPD exacerbations, the combination of antibiotics and oral glucocorticoids reduced treatment failure.  
12. Smoking cessation can prevent future COPD exacerbations.
