### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Evaluation of suspected lung cancer with PET/CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **PET/CT** uses the radionuclide fluorodeoxyglucose, which accumulates within highly metabolically active cells such as cancer cells and can be visualized as discrete areas of uptake.
2. **PET/CT** is widely used to evaluate the likelihood of malignancy in lung nodules, to stage lung cancer, and to evaluate for metastatic disease from other nonthoracic malignancies.
3. **PET/CT** often identifies unsuspected mediastinal or metastatic disease in lung cancer, which informs staging and reduces the number of noncurative surgeries performed.
4. In patients with radiographic evidence of advanced-stage disease for whom diagnosis and staging are best accomplished with a single invasive test, **PET/CT** can help determine the best location for biopsy.
5. Factors that favor proceeding directly to surgical resection for a peripheral lung nodule less than 3 cm include a low risk for N2 or N3 disease based on previously performed comprehensive PET/CT.
6. **Sputum cytology** has poor sensitivity for the detection of lung cancer and is infrequently used, although it may have a role in patients who are not candidates for biopsy or other diagnostic testing.
7. **Key Point:** PET/CT is an appropriate test in some patients with potential lung cancer because it can identify unsuspected mediastinal and metastatic disease, thus informing biopsy choice and staging.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. **PET/CT** can help determine the best biopsy site when multiple lesions are present.
5. Lung masses greater than 3 cm are at higher risk for occult metastatic disease, which warrants evaluation for metastatic disease before surgery.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Initial evaluation for possible lung cancer includes history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum chemistries, and CT of the chest.
2. Most lung cancers present at a late stage.
3. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) present with similar symptoms resulting from local tumor effects, metastatic spread, or paraneoplastic syndromes.
4. Common presenting symptoms of lung cancer include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, and hemoptysis.
5. Findings on physical examination such as consolidation, effusion, bone tenderness, or neurologic findings usually indicate advanced disease.
6. CT findings can assist with diagnosis of lung cancer.
7. **PET/CT** can identify unsuspected mediastinal or distant disease, which informs staging biopsy strategy and reduces futile (noncurative) surgery.
8. The mass size and metabolic rate affect the sensitivity of **PET/CT** to detect lung cancer; false-negative results are more likely for cancers smaller than 1 cm and slow-growing cancers such as carcinoid tumors.
9. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires tissue histopathology.
10. In patients with radiographic evidence of advanced-stage disease, diagnosis and staging are best accomplished with a single invasive test that establishes both diagnosis and stage.
11. Mediastinal and central lesions are generally best approached with bronchoscopy, whereas smaller peripheral lesions are best approached with transthoracic needle biopsy.
12. **Sputum cytology** has poor sensitivity in detecting lung cancer and is rarely used.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. The choice of tissue sampling strategy depends on tumor size, tumor location, patient characteristics, and local expertise.
