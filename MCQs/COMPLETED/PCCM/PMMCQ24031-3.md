### 🫁 Pulm/CC: Evaluation of suspected lung cancer with PET/CT

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** uses the radionuclide fluorodeoxyglucose, which accumulates within highly metabolically active cells such as cancer cells and can be visualized as discrete areas of uptake.
2. **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** is widely used to evaluate the likelihood of malignancy in lung nodules, to stage lung cancer, and to evaluate for metastatic disease from other nonthoracic malignancies.
3. **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** often identifies unsuspected mediastinal or metastatic disease in lung cancer, which informs staging and reduces the number of noncurative surgeries performed.
4. In patients with radiographic evidence of advanced-stage disease for whom diagnosis and staging are best accomplished with a single invasive test, **positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** can help determine the best location for biopsy.
5. For a peripheral lung nodule less than 3 cm, factors that favor proceeding directly to surgical resection include a low risk for N2 or N3 disease based on a previously performed comprehensive **positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)**.
6. **Sputum cytology** has poor sensitivity for the detection of lung cancer and is infrequently used, although it may have a role in patients who are not candidates for biopsy or other diagnostic testing.
7. **Key Point:** **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** is an appropriate test in some patients with potential lung cancer because it can identify unsuspected mediastinal and metastatic disease, thus informing biopsy choice and staging.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
2. **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** can help determine the most appropriate biopsy site when multiple lesions are present in patients with suspected lung cancer.
5. Lung masses greater than 3 cm are at higher risk for occult metastatic disease, which warrants additional evaluation for metastatic disease before surgery.

#### ✅ Additional True Statements (from Related Text)
1. Initial evaluation for possible lung cancer should include a complete history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum chemistries, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.
2. Most lung cancers present at a late stage rather than at an early stage.
3. **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** and **small cell lung cancer (SCLC)** present with similar symptoms resulting from local tumor effects, metastatic spread, or paraneoplastic syndromes.
4. The most common presenting symptoms of lung cancer include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, and hemoptysis.
5. Findings on physical examination such as consolidation, pleural effusion, bone tenderness, or neurologic abnormalities usually indicate advanced lung cancer.
6. **Computed tomography (CT)** findings can assist with the diagnosis of lung cancer.
7. **Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** can identify unsuspected mediastinal or distant disease, which informs staging biopsy strategy and reduces futile (noncurative) surgery in patients with lung cancer.
8. The sensitivity of **positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)** to detect lung cancer is affected by mass size and metabolic rate; false-negative results are more likely for cancers smaller than 1 cm and slow-growing cancers such as carcinoid tumors.
9. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires tissue histopathology rather than imaging alone.
10. In patients with radiographic evidence of advanced-stage lung cancer, diagnosis and staging are best accomplished with a single invasive test that establishes both the diagnosis and the disease stage.
11. Mediastinal and central lung lesions are generally best approached with bronchoscopy, whereas smaller peripheral lesions are generally best approached with transthoracic needle biopsy.
12. **Sputum cytology** has poor sensitivity in detecting lung cancer and is rarely used as a diagnostic test.

#### 💬 Extra(s)
1. The choice of tissue sampling strategy for lung cancer depends on tumor size, tumor location, patient characteristics, and local expertise.
