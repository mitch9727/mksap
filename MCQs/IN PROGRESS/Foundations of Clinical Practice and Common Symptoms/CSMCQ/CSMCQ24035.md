### 🦴 Common Symptoms: Lateral Meniscus Tear Diagnosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Meniscal tears** usually result from an **acute twisting knee injury**, but they can also develop **insidiously** due to **chronic degeneration**.

4. A **small or moderate knee effusion** may be present on examination in **meniscal tears**.
5. **Specialized tests of meniscal integrity**, including the **McMurray test**, **medial–lateral grind test**, and **Thessaly test**, are often **positive** in **meniscal tears**, but **no single test is highly sensitive or specific**.
6. A **combination of clinical findings** is **more diagnostically informative** for **meniscal tears** than **any single test**.
7. **Imaging studies** for **suspected meniscal tears** may **not be necessary** and are often **reserved for cases in which surgery is being considered**.
8. **Iliotibial band syndrome** is an **overuse condition** that causes **lateral knee pain** and **does not present suddenly**.
9. In **iliotibial band syndrome**, **tenderness** localizes to the **lateral femoral epicondyle** rather than the **joint line**, and **tests of meniscal integrity are negative**.
10. **Knee osteoarthritis** in **young adults without prior trauma** is **unlikely** and typically presents **insidiously**; **bony joint abnormalities** may be present on examination.
11. **Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** is characterized by **poorly localized anterior knee pain** that **worsens with prolonged sitting**, **squatting**, **running**, and **using stairs**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. Examples of **meniscal integrity tests** include the **McMurray test**, **medial–lateral grind test**, and **Thessaly test** (names provided for clarity).
7. The statement reflects that **imaging** is commonly deferred in **suspected meniscal tears** unless **operative planning** is being pursued.
9. **Localization of tenderness** at the **lateral femoral epicondyle** helps distinguish **iliotibial band syndrome** from **meniscal pathology** at the **joint line**.
10. **Bony changes** on examination are characteristic of **osteoarthritis** and contrast with the **soft‑tissue joint line findings** seen in **meniscal tears**.
11. The **anterior** location of pain in **PFPS** contrasts with **lateral joint line pain** typical of **lateral meniscal pathology**.

##### ✅ True Statements — Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Tears
1. **Acute, traumatic onset of knee pain** with **swelling** should raise concern for **ligamentous and/or meniscal tears**.
2. **Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears** usually involve **noncontact twisting injuries**.
3. In **ACL tears**, patients may report a **popping sound** and often **cannot bear weight immediately**.
4. **Large knee effusions** due to **hemarthrosis** often **develop within 2 hours** after **ACL injury** and may **impede initial examination**.
5. The **anterior drawer test** and **Lachman test** frequently demonstrate **increased ligamentous laxity** in **ACL tears**.
6. The **Lachman test** may be **most useful in the acute setting** for evaluating **ACL integrity**.
7. **Radiography** should be performed to evaluate for possible **tibial avulsion fractures** when **ACL tear** is suspected; **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** is **often performed as well**.
8. **ACL tears** frequently **require surgical reconstruction**, especially in **active patients** or those with an **unstable knee**, whereas a **nonoperative approach** may be appropriate as a **3‑month trial** or in **older and less active patients**.

##### 💬 Extra — ACL
4. **Hemarthrosis** refers to **bleeding into the joint space**, explaining the **rapid effusion** and **limited exam** in early **ACL injury**.
7. **Tibial avulsion fractures** can accompany **ACL injuries**; **radiography** helps detect these **bony injuries** even when **MRI** is planned.
8. A **3‑month nonoperative trial** typically involves **activity modification** and **structured rehabilitation** before deciding on **reconstruction**.

##### ✅ True Statements — Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) and Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) Tears
1. **Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears** involve a **posteriorly directed force** applied to the **proximal anterior tibia** with the **knee flexed**.
2. **Increased PCL laxity** may be detected by the **posterior drawer test** and by **pushing posteriorly** on the **proximal tibia** with the **knee flexed at 90°** (the **opposite motion** of the **anterior drawer test**).
3. **Medial collateral ligament (MCL) tears** typically involve a **lateral blow** to the knee causing **valgus stress**.
4. **Increased MCL laxity** suggesting a tear may be detected by applying a **medially directed force** with the **knee flexed at 30°** (**valgus stress test**).
5. **Most MCL and PCL tears** can be **managed conservatively** with **rest** and **physical therapy**.

##### 💬 Extra — PCL/MCL
2. The **posterior drawer** assesses **posterior tibial translation** relative to the **femur**; increased translation indicates **PCL insufficiency**.
4. The **valgus stress test** isolates the **MCL** best at **30° of knee flexion** by minimizing **capsular** contributions.
5. **Conservative care** typically includes **protected weight-bearing**, **bracing** as needed, and **progressive strengthening**.

##### ✅ True Statements — Meniscal Tears (Additions)
1. **Meniscal tears** may arise from **acute twisting injuries** or **insidiously** from **chronic degeneration**, particularly in **older patients**.
2. **Patients with acute meniscal tears** are **usually able to bear weight immediately** after injury.
3. On examination of **meniscal tears**, **effusions**, if present, are generally **small to moderate** in size.
4. **Initial management** of both **acute and chronic meniscal tears** is **conservative** and consists of **rest**, **ice**, and **strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles**.
5. For **degenerative meniscal tears**, **physical therapy** is **as effective as partial meniscectomy** in **relieving pain** and **improving function**.
6. **Surgery** is usually **reserved** for **younger athletic patients** with **persistent (>4 weeks) mechanical symptoms**, whereas **conservative therapy** is generally offered to **older patients**, individualized by **functional loss** and **quality-of-life impairment**.

##### 💬 Extra — Meniscus
1. **Chronic degeneration** often reflects **age-related** or **overuse**-related **meniscal attrition** rather than a single traumatic event.
5. The statement compares **outcomes** (pain relief and function) between **physical therapy** and **partial meniscectomy** in **degenerative tears**.
6. **Mechanical symptoms** include **locking**, **catching**, and **giving way**, which help select candidates for **arthroscopy** when **persistent** despite **conservative care**.

  <figcaption><strong>Video: Noble Test</strong><br>The Noble test is used to evaluate for IT band syndrome pain. With the patient lying supine and the hip in slight flexion, we place our thumb over the distal IT band just proximal to the lateral femoral condyle, and then, moving the patient's knee from flexion into extension, look for pain under the thumb at the distal IT band.</figcaption>

<figure>
  <video src="Anterior Drawer Test.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Anterior Drawer Test</strong><br>The anterior drawer test evaluates the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). In this test, we place the patient's knee in 90 degrees of flexion and sit on the patient's foot to help stabilize the leg. Then, apply an anterior force on the tibia, looking for increased anterior tibial translation, or lack of a firm endpoint, to indicate an ACL rupture.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <video src="Lachman Test.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Lachman Test</strong><br>This is the Lachman test to look for laxity or rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). With the patient's knee in about 20 to 30 degrees of flexion and slight external rotation, we use one hand to stabilize the distal femur and the other hand to apply an anterior force on the tibia, looking for increased anterior tibial translation, laxity, or a soft endpoint, indicating an ACL rupture. If the examiner's hands are small or the patient's legs are big, we can also do a modified Lachman, where we have the patient's femur stabilized on our leg, and using a posterior force with one hand to help stabilize the femur, we use an anterior force with the other hand, again looking for anterior tibial translation, or lack of a firm endpoint, indicating the ACL rupture.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <video src="Valgus Stress Test.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Valgus Stress Test</strong><br>The valgus stress test is used to evaluate injury of the medial collateral ligament (MCL). With the patient's hip flexed, we stabilize the lower leg and then apply a valgus force with the other hand, first with the knee at 0 degrees and then with the knee flexed to 30 degrees, looking for pain or laxity to indicate an MCL injury.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <video src="Thessaly Test.mp4" controls></video>
  <figcaption><strong>Video: Thessaly Test</strong><br>The Thessaly test is used to evaluate for meniscus injury. In this test, the patient stands on the affected knee in about 20 degrees of flexion. The examiner helps the patient rotate internally and externally to stress the medial and lateral meniscus, looking for pain or mechanical clicking to indicate meniscus injury.</figcaption>
