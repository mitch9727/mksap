### 🫀 Musculoskeletal: Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** is characterized by **anterior knee pain or stiffness** that typically occurs with **prolonged sitting** (“theater sign”), **climbing or descending stairs**, **running**, or **squatting**.
2. **Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** is thought to be caused by **abnormal patellar tracking** with **knee movement**.
3. **Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** most commonly occurs in individuals whose **jobs or activities** place **repetitive stress** on the **knee**.
4. **Pain provoked by squatting** is a **sensitive but nonspecific** clinical feature of **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**.
5. **Tenderness elicited by pressure on the patella** may be present on examination in **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**.
6. **No single physical examination finding** is **definitive** for diagnosing **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**; examination findings can be **suggestive** and help **exclude alternative causes of knee pain**.
7. **Imaging** is **not indicated** in suspected **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** **unless other diagnoses are suspected**.
8. In the **acute phase** of **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**, **activity modification** and **cryotherapy** (ice or **cold‑water immersion**) are **recommended**.
9. In the **recovery phase** of **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**, **physical therapy** focused on strengthening the **quadriceps**, **hamstrings**, and **gluteus muscles** is **recommended**.
10. **Core strengthening exercises** may also provide **benefit** in **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**.
11. **Iliotibial band syndrome** causes **lateral knee pain** and typically shows **tenderness over the lateral femoral condyle** on examination.
12. **Pes anserine pain syndrome (pes anserine bursitis)** causes **medial knee pain** with **tenderness at the pes anserine** (insertion of several **hamstring tendons** on the **proximal medial tibia**); **patellar findings are absent**.
13. **Prepatellar bursitis** causes **anterior knee pain** that is **exacerbated by kneeling** and is typically associated with **swelling anterior to the patella**; symptoms are **not usually worsened by other activity**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The **“theater sign”** refers specifically to **pain with prolonged sitting**, often noted during movies or long rides.
4. “**Sensitive but nonspecific**” indicates that **pain with squatting** is **common in PFPS** but **also occurs in other knee disorders**.
6. Physical examination in suspected **PFPS** assists with **ruling out alternative diagnoses** (for example, **bursitis** or **iliotibial band syndrome**), even though no single finding confirms **PFPS**.
7. In straightforward **PFPS**, **routine imaging** is **unnecessary** and is **reserved** for situations in which an **alternative diagnosis** is **suspected**.
8. **Cryotherapy options** include **ice packs** and **cold‑water immersion**, used alongside **temporary activity reduction**.
9. Lower‑extremity strengthening in **PFPS** targets the **quadriceps**, **hamstrings**, and **gluteal musculature** as part of **structured physical therapy**.
10. **Core exercises** are used as an **adjunct** to lower‑extremity strengthening in **PFPS**.
11. The **lateral femoral condyle** is the typical **tenderness point** in **iliotibial band syndrome**.
12. The **pes anserine** lies on the **proximal medial tibia**, where the **gracilis**, **sartorius**, and **semitendinosus** tendons insert.
13. In **prepatellar bursitis**, **kneeling** is the classic **exacerbating activity**, and a **localized anterior swelling** is characteristic.

#### ✅ True Statements — Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome
1. **Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** is most commonly diagnosed in individuals whose **jobs or sports** impose **repetitive stress on the knee**, such as **runners** and **cyclists**.
2. In **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)**, **patellar mobility** may be assessed by **medial and lateral displacement**, and **abrupt patellar deviation** may be noted during **squatting** or **standing**; the **utility** of these findings is **unclear**.
3. **Nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** may **alleviate symptoms** in the **acute setting** of **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** but have **not shown long‑term benefit**.
4. **Core strengthening exercises** in **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** should be **continued after pain relief**.
5. **Patellar taping** and **foot orthoses** are **commonly used** adjuncts in **patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)** management.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Examples explicitly noted in the text include **running** and **cycling** as **repetitive‑stress activities**.
2. These **examination observations** are **not diagnostic** by themselves and are used as **supportive** findings.
3. The text distinguishes **short‑term symptomatic relief** from **lack of proven long‑term benefit** for **NSAIDs** in **PFPS**.
4. **Core work** complements strengthening of the **quadriceps**, **hamstrings**, and **gluteus muscles** during rehabilitation.
5. These modalities are presented as **commonly used** rather than **definitively proven** therapies in **PFPS**.
