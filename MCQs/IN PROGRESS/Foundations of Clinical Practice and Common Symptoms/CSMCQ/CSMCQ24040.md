### 🫀 Common Symptoms: Evaluation of Neurally Mediated (Vasovagal) Syncope

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Neurally mediated (reflex) syncope** is the **most common form of syncope** and is particularly common in **young adults**.
2. **Vasovagal syncope** is provoked by **noxious stimuli**, **fear**, **stress**, or **heat overexposure**.
3. **Situational syncope** is triggered by **cough**, **micturition**, **defecation**, or **deglutition**.
4. **Carotid sinus hypersensitivity** may be experienced during **head rotation**, **shaving**, or use of a **tight-fitting neck collar**.
5. **Prodromal symptoms** before neurally mediated syncope include **nausea**, **abdominal discomfort**, and **diaphoresis**; **postepisode symptoms** typically include **fatigue**, **nausea**, and **generalized weakness**.
6. The diagnosis of **neurally mediated syncope** can usually be established from the **history** and **physical examination** alone.
7. The **2017 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) syncope guideline** recommends that **all adult patients with syncope** undergo **measurement of orthostatic vital signs** and an **electrocardiogram (ECG)**.
8. **Orthostatic vital signs** and **ECG** are **low-barrier tests** that may suggest an underlying cause of syncope such as **QT interval prolongation** or **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)**.
9. A **cardiac event monitor** may be helpful **after ECG** when **arrhythmia** is suspected as the cause of syncope; the **choice of monitoring modality** depends on the **frequency and nature of events**.
10. **Arrhythmic syncope** most commonly presents **without a prodrome** in individuals with **known cardiovascular disease**.
11. **Tilt-table testing** is **reserved** for **suspected recurrent vasovagal syncope**, **suspected autonomic dysfunction**, or when the **initial evaluation for delayed orthostatic hypotension** is **not diagnostic**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Neurally mediated (reflex) syncope **encompasses vasovagal syncope, situational syncope, and carotid sinus hypersensitivity**, which are listed as subtypes in the same section.
2. **Prodromal symptoms** commonly precede episodes of **vasovagal syncope**, aligning with the classic reflex syncope presentation in this topic.
3. **Situational syncope** is explicitly categorized as a **form of neurally mediated syncope** within the same list of subtypes.
4. **Carotid sinus hypersensitivity** is presented as a **reflex syncope subtype**, with typical **triggering maneuvers** noted alongside it.
5. The **presence of a prodrome** helps distinguish **reflex syncope** from **arrhythmic syncope**, which **often lacks prodrome** (see statement 10).
6. Even when history and examination strongly suggest **neurally mediated syncope**, guidelines still call for **orthostatic vital signs and ECG** in **all adults with syncope**.
7. The **orthostatic vital signs** and **ECG** recommendation is framed as a **low‑barrier, universal first step** in adult syncope evaluation.
9. For suspected **arrhythmic syncope**, monitoring strategies (e.g., **ambulatory/event monitors** or **implantable loop recorders**) are **selected based on event frequency** as described in the same section.
10. **Absence of a prodrome** in the context of **cardiovascular disease** increases suspicion for an **arrhythmic cause** of syncope in contrast to reflex mechanisms.
11. **Tilt‑table testing** is **not routinely indicated** when episodes are **infrequent** and the **initial evaluation is diagnostic**, reflecting its **reserved** role in this guideline summary.

#### ✅ True Statements — Evaluation of Syncope
1. In the evaluation of **syncope**, the **history** and **physical examination** are the **most important diagnostic tools** for determining the underlying cause.
2. The **syncope history** should assess **prodromal or postepisode symptoms**, **comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions**, the **psychosocial context** of the event, and **bystander information**.
3. A **thorough review of prescription and over‑the‑counter medications** should be completed during **syncope** evaluation.
4. The **physical examination** in **syncope** should include an **in‑depth cardiovascular evaluation**, **orthostatic (postural) blood pressure measurements**, and a **basic neurologic examination** to evaluate for **focal deficits**.
5. **Carotid sinus massage** can assess **carotid hypersensitivity** in individuals **older than 40 years** with **syncope of unknown cause**.
6. **Carotid sinus massage** is **contraindicated** in **known carotid disease**, **transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke within the past 3 months**, or a **carotid bruit** (unless previous imaging has **excluded significant carotid stenosis**).
7. An **electrocardiogram (ECG)** in **syncope** evaluation is used to identify **underlying arrhythmia**, **myocardial ischemia**, or **QT interval prolongation**.
8. **Additional studies** generally have a **low diagnostic yield** in **syncope**, but **targeted testing** is appropriate when the **pretest probability** of a specific condition is **moderate to high**.
9. **Echocardiography** is indicated in **syncope** to detect **suspected valvular heart disease**, **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**, or **reduced left ventricular function**.
10. **Exercise stress testing** is indicated for **exercise‑related syncope**.
11. **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**, **event monitors**, or **implantable loop recorders** are used in selected patients with a **probable arrhythmic cause** of **syncope**, with the choice guided by the **frequency and nature of events**.
12. **Targeted laboratory testing** in **syncope** should be **guided by findings** from the **history and physical examination**.
