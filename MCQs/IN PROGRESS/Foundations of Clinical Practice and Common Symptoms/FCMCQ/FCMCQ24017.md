### 🩺 General Internal Medicine: Prevent Harms Associated With Screening for Carotid Stenosis

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **against screening** for **asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis** in adults.
2. Treatment of **asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis** provides **little to no benefit** in **stroke prevention** and may **cause harm** because **carotid endarterectomy** and **carotid artery stenting** can be associated with **stroke or death**.
3. For **asymptomatic adults**, **no additional testing** for **carotid artery stenosis** is warranted.
4. For **symptoms of carotid artery stenosis**, recommended diagnostic tests include **duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries** or **computed tomography (CT) angiography**.
5. **CT of the neck without angiography** is **not indicated** for evaluating the **carotid arteries**.
6. **Duplex ultrasonography** has **reasonable sensitivity and specificity** for detecting **clinically relevant carotid artery stenosis**, but because **prevalence is low** in the general population, **screening** asymptomatic adults yields **many false-positive results** and is **not recommended**.
7. **Auscultation of the neck for carotid bruits** has **poor accuracy** for detecting **clinically relevant carotid artery stenosis** and is **not recommended** as a **routine screening test**; such findings may **lead to harm** by **overdiagnosis** and **unnecessary testing** in asymptomatic adults.

#### 🧪 Screening for Coronary and Carotid Disease

##### ✅ True Statements
1. The **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)** recommends **against screening** for **coronary artery disease (CAD)** with **resting electrocardiogram (ECG)** or **exercise ECG** in **asymptomatic low-risk adults** (**grade D**).
2. In **asymptomatic adults** at **intermediate or high cardiovascular risk**, evidence is **insufficient** to assess the **benefits and harms** of **screening for CAD** (**I statement**).
3. The **American College of Physicians (ACP)** recommends **against screening** **low-risk and asymptomatic adults** with **resting ECG** or **stress testing**.
4. **No specialty organization** recommends **screening low-risk and asymptomatic adults** with **coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring** or **coronary angiography**.
5. The **prevalence of carotid artery stenosis** in the **general adult population** is **0.5% to 1.0%**.
6. **Screening** for **carotid stenosis** in **asymptomatic patients** can **lead to harm** due to **complications** from **angiographic studies** or **endarterectomy**.

#### 📊 Cardiovascular Risk Assessment & Calculators

##### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cardiovascular risk assessment** in **asymptomatic adults** estimates **future cardiovascular event risk** and **does not identify preexisting disease**; **risk assessment** is **distinct from screening**.
2. Validated **risk prediction tools**, such as the **Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE)**, can identify persons at risk for **cardiovascular disease (CVD)** who would benefit from **preventive measures**, including **statin therapy**.
3. The **PCE** is the **single most robust tool** for estimating **10-year risk** in **U.S. adults aged 40 to 75 years** and is **recommended** by the **USPSTF** and other organizations to assess **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)** risk.
4. **Cardiovascular risk scores** may be used to assess an **individual’s risk** for **major cardiovascular events** and to identify **preventive interventions**.
5. The **Framingham Risk Score** estimates **10-year risk** of **major coronary heart disease (CHD)** events (**myocardial infarction** or **coronary death**) using **age**, **sex**, **systolic blood pressure**, **total cholesterol**, **high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol**, **smoking status**, and **presence of diabetes**.
6. The **Reynolds Risk Score** is **sex-specific** and includes **family history** and **high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)** level.
7. The **Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Risk Score** uses **coronary artery calcium (CAC) score** together with **traditional risk factors** to calculate risk.
8. In adults with **borderline (5% to <7.5%)** or **intermediate (≥7.5% to <20%)** **10-year ASCVD risk** based on the **PCE**, the **American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)** considers it **reasonable** to **refine individual risk** using **risk-enhancing factors** such as **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**, **hs-CRP**, **ankle-brachial index (ABI)**, and **family history** of **premature coronary artery disease (CAD)**.
9. The **USPSTF** concluded there is **insufficient evidence** to recommend using these **nontraditional risk factors** for **cardiovascular risk calculation**.
10. There are **significant racial and ethnic disparities** in **CVD** prevalence in the **United States**, related to **structural social factors** and **inequitable access to care**, including **preventive measures**.
11. Many **cardiovascular risk calculators**, including the **PCE**, the **Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Risk Calculator**, and the **MESA Risk Score**, include **race** as a variable in estimating risk.
12. The **American Heart Association (AHA) PREVENT (Predicting Risk of CVD Events) equations** are **sex-specific**, **race-free** equations that **estimate short- and long-term risk**, **incorporate kidney function** into routine CVD risk assessment, **allow consideration** of **cardiovascular–kidney–metabolic (CKM)**–focused clinical variables and **social determinants of health (SDOH)** metrics, and **include heart failure** and **ASCVD** in a **total CVD outcome**.
13. **Implementation** of the **PREVENT equations** is **nascent** and is expected to **evolve** to better determine **individualized risk** and define **integration** into **CVD prevention strategies**.

##### 💬 Extra
2. The **Pooled Cohort Equations** were **derived from several diverse community-based cohorts**.
3. The **Pooled Cohort Equations** are **used to identify persons** who would **benefit from statin therapy** as part of preventive care.
8. **Risk-enhancing factors** are applied specifically to **borderline** and **intermediate** **10-year ASCVD risk** groups as defined by the **ACC/AHA**.
9. The **USPSTF** position on **nontraditional risk factors** contrasts with the **ACC/AHA** approach of using **risk-enhancing factors** to refine risk.
12. The **PREVENT** equations were developed in part because **including race** as a predictor in some risk calculators is considered **problematic**.
