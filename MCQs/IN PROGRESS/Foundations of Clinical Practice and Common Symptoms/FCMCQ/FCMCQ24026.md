### 🩺 Foundations of Clinical Practice: Motivational Interviewing (Behavior Change Counseling)

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Motivational interviewing** is predicated on the belief that individuals have within themselves the means to change their behavior.
2. In **motivational interviewing**, the clinician's role is to **partner** with the patient, **accept** and have **compassion** for their situation, and **guide** conversations to help them **evoke their own reasons for change** rather than imposing the clinician's reasons.
3. **Motivational interviewing** uses the **OARS mnemonic**—**Open-ended questions**, **Affirmations**, **Reflections**, and **Summaries**—to guide rather than direct behavior-change conversations.
4. An **initial collaborative and supportive stance** can increase a patient's willingness to accept recommendations when the patient is already aware of their risk; repeating known risk information is less productive.
5. Providing **directives** (for example, recommending a specific activity) **without first eliciting** what the patient has already tried and what they can fit into their day is **less consistent** with motivational interviewing.
6. **Asking open-ended questions** about what the patient thinks about their situation and what they feel they **can and want to do** is **more consistent** with motivational interviewing than immediately recommending pharmacologic therapy.
7. **Pharmacologic therapy** may **delay or prevent the onset of diabetes** in at-risk individuals, but motivational interviewing emphasizes **eliciting the patient’s perspective before making recommendations**.

#### 💬 Extra
5. Exploring **prior attempts** and **daily constraints** helps identify behavior-change options that are feasible for the patient.
6. After eliciting responses, recommendations should be **concordant with the patient’s desires and abilities**.
