### ⚕️ Perioperative Medicine: Preoperative Laboratory Testing

#### ✅ True Statements
1. All **preoperative laboratory testing** should be tailored to the **nature of the surgery**, **known comorbid conditions**, and **findings from the history or physical examination**.
2. **Routine preoperative laboratory panels** are not recommended because they **rarely guide management**.
3. **Hemoglobin testing** is indicated for **orthopedic procedures** associated with **significant blood loss** to screen for **anemia**.
4. If **anemia** is identified before **elective surgery**, the operation should be **delayed** for evaluation and correction of the anemia to improve surgical outcomes.
5. Use of **hydrochlorothiazide** and **lisinopril** justifies **electrolyte** and **creatinine** testing before surgery because these medications may alter those levels.
6. The most useful screening tool for **bleeding complications of surgery** is the **bleeding history**, not **routine coagulation testing**.
7. **Coagulation testing** is not needed before **elective orthopedic surgery** in patients without a history of abnormal bleeding, anticoagulant use, or coagulopathy.
8. **Liver chemistry testing** is not indicated before surgery in patients without a history of liver disease or recent abnormal liver test results.
9. If the patient is **clinically stable** and there are **no medication changes**, tests do not need to be repeated if they were performed within **4 months** of the procedure.
10. **Urinalysis** to screen for **asymptomatic bacteriuria** is not indicated before **elective orthopedic surgery** in the absence of **urinary symptoms**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Tailoring lab testing improves efficiency and avoids unnecessary costs or delays.
2. Overuse of routine labs may lead to incidental findings that do not change management.
3. Examples of such procedures include **total joint replacement**.
4. Identifying and correcting anemia preoperatively is associated with improved surgical outcomes.
5. These medications may cause **electrolyte disturbances** or **renal function changes**, which can influence perioperative risk.
6. A detailed bleeding history includes responses to minor procedures like **dental work**.
7. Indications for coagulation testing include **history of bleeding**, **anticoagulant therapy**, or **coagulopathy risk factors**.
8. An elevated **body mass index (BMI)** may correlate with **metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease**, but normal recent liver tests negate the need for repeat testing.
9. Stability is defined by **no clinical deterioration** and **unchanged medications**.
10. **Urinalysis** may be appropriate if the patient is symptomatic or undergoing a **urologic procedure**.
