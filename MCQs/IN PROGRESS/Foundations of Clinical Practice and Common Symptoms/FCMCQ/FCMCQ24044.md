### ⚕️ General Medicine: Perioperative Anemia Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Anemia** in the setting of a **hip fracture** is common due to the fracture itself and may worsen postoperatively.
2. In the **perioperative setting**, patients should be **monitored for anemia**.
3. For **hospitalized patients** who are anemic and **hemodynamically stable**, the **Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies (AABB)** recommends a **restrictive transfusion strategy**.
4. A **hemoglobin threshold** of **less than 7 g/dL (70 g/L)** is recommended for most hospitalized patients under a restrictive transfusion strategy.
5. A **hemoglobin threshold of 7.5 g/dL (75 g/L)** may be considered for patients undergoing **cardiac surgery**.
6. A **hemoglobin threshold of 8 g/dL (80 g/L)** may be selected for patients undergoing **orthopedic surgery** or who have **underlying cardiovascular disease**.
7. A **more liberal transfusion strategy** has not been shown to improve outcomes such as **mortality**, **cardiovascular outcomes**, or **stroke**.
8. **Ongoing monitoring without transfusion** is appropriate for a hemodynamically stable patient with hemoglobin above the orthopedic surgery transfusion threshold.
9. **Colonoscopy** is not indicated for anemia due to **acute orthopedic injury and surgery**.
10. **Peripheral blood smear** is not indicated when anemia is attributable to **hip fracture and urgent orthopedic surgery**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This refers to anemia resulting from blood loss associated with traumatic fracture and operative intervention.
3. AABB guidelines are designed to minimize unnecessary transfusions while maintaining patient safety.
8. The referenced patient had a **hemoglobin level above 8 g/dL** and showed no signs of hemodynamic instability.
9. Further evaluation such as colonoscopy would be appropriate only if anemia persists after surgical recovery.
10. Peripheral smear is more appropriate for evaluating unexplained or chronic anemia.
