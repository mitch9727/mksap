### 🫀 Foundations of Clinical Practice: Preoperative Obstructive Sleep Apnea Screening

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Preoperative screening** for **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** is important because OSA is associated with **cardiac events**, **pulmonary complications**, and **intensive care unit (ICU) admissions**.
2. The **STOP-BANG questionnaire** is a simple, validated screening tool with a **high negative predictive value** for identifying **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** risk.
3. Patients identified as **moderate risk for OSA** who do not undergo further evaluation before surgery should receive **close monitoring** and may require **perioperative positive airway pressure therapy**.
4. The **Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine** recommends **preoperative sleep medicine evaluation** in patients with **high STOP-BANG scores** plus evidence of **hypoventilation (CO₂ retention)**, **severe or uncontrolled comorbidities**, or **resting hypoxemia** not attributable to other causes.
5. In patients diagnosed with **OSA**, **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** should be initiated **preoperatively** when possible.
6. **Chest radiography** is only indicated preoperatively for patients with **signs or symptoms of pulmonary illness** or **underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease** with **new or unstable symptoms**.
7. **Coagulation studies** are unnecessary in patients **without bleeding disorders** or **anticoagulant use** prior to **elective surgery**.
8. **Exercise stress testing** is not required if **functional capacity exceeds 4 metabolic equivalents (METs)**.
9. **Preoperative stress testing** may be considered in patients undergoing **elevated-risk surgery**, with **poor or unknown functional capacity** and **elevated risk for perioperative events**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **OSA screening** helps reduce the risk of serious postoperative complications.
2. STOP-BANG assesses factors like **Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, BMI, Age, Neck circumference, and Gender**.
3. These patients may need **perioperative CPAP** even if full polysomnography is not done.
4. These findings indicate **more severe disease** and justify **specialist referral** before surgery.
5. Initiating **CPAP** can improve **perioperative respiratory outcomes**.
6. Routine chest x-rays are not useful in **asymptomatic patients**.
7. Unnecessary coagulation testing can lead to **false positives** and **delays**.
8. This patient's reported exercise routine qualifies as **excellent functional capacity**.
9. Guidelines emphasize **individualized risk stratification** for testing decisions.
