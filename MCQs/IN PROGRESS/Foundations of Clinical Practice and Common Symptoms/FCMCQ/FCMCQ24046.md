### 🧠 Neurology: Perioperative Management of Parkinson Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **Parkinson disease** are predisposed to **perioperative delirium**, **hallucinations**, **orthostatic hypotension**, and **complications related to dysphagia**.
2. Patients with **Parkinson disease** should **maintain their normal antiparkinsonian treatment regimen** during the perioperative period.
3. **Adherence to the patient's home medication schedule**, **education of health care providers** on medication timing, and **avoidance of contraindicated drugs** reduce length of hospital stay for patients with Parkinson disease.
4. **Surgery should be scheduled early in the day** to minimize missed doses of antiparkinsonian medications.
5. **Antidopaminergic antiemetics** should be **avoided** in patients with Parkinson disease.
6. **Statins**, such as **atorvastatin**, do **not require discontinuation** before surgery and have **protective cardiovascular effects** perioperatively.
7. **Abrupt discontinuation of carbidopa-levodopa** can result in **Parkinson symptom flares**, **withdrawal symptoms**, and **parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome**.
8. **Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome** is a potentially **life-threatening complication** characterized by **rigidity**, **fever**, **altered mental status**, and **autonomic instability**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These complications increase perioperative morbidity and necessitate careful medication management.
2. Disrupting dopamine levels can worsen both motor and non-motor symptoms in the perioperative setting.
3. These interventions support continuity of care and minimize fluctuations in drug efficacy.
4. Timing is essential because carbidopa-levodopa has a short half-life and missing doses may lead to symptom worsening.
5. These agents, including metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, can worsen motor symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors.
6. Continuing statins perioperatively may lower cardiovascular event risk and mortality.
7. Discontinuation may provoke severe rebound symptoms or a neuroleptic malignant syndrome–like condition.
8. This syndrome can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome and requires urgent intervention.
