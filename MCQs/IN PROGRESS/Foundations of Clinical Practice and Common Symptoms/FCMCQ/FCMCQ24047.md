### 🫠 General Medicine: Preoperative Risk Stratification in Liver Disease

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Chronic liver disease** increases the risk for **perioperative complications**, including infection, encephalopathy, bleeding, fluid retention, and decompensation of kidney or liver function.
2. Patients with chronic liver disease should undergo **preoperative risk stratification** using validated tools such as the **Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score**, **Child-Turcotte-Pugh score**, or **VOCAL-Penn score**.
3. Patients with **compensated liver disease** and a **MELD score less than 8 to 10** are generally able to proceed with elective surgery with optimal medical management.
4. Patients with **MELD scores between 11 and 15** have intermediate perioperative risk and may benefit from **hepatology consultation** for preoperative optimization.
5. Patients with a **MELD score greater than 15** should be considered for **liver transplant evaluation** prior to surgery if appropriate.
6. **Nonselective β-blockers** such as **carvedilol** are indicated for patients with cirrhosis and **esophageal varices** to prevent bleeding.
7. **β-blocker therapy** may also be indicated for patients with a **cardiac indication**, such as previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, or heart failure.
8. **Repeat upper endoscopy** for variceal screening is not indicated within 3 years in patients without prior varices and whose cirrhosis etiology has ceased (e.g., alcohol abstinence).

#### 💬 Extra
1. Risk stratification helps assess and mitigate the perioperative risks associated with cirrhosis.
2. These scores help guide surgical decision-making and specialist referral.
3. Medical management includes monitoring and addressing complications of cirrhosis.
4. Consultation can help reduce morbidity in patients at moderate risk.
5. Surgical outcomes are poor in decompensated cirrhosis, and transplant may be more appropriate.
6. Carvedilol and similar agents lower portal pressures to reduce variceal bleeding risk.
7. Cardiovascular indications for β-blockers are independent of liver disease status.
8. This applies to patients like the one described, who had a normal endoscopy 2 years ago and an AUDIT-C score of 0.
