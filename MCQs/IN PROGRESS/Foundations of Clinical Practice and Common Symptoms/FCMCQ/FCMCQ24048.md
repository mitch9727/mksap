### ⚕️ General Medicine: Perioperative Diabetes Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Perioperative hyperglycemia** increases the risk for **poor wound healing**, **infections**, **cardiovascular events**, and **death**.
2. The **Endocrine Society clinical guidelines** recommend a **preoperative hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target of <8% (63.9 mmol/mol)** before **elective surgery**.
3. The <8% HbA1c recommendation applies to patients scheduled for **elective surgical procedures**, when there is sufficient time to implement therapies to reach this goal.
4. If an HbA1c <8% is not feasible, **preoperative blood glucose** concentrations should be reduced to **100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10 mmol/L)**.
5. The **presence of diabetes mellitus** alone does **not warrant** preoperative **cardiopulmonary stress testing**.
6. A **urinalysis** is not indicated preoperatively unless the patient has **urinary tract infection symptoms** or is undergoing a **urologic procedure**.
7. **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)** is recommended by the **American Diabetes Association (ADA)** for adults requiring **multiple daily insulin injections** or **continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion**, as it improves glycemic control in those settings.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The risk includes both **surgical site complications** and **systemic adverse outcomes**.
2. The 8% HbA1c threshold is a general guideline; tighter control may be appropriate in certain patients.
3. This guideline allows for **treatment optimization** before proceeding with elective procedures.
4. These interim glucose targets help **mitigate risk** if optimal HbA1c goals cannot be achieved in time.
5. Stress testing is reserved for those with **poor functional capacity**, **symptoms**, or **clinical findings** suggestive of coronary disease.
6. A **urine albumin-creatinine ratio** is more sensitive for diabetic kidney disease than urinalysis.
7. This patient was not on insulin, so CGM would **not alone** improve control.
