### 🧠 Rheumatology: Perioperative Management of Antirheumatic Medications

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends that in patients with **rheumatoid arthritis**, **ankylosing spondylitis**, or **psoriatic arthritis** undergoing **total joint replacement**, **biologic medications** should be withheld and surgery should occur immediately after the next dose is due.
2. **Biologic medications** can be restarted after **sutures are removed** and there is **evidence of wound healing**, typically in **14 days**.
3. **Perioperative medication management** in patients with rheumatologic disease should be **co-managed with the patient's rheumatologist**.
4. **Traditional oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**—including **methotrexate**, **leflunomide**, **hydroxychloroquine**, **sulfasalazine**—and **apremilast** can be **continued through the perioperative period**.
5. Continuing **traditional oral DMARDs** perioperatively has **little to no effect on surgical risk**.
6. Several studies have shown that **methotrexate can be continued safely** in the perioperative period.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Biologics are associated with an increased risk for infection, which is why their timing around surgery is critical.
2. Healing should be confirmed before restarting biologic therapy to reduce the risk of postoperative complications.
3. Shared decision-making is important, especially if the patient has a history of difficult-to-control disease.
4. Holding traditional oral DMARDs like methotrexate may lead to disease flare-ups.
5. This recommendation is based on evidence that these agents do not significantly increase infection or healing risks.
6. Withholding methotrexate may precipitate a flare and is generally not necessary in the setting of elective surgery.
