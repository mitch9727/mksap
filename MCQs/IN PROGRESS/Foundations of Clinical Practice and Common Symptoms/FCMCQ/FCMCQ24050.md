### ⚕️ General Medicine: Preoperative Coagulopathy Evaluation

#### ✅ True Statements
1. A careful preoperative bleeding history, including family history, should be obtained from all patients before surgery to evaluate for underlying bleeding disorders and anemia.
2. Patients with a known or suggestive history of coagulopathy should have a preoperative hematology evaluation.
3. Bleeding diatheses, such as **von Willebrand disease**, are common and may remain undiagnosed into adulthood.
4. Bleeding diatheses commonly present with **mucosal bleeding after dental procedures**, **bleeding with minor procedures** such as tonsillectomy, and **menorrhagia** in women.
5. Treatment of bleeding diatheses can improve surgical outcomes and minimize the need for transfusions during surgery.
6. Preoperative anemia is associated with increased complications and mortality.
7. Reversible causes of anemia should be corrected prior to elective surgery to optimize red blood cell mass (e.g., iron replacement for **iron deficiency anemia**).
8. A transfusion threshold of **hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL (70 g/L)** is appropriate for most hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients without cardiovascular risk factors or cardiac/orthopedic surgery.
9. The platelet transfusion threshold for major nonneurologic surgery or lumbar puncture is **50,000/µL (50 × 10⁹/L)**.
10. **Desmopressin**, which stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, may be used prophylactically in some types of **von Willebrand disease**, but diagnostic evaluation is needed before initiating treatment.

#### 💬 Extra
2. This includes patients with a personal and family history of menorrhagia and bleeding with minor surgeries.
8. This patient's anemia is likely due to ongoing menorrhagia and does not currently warrant a blood transfusion.
9. The patient's platelet count is above the transfusion threshold but still requires further evaluation.
10. The patient may have von Willebrand disease, but further diagnostic evaluation is needed before treatment with desmopressin can be considered.
