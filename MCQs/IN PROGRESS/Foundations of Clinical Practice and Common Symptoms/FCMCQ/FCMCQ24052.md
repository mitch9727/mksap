### 🮁 Pulmonology: Preventing Perioperative Pulmonary Complications

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Discontinuation of smoking** improves **surgical outcomes** and decreases the risk for **pulmonary complications**.
2. Patients with **well-controlled asthma** do not routinely require **preoperative pulmonary testing**.
3. Patients with **well-controlled asthma** may continue most **standard asthma medications** through the perioperative period.
4. **Smoking cessation** reduces the risk for **postoperative venous thromboembolism** in patients with newly diagnosed **cancer**.
5. Patients who do not smoke have less **postoperative pain** and a lower risk for **anesthesia complications**.
6. **Cardiopulmonary stress testing** is not indicated for asymptomatic patients with good **functional capacity** undergoing **intermediate-risk surgery**.
7. **Chest radiography** is indicated only in patients with signs or symptoms of **pulmonary illness** or **cardiac/pulmonary disease** with new or unstable symptoms.
8. **Spirometry** is indicated preoperatively only in patients undergoing **lung resection** or those with **active wheezing** or **poor exercise tolerance** not otherwise explained.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Smoking cessation decreases the risk for postoperative infection and poor wound healing.
2. This recommendation applies when asthma is not associated with active symptoms or poor control.
4. The patient's cancer diagnosis increases their baseline thromboembolic risk.
5. Both **acute and chronic** postoperative pain are reduced in nonsmokers.
6. The patient in this scenario is asymptomatic and has good exercise capacity.
7. Routine preoperative chest x-rays are not recommended for asymptomatic individuals with stable chronic lung disease.
8. In the absence of lung resection or unexplained poor exercise tolerance, spirometry does not aid in risk stratification.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients should be asked about recent signs or symptoms of **acute respiratory illness** or **chronic lung disease exacerbation** before surgery.
2. **Pulmonary risk factors** can be categorized as **patient-related** or **procedure-related**.
3. The **ARISCAT score** is a validated tool that estimates risk for **perioperative pulmonary complications**.
4. **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** is associated with **cardiac events**, **pulmonary complications**, and **ICU admissions**.
5. All patients should be **screened for OSA**, and the **STOP-BANG score** is a commonly used tool for this purpose.
6. **Preoperative sleep medicine evaluation** is recommended for patients at high risk for OSA who have **hypoventilation**, **severe/uncontrolled comorbidities**, or **resting hypoxemia** not explained by other cardiopulmonary causes.
7. **Chest radiography** is indicated only for patients with signs or symptoms of **pulmonary illness** or new/unstable **cardiac or pulmonary disease**.
8. **Preoperative spirometry** should not be routinely ordered, including in patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**.
9. There is no spirometric threshold below which surgery is deemed unsafe.
10. **Spirometry** is warranted in patients undergoing **lung resection** to predict **postoperative lung function**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. This initial screening helps identify patients who may need further pulmonary evaluation or testing.
2. Examples of patient-related factors include smoking and OSA; procedure-related factors include surgery duration and type.
3. The ARISCAT score incorporates risk factors such as low preoperative oxygen saturation and surgical site.
4. OSA increases risk for adverse outcomes and must be considered even if not incorporated into formal risk calculators.
5. The STOP-BANG score includes factors like snoring, tiredness, and BMI.
6. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine provides this recommendation despite limited data on delaying surgery for OSA alone.
7. This duplicates the main section guidance and reinforces criteria for imaging.
8. Routine spirometry lacks predictive value in the absence of specific clinical indicators.
9. This reinforces that spirometry results should not automatically preclude surgery.
10. Lung resection alters lung volume significantly, warranting formal function assessment.
