### ⚕️ General Medicine: Perioperative Anticoagulation Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. The perioperative management of oral anticoagulants depends on the **risk for thromboembolism**, the **bleeding risk from surgery**, and the **pharmacokinetics** of the oral anticoagulant used.
2. A **three-tiered bleeding risk classification** exists for surgeries: **minimal risk (~0%)**, **low- to moderate risk (<2%)**, and **high risk (>2%)**.
3. Patients undergoing **low- to moderate-risk** or **high-risk** surgical procedures should have **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** withheld preoperatively.
4. Most DOACs can be stopped **24 hours before low- to moderate-risk procedures** and **48 hours before high-risk procedures**, provided **kidney function is sufficient**.
5. Most DOACs are typically resumed **24 hours after low- to moderate-risk surgeries** and **48 to 72 hours after high-risk surgeries**.
6. **Apixaban** does **not** require discontinuation **72 hours** before surgery in patients with normal kidney function.
7. **Apixaban** does **not** need to be stopped **5 days** before surgery; doing so would unnecessarily increase **thromboembolic risk**.
8. **Warfarin**, due to its pharmacokinetics, is typically stopped **5 days before surgery**.
9. **Dabigatran**, which is more dependent on **renal clearance**, may need to be stopped **2 to 4 days preoperatively** in patients with a **creatinine clearance <50 mL/min**.
10. Continuing **apixaban** without interruption is only appropriate for **minimal-risk procedures** with negligible bleeding risk.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Relevant pharmacologic features include half-life and route of excretion, which guide when to withhold or resume therapy.
2. Examples include **cataract surgery** (minimal risk), **hernia repair or colonoscopy** (low to moderate risk), and **cardiac surgery or kidney biopsy** (high risk).
3. Stopping anticoagulants reduces the chance of significant bleeding in surgeries with non-negligible risk.
4. Sufficient kidney function typically refers to a **creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min**.
5. These resumption windows balance bleeding and thrombotic risks.
6. Longer interruption may be warranted in **renal impairment**.
7. Overly long discontinuation increases risk of **stroke or systemic embolism** in patients with **atrial fibrillation**.
8. Warfarin has a **longer half-life** and **delayed offset**, necessitating earlier cessation.
9. Dabigatran’s elimination is highly dependent on **renal clearance**, unlike apixaban.
10. Continuing apixaban in **low- to moderate-risk** procedures is inappropriate due to measurable bleeding risk.
