### 🫀 Cardiology: Perioperative Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. In patients with a history of **coronary stent placement**, the minimum recommended duration of **dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** is 14 days after balloon angioplasty, 30 days after **bare metal stent** implantation, and 6 months after **drug-eluting stent** placement for **chronic coronary disease**.
2. For patients who underwent **drug-eluting stent** placement for **acute coronary syndrome**, the minimum recommended DAPT duration is 12 months.
3. **Elective surgery** should be deferred until the minimum DAPT duration has been completed.
4. **Aspirin** is ideally continued through the **perioperative period** to decrease the risk of a **major adverse cardiovascular event**.
5. **P2Y12 inhibitors**, such as **clopidogrel**, are generally held perioperatively to reduce **bleeding risk**.
6. After surgery, **dual antiplatelet therapy** should be **restarted as soon as bleeding risk is decreased**.
7. **Perioperative dual antiplatelet therapy management** should be discussed in concert with the **patient's surgeon and cardiologist**.
8. For patients undergoing **elective noncardiac surgery** and receiving **dual antiplatelet therapy**, it is generally recommended that **clopidogrel be discontinued** perioperatively.
9. Continuing both **aspirin and clopidogrel** perioperatively may increase **bleeding risk** without clear benefit.
10. Withholding **aspirin** perioperatively, either alone or in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor, is not recommended.

#### 💬 Extra
1. These durations are derived from **American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology** perioperative guidelines.
2. This extended timeline reflects increased thrombotic risk in the setting of **acute coronary syndrome**.
3. Delaying surgery allows completion of therapy critical for stent patency and event prevention.
4. Aspirin continuation is considered a **protective measure** against perioperative cardiac events.
5. Clopidogrel increases surgical bleeding and is usually held for 5 days prior to surgery.
6. Resumption timing of DAPT must balance thrombotic and bleeding risks.
7. Collaborative planning helps optimize **risk-benefit decision-making**.
8. There is limited outcome data, but expert consensus supports holding **clopidogrel**.
9. Bleeding risks often outweigh unclear perioperative benefits of continuing both agents.
10. Discontinuing aspirin increases cardiovascular risk and is avoided unless bleeding risk is prohibitively high.
