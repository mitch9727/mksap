### ⚕️ Perioperative Medicine: Low-Risk Surgery and Preoperative Testing

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Cataract extraction** is a **low-risk surgical procedure** that requires **no specific diagnostic studies** for preoperative evaluation.
2. For **low-risk invasive procedures**, including **hernia repair** and **superficial surgeries**, **routine preoperative diagnostic testing** is discouraged.
3. **Diagnostic testing** before low-risk surgery should be ordered **only if otherwise indicated** outside the preoperative context.
4. **Preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG)** is not indicated for **asymptomatic patients** undergoing **low-risk procedures**.
5. **Preoperative ECG** is reasonable for patients with **known cardiovascular disease**, **arrhythmia**, **structural heart disease**, or **cardiovascular symptoms** undergoing **moderate- to high-risk surgeries**.
6. **Hemoglobin testing** is appropriate for patients with **anemia risk factors** or undergoing **surgery with expected blood loss**, but not routinely before **low-risk eye surgery**.
7. Evaluation of **serum electrolyte** and **creatinine levels** is not necessary before **low-risk surgery** in **asymptomatic patients**, even with **chronic disease** or **relevant medications**.
8. Measuring **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)** preoperatively is reasonable only in patients with **symptoms of thyroid disease** or **recent changes in levothyroxine dosage**.
9. **Low-risk surgery** does not require **TSH testing** in patients without **recent thyroid medication changes** or **thyroid symptoms**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. **Cataract surgery** is considered **ambulatory and minimally invasive** with negligible physiological stress.
2. These procedures are unlikely to have **perioperative complications** impacted by routine lab testing.
3. Preoperative labs should not be used as a blanket screening tool when **clinical history and physical exam are unremarkable**.
4. **Asymptomatic individuals** with **no known cardiovascular conditions** derive no benefit from ECG prior to **low-risk surgery**.
5. Examples of moderate- to high-risk surgeries include **major abdominal**, **intrathoracic**, or **vascular procedures**.
6. **Hemoglobin testing** is unnecessary unless there is **clinical suspicion of anemia** or high-risk surgical profile.
7. Medications like **diuretics** or **ACE inhibitors** do not justify lab testing in otherwise **stable patients** prior to low-risk procedures.
8. TSH testing applies to those with **clinical signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism**.
9. Stability in thyroid disease is defined by **unchanged medication dosing** and **absence of new symptoms**.

**Abbreviations and Notes:**  
GI = gastrointestinal; ISTH = International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.  
a. Minimal to no residual anticoagulant effect at time of procedure (i.e., four to five drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure).  
b. Includes spinal and epidural anesthesia or any other neuraxial (e.g., pain management) intervention; consider not only absolute risk for major bleeding but potentially devastating consequences of epidural bleeding and associated lower limb paralysis.  
c. Some residual anticoagulant effect allowed (i.e., two to three drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure).  
d. Radial approach may be considered minimal-bleed-risk compared with femoral approach.  
e. Procedure can be safely done under full-dose anticoagulation (may consider holding direct oral anticoagulant dose day of procedure to avoid peak anticoagulant effects).
