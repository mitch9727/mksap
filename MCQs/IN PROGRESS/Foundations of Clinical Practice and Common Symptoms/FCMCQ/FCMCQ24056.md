### 🫀 Foundations of Clinical Practice: Surgery Timing After Coronary Stenting

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients who have undergone **coronary stenting** are at increased risk for **ischemic events** after **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**.
2. The risk for post-PCI ischemic events is higher in patients who received a stent after an **acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**.
3. The timing of **elective noncardiac surgery** after coronary stenting must consider **stent thrombosis risk**, **surgical urgency**, and **bleeding risk**.
4. The **American Heart Association (AHA)** and **American College of Cardiology (ACC)** guidelines recommend **uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** for:
   - 30 days after **bare metal stent** placement
   - 6 months after **drug-eluting stent (DES)** placement for **chronic coronary disease**
   - Ideally 12 months after **DES placement for an ACS**
5. **Elective noncardiac surgery** should be delayed to allow **completion of the recommended DAPT duration**.
6. If **surgical delay** is not possible and the patient has completed at least 3 months of DAPT after DES placement, **discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitors** may be considered.
7. **Low-dose aspirin** should be continued if at all possible during the perioperative period.
8. **DAPT** should be **restarted** as soon as the **bleeding risk** has sufficiently diminished postoperatively.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The increased ischemic risk is due to the potential for **stent thrombosis** in the perioperative period.
2. **ACS-related PCI** implies more unstable plaque and higher thrombotic risk compared to elective PCI.
3. Early surgery could necessitate **premature DAPT discontinuation**, increasing risk for **thrombosis** or **myocardial infarction**.
4. These guideline durations are designed to allow for **endothelialization** of the stent and reduce the risk of **thrombosis**.
5. Delaying surgery in patients with DES after ACS reduces both **cardiac and bleeding complications**.
6. This option applies only if the **risk of surgical delay exceeds the risk of thrombosis**.
7. **Aspirin continuation** minimizes ischemic complications without substantially increasing bleeding risk.
8. Restarting DAPT promptly post-surgery helps prevent **late stent thrombosis**.
