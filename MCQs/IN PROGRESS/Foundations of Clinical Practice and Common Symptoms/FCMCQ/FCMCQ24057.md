### ⚕️ Endocrinology: Perioperative Glucocorticoid Management in Adrenal Insufficiency

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Patients with **primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency**, **cushingoid features**, or those taking **more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for more than 3 weeks** require **stress doses of glucocorticoids perioperatively**.
2. Patients with **adrenal insufficiency** are unable to mount an appropriate increase in **cortisol** during surgery or illness, necessitating stress dosing to prevent **adrenal crisis**.
3. For **minor procedures** using only **local anesthesia**, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency should take **twice their usual dose of glucocorticoids** on the day of surgery and for **1 to 2 days after**.
4. For **non-minor surgical procedures**, patients with adrenal insufficiency should receive **100 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone at induction** followed by **continuous infusion of 200 mg/day** of intravenous hydrocortisone until oral glucocorticoids can be resumed.
5. **Hydrocortisone should never be withheld** in patients with adrenal insufficiency, as doing so may precipitate **adrenal crisis**.
6. Continuing the **usual dose of hydrocortisone** without adjustment perioperatively is inadequate and might precipitate **adrenal crisis**.
7. Patients at **low risk** for adrenal insufficiency, including those taking **less than 5 mg/day of prednisone**, those who have taken glucocorticoids for **less than 3 weeks**, and those using **low-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids**, **do not require stress dosing**.

#### 💬 Extra
1. High-risk patients include those with confirmed adrenal insufficiency, chronic steroid therapy exceeding physiological doses, or Cushing syndrome phenotype.
2. The inability to increase cortisol in response to surgical stress can result in hypotension, shock, or death if not preemptively treated.
3. A dental extraction is an example of a minor procedure where this doubled dosing applies.
4. This protocol is based on guidance from the Association of Anaesthetists.
5. Withholding glucocorticoids in this population is contraindicated under all circumstances.
6. The stress of surgery increases glucocorticoid demand; baseline dosing is insufficient.
7. These low-risk scenarios reflect situations where the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is not suppressed.
