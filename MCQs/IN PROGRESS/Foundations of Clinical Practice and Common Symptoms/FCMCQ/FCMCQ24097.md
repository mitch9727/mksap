### 🩺 Foundations of Clinical Practice: Patient Confidentiality

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Physicians have an **ethical** and **legal** obligation to protect the privacy and confidentiality of their patients' medical information.
2. Disclosure of medical information outside the patient–physician relationship requires **explicit patient consent**.
3. Sharing a patient's information without consent or knowledge **violates confidentiality** and may erode trust in the patient–physician relationship.
4. The same confidentiality standards apply to **electronic health records (EHRs)**, patient portals, email, and other electronic communication as to traditional verbal or written communication.
5. Physicians must obtain patient consent before discussing medical information with **family members** or other third parties.
6. Modifying a patient's medication regimen based solely on information from an unsolicited third party, **without direct patient evaluation**, is inappropriate and breaches confidentiality.

#### 💬 Extra
1. A face‑to‑face visit allows the physician to assess symptoms directly and, if desired, obtain written authorization for information sharing.  
2. Confidentiality obligations encompass **all forms of communication**, including verbal, written, and electronic.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. Protecting the privacy of patients' medical information **respects patient autonomy**, fosters trust, and encourages honest disclosure of sensitive personal details, thereby improving care.
2. Discussing patient information in **public places** or through **unsecured channels** (such as unencrypted text messages) violates confidentiality.
3. **Secure communication and storage systems**, including encrypted **electronic health records (EHRs)**, email, and patient portals, should be used when communicating about patients.
4. Physicians must understand and comply with state and federal confidentiality laws, including the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996**.
5. Physicians are **mandatory reporters** of child or elder abuse, certain infectious diseases, and situations in which a patient poses a threat to self or others, making limited disclosure permissible without patient consent.
6. Under **therapeutic privilege**, physicians may temporarily withhold medical information from a patient if disclosure would cause serious harm, but this decision should be made in consultation with an institutional ethics committee.

#### 💬 Extra
1. Respecting confidentiality supports shared decision‑making by preserving the patient's sense of control.  
5. Mandatory reporting is intended to prevent greater harm and is governed by jurisdiction‑specific statutes.  
6. Therapeutic privilege is rarely invoked and requires careful ethical justification and documentation.
