### 🫀 Dermatology: Actinic Purpura — Diagnosis & Management

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Actinic purpura** is a **benign dermatologic condition** that is **common in older adults**.
2. **Actinic purpura** appears as **ecchymotic macules or patches** on **sun-exposed areas** (most commonly the **forearms** and **backs of the hands**).
3. **Actinic purpura** results from **minor trauma** to **thin skin** with **fragile blood vessels** due to **blood vessel fragility** and **dermal atrophy** associated with aging.
4. The **hallmarks of actinic purpura** include **stellate pseudoscars** (atrophic scars after skin tears) and **purpuric macules or patches**.
5. The **diagnosis of actinic purpura** is **clinical**; **skin biopsy** or **other testing** is **not required**.
6. There is **no specific treatment** required for **actinic purpura**; **sun protection** is **recommended** to **prevent further damage**.
7. **Emollient creams** used to treat **dryness (xerosis)** have **no role** in the **treatment of actinic purpura**.
8. **Actinic purpura** is **not pruritic**; **topical anti-itch medications** such as **hydrocortisone** **do not** reduce lesion formation and **may exacerbate skin fragility**.

#### 💬 Extra
- [2] Typical **sun-exposed sites** for actinic purpura include the **forearms** and **backs of the hands**, as illustrated by the **forearm** lesion in the figure *Actinic Purpura and Solar Lentigines*.
- [3] Examples of **minor trauma** that can precipitate actinic purpura include **scratching**; the precipitating trauma acts on **age-related blood vessel fragility** and **dermal atrophy**.
- [4] **Stellate pseudoscars** represent **atrophic scars** that **occur after skin tears** in fragile, aged skin.
- [5] For actinic purpura, **no additional testing needs to be performed** when the **clinical appearance** is characteristic.
- [6] For actinic purpura, **no treatment is available or required** beyond **sun protection** to **prevent further damage**.
- [7] **Emollients** are appropriate for **xerosis** (dry skin) management but **do not prevent ecchymoses** of actinic purpura; see Related Text statements **5** and **9**.
- [8] Because actinic purpura is **not pruritic**, **hydrocortisone** provides **no benefit** and may **worsen skin fragility** in aged skin.

#### ✅ True Statements — Dermatologic Conditions of Aging
1. **Dryness (xerosis cutis)** is **one of the most prevalent skin conditions** in **aging adults**.
2. With aging, **pilosebaceous glands enlarge**, yet **sebum production decreases by ~50%**.
3. **Xerosis** occurs **more often in winter** (low humidity) and typically affects the **lower legs**.
4. **Xerosis** presents as **dry, fissured patches** with a **scalelike appearance**.
5. **Xerosis treatment** consists of **avoiding hot baths**, using **mild synthetic detergent soaps**, and applying **emollients frequently**, **especially immediately after bathing**.
6. **Excessive xerosis** may cause **xerotic dermatitis** (also called **xerotic eczema**, **eczema craquelé**, or **asteatotic eczema**).
7. **Severe xerotic dermatitis** produces **erythematous lesions** with **plate-like cracked scale** resembling a **dried-up creek bed**.
8. Although **aging** is the **most common cause** of **xerotic dermatitis**, **hypothyroidism** and **diuretic medications** may also be implicated.
9. **Xerotic dermatitis treatment** includes a **medium-potency topical glucocorticoid** in an **ointment base**, **discontinued when inflammation subsides**, followed by **liberal emollients** to **prevent recurrence**.
10. **Solar lentigines** are **tan or light brown**, **1–3 cm**, **well-defined macules or patches** on **sun-exposed areas** of **older adults** and are commonly called **“liver spots.”**
11. **Ephelides (freckles)** are **2–5 mm tan macules** on **sun-exposed areas** that **appear in childhood** and **darken with sun exposure**.
12. When **solar lentigines** or **ephelides** are **larger than 1 cm** or **irregular in shape**, **melanoma** is in the **differential diagnosis**, and **biopsy should be considered**.
13. **Xerotic dermatitis** is characterized by **fine, porcelain-like cracks** on **eczematous skin** of the **anterior leg**.
14. **Severe xerotic dermatitis** is characterized by **redness** and a **tile-like pattern** on **xerotic (dry) skin** with **evidence of trauma from scratching**.
15. **Severe xerotic dermatitis** **typically occurs during mid winter in northern climates**.
16. **Solar lentigines** occur in **middle-aged to older persons with fair skin** in **sun-damaged areas**.
17. **Solar lentigines** may be **difficult to distinguish from melanoma**; **more homogeneous pigmentation** and **lighter color** are **useful discriminating characteristics** favoring **solar lentigines**.
18. **Actinic purpura** and **solar lentigines** can **coexist on atrophic skin** and **demonstrate signs of aging**.

#### 💬 Extra (from Related Text)
- [2] The coexistence of **larger pilosebaceous glands** with **reduced sebum** explains why **xerosis** is common despite gland enlargement.
- [3] The **winter predominance** of xerosis corresponds to **low ambient humidity**; this seasonal pattern aligns with the **mid-winter** clustering of **severe xerotic dermatitis** in northern climates (see statement **15**).
- [7] The visual description of **“dried-up creek bed”** corresponds to the **plate-like cracked scale** of **severe xerotic dermatitis**.
- [12] The recommendation to **consider biopsy** when **lesions exceed 1 cm** or are **irregular** is specifically to evaluate for **melanoma** in the differential diagnosis.
- [17] **Homogeneous pigmentation** and **lighter color** are practical features to **differentiate solar lentigines** from **melanoma**, as shown in the figure *Solar Lentigines*.
- [18] In the image *Actinic Purpura and Solar Lentigines*, the **white arrow** indicates **actinic purpura** and the **black arrow** indicates **solar lentigines**, exemplifying their **coexistence** on **atrophic skin**.
