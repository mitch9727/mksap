### 🧠 Neurology: Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis After Intracerebral Hemorrhage

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)** prophylaxis can be started **24 hours after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)** when **neuroimaging shows no active bleeding**, to prevent **deep venous thrombosis (DVT)**.
2. **Severe limb weakness (hemiparesis)** after **stroke** confers **high risk** for developing **DVT**.
3. **Deep venous thrombosis** is the **leading complication** of **hospitalization for stroke**.
4. **Deep venous thrombosis** is found in **approximately 11%** of **immobile patients** at **1 week** after **stroke**.
5. **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**, which typically originates from **DVT**, occurs in **approximately 1%** of **patients with stroke**.
6. **External sequential compression devices** may be used for **DVT prophylaxis** **before pharmacologic prophylaxis** is initiated after **ICH**.
7. **Aspirin** is **not effective** as **DVT prophylaxis** in **hospitalized patients** and **should not be used** for this purpose.
8. **Thigh-high graduated compression stockings** **do not prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE)** after **stroke with substantial leg weakness** and are associated with **increased skin complications** (breaks, ulcers, blisters, necrosis).
9. **Warfarin** **monotherapy** is **not adequate** for **immediate or short-term DVT prophylaxis** because its **anticoagulant effect is delayed** by **36 to 72 hours**.
10. **Early warfarin use** after **ICH** **increases the risk** for **expansion of intracranial hemorrhage** and is **not appropriate** for **prophylaxis** in this setting.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The **24-hour LMWH start** assumes **repeat neuroimaging** (for example, **two CT scans 24 hours apart**) shows **no active bleeding** or **hemorrhage expansion**.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Admission to a specialized stroke unit** is associated with a **reduced long-term risk of all-cause mortality** after **stroke**.
2. **Specialized stroke units** improve outcomes by using **multidisciplinary care teams** that follow **structured protocols**.
3. **Head-of-bed elevation** and **aggressive oral hygiene** help **prevent aspiration pneumonia** after **stroke**, whereas **nasogastric** or **percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tubes** **do not prevent** aspiration pneumonia.
4. **Prophylactic antibiotics** should be **avoided** in **stroke** patients, **even in high-risk individuals**.
5. **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)** are **common after stroke**; care protocols include **screening for urinary retention** and **avoiding or removing indwelling urinary catheters**.
6. **Early mobilization** with **specially trained therapists** may **reduce medical complications** and **hasten recovery** after **stroke**.
7. **Pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis** should be **initiated for all patients with stroke**.
8. In **ischemic stroke**, **VTE prophylaxis** should **begin on admission**, **except** when **intravenous alteplase** is used, in which case a **24-hour neuroimaging study without hemorrhage** is **required before prophylaxis**.
9. In **hemorrhagic stroke**, **subcutaneous heparin** or **enoxaparin** should be **started 24 hours after ICH** if **imaging shows no evidence of expansion**, and in **subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)** pharmacologic prophylaxis should **begin after the aneurysm is secured**.
10. **Supplemental oxygen** for **normoxic** patients with **stroke** **increases mortality**; guidelines recommend **avoiding oxygen** unless **oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is ≤94%**.

#### 💬 Extra
8. The **alteplase exception** prevents **hemorrhagic transformation**; a **repeat head CT** at **24 hours** is standard prior to starting **antithrombotic therapy**.
9. The **SAH timing** reflects the need to **secure the aneurysm** to avoid **rebleeding** before starting **pharmacologic prophylaxis**.
