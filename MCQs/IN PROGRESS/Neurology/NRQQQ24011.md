### 🧠 Neurology: Convulsive Status Epilepticus Management in Phenytoin Allergy

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE)** is defined as a **generalized tonic–clonic seizure** lasting more than **5 minutes** or **two such seizures within 5 minutes** without return to baseline between seizures.
2. Initial management of **convulsive status epilepticus** requires **rapid assessment** of **airway, breathing, and circulation** and measurement of **blood glucose level**.
3. According to **American Epilepsy Society guidelines**, **intramuscular midazolam**, **intravenous lorazepam**, and **intravenous diazepam** are considered **equivalent first-line agents** for the initial treatment of **convulsive status epilepticus**.
4. **Second-line therapy** for **convulsive status epilepticus** is initiated if seizures persist after **one dose of intramuscular midazolam** or **two doses of intravenous lorazepam or diazepam**.
5. **Fosphenytoin**, a prodrug of **phenytoin**, is preferred over phenytoin because it can be administered more rapidly and carries a lower risk of **thrombophlebitis** and **skin necrosis** from extravasation.
6. **Valproate** and **levetiracetam** are appropriate **second-line therapies** for **convulsive status epilepticus** in patients who are **allergic to phenytoin** or have **primary generalized epilepsy**.
7. **Brain MRI** is not indicated during ongoing **convulsive status epilepticus** because it would delay treatment; imaging may be considered once seizures are controlled.
8. **Electroencephalography (EEG)** should not delay treatment of **convulsive status epilepticus** but may be considered after seizure control.

#### 💬 Extra
1. The patient scenario involved persistent **convulsive status epilepticus** 5 minutes after a second dose of lorazepam, with a history of **phenytoin allergy**, prompting intravenous valproate administration.
5. **Phenytoin extravasation** can cause **purple glove syndrome**, a complication characterized by pain, edema, and skin necrosis.

#### ✅ True Statements
1. **Convulsive status epilepticus** is diagnosed clinically and presents as **continuous generalized clonic jerking of the entire body**.
2. Empiric therapy for **convulsive status epilepticus** should be initiated without awaiting **electroencephalography (EEG)**, imaging, serum studies, or lumbar puncture unless **psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)** are strongly suspected.
3. The **first steps** in **convulsive status epilepticus** management are **securing the airway** and **obtaining intravenous access**.
4. If **point-of-care glucose testing** is unavailable or **hypoglycemia** is present, **thiamine** should be given, followed by **intravenous glucose**.
5. **First-line treatment** for **convulsive status epilepticus** is an **intravenous benzodiazepine** or **intramuscular midazolam**.
6. If intravenous access is not available, **diazepam** can be given **rectally** or **intramuscularly**, though absorption is **erratic**.
7. Fear of **respiratory depression** should not delay benzodiazepine treatment; benzodiazepine use is associated with **lower intubation rates** in **convulsive status epilepticus**.
8. To prevent seizure recurrence, benzodiazepines should be followed by **intravenous antiseizure drug (ASD) second-line therapy**.
9. Both **fosphenytoin** and **phenytoin** can cause **acute bradycardia** and **hypotension**.
10. Alternative **second-line therapies** for **convulsive status epilepticus** include **intravenous valproate** or **intravenous levetiracetam**.
11. Evidence is insufficient to support **lacosamide** as standard treatment for **convulsive status epilepticus**.
12. If convulsions stop but mental status does not improve within **10 minutes** or return to baseline within **30 minutes**, **continuous EEG** should be performed to diagnose **nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE)**.
13. **Nonconvulsive status epilepticus** after **convulsive status epilepticus** remains a medical emergency and should be treated aggressively.
14. If convulsive seizure activity continues, **intubation** and induction of an **anesthetic coma** for **24–48 hours** with **propofol**, **midazolam**, or **pentobarbital** may be required.
15. **Thiopental** is available for this purpose outside the United States.
16. **Continuous EEG monitoring** is mandatory when patients are in an **anesthetically induced coma** for **convulsive status epilepticus**.
17. **Pentobarbital** is associated with **hypotension** and may **accumulate in tissues**, leading to prolonged clearance.
18. **Midazolam** carries lower morbidity but may result in **tolerance** and **tachyphylaxis**.
19. If intravenous access is not possible in **convulsive status epilepticus**, **rectal or intramuscular diazepam** can be administered.
20. In **convulsive status epilepticus**, an alternative **second-line antiseizure drug** may be used instead of the default recommended agent.
21. **Thiopental** is not available for the treatment of **convulsive status epilepticus** in the United States.

#### 💬 Extra
2. Delay in treatment increases the risk of neuronal injury and poor outcomes in **convulsive status epilepticus**.
14. Induction of anesthetic coma is considered **third-line therapy** for **refractory status epilepticus**.
19. Statement 19 is based on footnote <sup>a</sup> from the algorithm figure.
20. Statement 20 is based on footnote <sup>b</sup> from the algorithm figure.
21. Statement 21 is based on footnote <sup>c</sup> from the algorithm figure.
