  "critique": "This chest radiograph shows left lung atelectasis (Option B) caused by obstruction of the left main bronchus. There is diffuse, dense opacification of the left hemithorax. In addition, there is a loss of volume on the left, as indicated by the leftward movement of the mediastinum and trachea. Although mediastinal borders are difficult to discern, the absence of a right heart border to the right of the spine indicates the leftward movement of the heart. The heart's position can also be inferred by the leftward position of the pulmonary artery catheter. Main bronchus obstruction, as in this patient, could be due to aspirated material or large mucus plugs.",
