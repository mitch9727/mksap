  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is right mainstem intubation (Option C). The frontal chest radiograph shows the tip of the endotracheal tube (black arrowheads) positioned within the right mainstem bronchus. The tip of an endotracheal tube should normally be positioned below the thoracic inlet (white arrow) and at least 2 cm above the carina (black arrow). Intubation of the right mainstem bronchus either initially or because of tube migration may result in underinflation or atelectasis of individual left lung lobes or the entire left lung. In this patient, right upper lobe atelectasis has occurred, as indicated by the homogeneous opacification of the right upper mid-chest region, with a well-demarcated, smooth concave edge representing the superiorly and medially displaced minor fissure (white arrowheads) and upward displacement of the right hemidiaphragm. Right upper lobe atelectasis likely resulted from obstruction of the right upper lobe bronchus by the endotracheal tube. The tube should be pulled back several centimeters and a repeat chest radiograph obtained.",
