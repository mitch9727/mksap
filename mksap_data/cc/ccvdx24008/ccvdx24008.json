It is characterized by increased fingertip mass and nail plate curvature. Digital clubbing can be acquired or hereditary. Acquired bilateral clubbing is often associated with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, including lung cancer, COPD, and interstitial lung disease.In contrast, onycholysis is defined as distal separation of the nail plate from the underlying nail bed. It is usually associated with trauma, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and certain medications.
