  "question_text": "A 34-year-old man is evaluated for 1 week of worsening pain and swelling of the left knee. He recently began a new job as a house cleaner, and the pain interferes with his ability to work, which involves frequent kneeling. He reports no fever, chills, or trauma to the knee. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Gait is normal. A tender fluctuant swelling is present anterior to the left patella. Overlying skin is erythematous but intact. Range of motion of the left knee is normal. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management of this patient with prepatellar bursitis is fluid aspiration and analysis to identify the underlying cause (Option A). Prepatellar bursitis is caused by inflammation of the bursa anterior to the patella, which may be acute or chronic. Acute prepatellar bursitis may be caused by trauma, infection (septic bursitis), gout, or other inflammatory rheumatologic disorders. The chronic form usually results from repetitive trauma but may also be caused by gout, rheumatologic disorders, or indolent infections such as those caused by mycobacteria or fungi. More than one cause of prepatellar bursitis may be present at once. For example, patients with bursitis secondary to repetitive trauma are at risk for development of septic bursitis resulting from skin microabrasions that may not be apparent on examination. Similarly, septic bursitis can coexist with gout. The diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis is made clinically, as the examination reveals a localized fluid collection anterior to the patella. Erythema and tenderness are often present in acute disease but may be absent in the chronic form. Ultrasonography may be used to guide aspiration, but imaging is not necessary. Because no examination findings reliably identify the underlying cause or exclude infection, fluid aspiration and analysis are recommended for all patients with prepatellar bursitis, regardless of duration. Fluid analysis should include leukocyte count, Gram stain, culture, crystal examination, and glucose levels. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause(s). This patient has acute prepatellar bursitis, as evidenced by pain, swelling, and an erythematous and tender prepatellar fluid collection. The most appropriate next step is fluid aspiration and analysis.Glucocorticoid injection (Option B) may be employed as a treatment strategy for many musculoskeletal conditions, including de Quervain tendinopathy, acute crystal arthropathy, and osteoarthritis. Exclusion of infection before injection, however, is necessary. Glucocorticoid injection is additionally not a recommended treatment for prepatellar bursitis unless acute crystal arthropathy is present.NSAID therapy such as ibuprofen (Option C) plays a role in the management of chronic prepatellar arthritis from repetitive trauma, and it may help alleviate pain in all kinds of bursitis. It would be inappropriate to recommend NSAID monotherapy in this patient without first excluding other causes, such as septic or gouty bursitis.Physical therapy (Option D) is not helpful in the treatment of prepatellar bursitis. Even when infection and gout have been excluded and chronic bursitis caused by repetitive trauma is the diagnosis, treatment is centered on activity modification rather than physical therapy.",
