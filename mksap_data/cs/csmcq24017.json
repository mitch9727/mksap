  "question_text": "A 68-year-old woman is evaluated for chronic pain and constipation. She has a history of chronic back pain secondary to vertebral compression fractures and participates in physical therapy and a cognitive behavioral therapy group for chronic pain. She started as-needed oxycodone 1 year ago following unsuccessful trials of nonopioid pharmacotherapy. She uses oxycodone once or twice daily and has not escalated her dose. Her pain is well controlled with these measures; however, over the past 2 months she has developed hard, infrequent stools and abdominal bloating. She increased her water and dietary fiber intake without relief of symptoms. Other than osteoporosis, she has no other health problems. Her other medications are calcium, vitamin D, and alendronate.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Normal bowel sounds are present. The abdomen is firmly distended and mildly tender to deep palpation in the lower quadrants, with no rebound or guarding. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is to initiate an over-the-counter laxative such as senna (Option D). Constipation is a common adverse effect of opioid therapy resulting from reduced gastrointestinal motility. Tolerance to opioid-related constipation (ORC) does not develop over time. Owing to their effectiveness, safety, availability, and low cost, over-the-counter laxatives are recommended as first-line treatments for ORC. Stimulant laxatives (such as senna or bisacodyl) or osmotic laxatives (such as polyethylene glycol) are strongly recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association for the treatment of ORC. These agents should ideally be prescribed concurrently with initiation of opioid therapy, but they are effective at treating constipation any time during the course of therapy. This patient taking chronic opioid therapy with ORC should start a stimulant laxative, such as senna.Constipation is an expected adverse effect of chronic opioid therapy, and it can be safely and effectively managed. In the absence of other adverse effects, discontinuation of this patient's effective regimen for chronic pain (Option A) is not appropriate.Lubiprostone (Option B) is an intestinal secretagogue used in the management of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. No evidence or recommendations for its use in ORC exist, and it should not be used in this scenario.If maximal over-the-counter therapy has failed to achieve laxation, a peripheral opioid antagonist such as naldemedine (Option C) is recommended. These medications do not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore do not affect analgesia; however, they are contraindicated in patients at risk for bowel obstruction. This patient should be given an adequate trial of a stimulant and/or osmotic laxative before initiating naldemedine.",
  "key_points": [
    "First-line pharmacologic therapy for opioid-related constipation is over-the-counter stimulants such as senna or bisacodyl and osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol.",
    "Opioid-related constipation is very common, and an over-the-counter stimulant or osmotic laxative should ideally be prescribed concurrently with initiation of opioid therapy."
