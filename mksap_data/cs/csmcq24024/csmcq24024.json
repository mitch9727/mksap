  "question_text": "A 75-year-old man is evaluated for neck pain. The pain is centered in the posterior neck and shoots down both arms. He has also noted numbness in the hands bilaterally and has developed gait instability over the past 2 weeks. He reports no fever, chills, weight loss, loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, or recent trauma. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Cranial nerves are intact. Muscle strength is 4+/5 in the upper and lower extremities. Patellar deep tendon reflexes are 3+ with upgoing extensor reflexes of the toes.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with likely cervical myelopathy is urgent cervical MRI (Option A). Cervical myelopathy in older patients is usually the result of degenerative disease of the spine and disks (spondylosis). Signs and symptoms are related to spinal cord and nerve root compression and include weakness, sensory changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, and difficulty walking. In addition to weakness in the upper and lower extremities, examination may show lower motor neuron signs (decreased reflexes and fasciculations) at the level of compression with upper motor signs (increased reflexes, clonus, and upgoing extensor signs) below this level. Gait disturbances related to spasticity and loss of proprioception can occur. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, as CT and plain radiography do not provide adequate visualization of the spinal cord or nerve roots. CT myelography is an invasive second-line test used only when MRI is contraindicated. Surgical treatment is often necessary. The neck pain and upper and lower motor signs in this patient suggest the presence of cervical myelopathy, and he should undergo cervical MRI.A lumbar puncture (Option B) would be indicated for the evaluation of possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and other inflammatory processes of the central nervous system. GBS is typically characterized by an acute ascending paralysis accompanied by areflexia in the lower extremities, neither of which is present in this patient.Neck radiography (Option C) is not an appropriate imaging choice in this patient. Although neck radiography may show bony abnormalities suggesting spondylosis or a compression fracture, plain radiographs cannot be used to diagnose myelopathy or nerve root compromise. This patient has findings suspicious for a myelopathic process, and MRI should be completed to determine the cause and help direct potential surgical therapy.Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (Option D) are helpful in the differentiation of neuromuscular disorders, including motor neuron disease and peripheral neuropathy. Because this patient has upper motor signs, the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is in the differential diagnosis. However, the patient has neck pain and neurologic signs that localize the pathology to the cervical spinal cord, all of which make cervical myelopathy more likely than motor neuron disease. MRI is the next best test.",
