  "question_text": "A 68-year-old man on an airplane flight has a cardiac arrest. An automatic external defibrillator is employed by a physician onboard, a shockable rhythm is detected, and pulse is established after the defibrillator shock. The patient now reports mild chest pain. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Medications are metformin, semaglutide, insulin glargine, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. He has no allergies.On physical examination, the patient appears pale and is awake but lethargic. Temperature is 36.8 °C (98.2 °F), blood pressure is 96/56 mm Hg, pulse rate is 62/min, and respiration rate is 14/min. Oxygen saturation is 96% with the patient breathing ambient air. Jugular venous distension is noted. Cardiac examination reveals regular rhythm without murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation.Glucometer shows a normal glucose level.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is to recommend flight diversion (Option C). In-flight medical events are relatively common during air travel and, although cardiac arrest is rare, it is the cause of most in-flight deaths. The physician's role during any in-flight medical event involves assessing the patient, establishing a diagnosis when possible, administering basic medical treatment, providing reassurance as appropriate, and recommending flight diversion if necessary. Most airlines contract with 24-hour call centers staffed with emergency medicine physicians with special training on the in-flight environment. Such support is accessed through the pilot, and direct communication between the physician providing assistance and the ground-based support physician may not always be possible. Although not all in-flight medical events require flight diversion, the physician should recommend immediate diversion if the patient's condition is critical or time to treatment is critical (e.g., suspected myocardial infarction or stroke). However, the ultimate decision rests with the aircraft captain, who considers many factors that are not always apparent to the treating physician. This patient has had a cardiac arrest that requires emergency medical treatment as soon as possible, and flight diversion should be recommended.This patient has signs concerning for an acute coronary syndrome (e.g., cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia, jugular venous distension). Although preload optimization is important, especially in an inferior or right-sided infarct, the presence of jugular venous distension could be secondary to heart failure, arguing against the administration of intravenous fluids (Option A). It is difficult to determine the best course of action without an ECG, and flight diversion is the most appropriate management.Oxygen therapy (Option B) is no longer indicated for all patients with acute coronary syndrome. Indications for oxygen therapy in these patients are oxygen saturation less than 94% or signs of respiratory distress; this patient has an oxygen saturation of 96% and no respiratory distress.Sublingual nitroglycerin (Option D) is not indicated because the patient has hypotension and signs suggesting an inferior myocardial infarction. Although sublingual nitroglycerin would be reasonable in the setting of an infarct that is not preload dependent, it could cause further decompensation with an inferior or right-sided infarct as well as with pulmonary embolism. Further testing is necessary before administering nitroglycerin, and flight diversion is the best option.",
