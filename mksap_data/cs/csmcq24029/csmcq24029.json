  "question_text": "A 52-year-old woman is evaluated for a 1-month history of burning pain in the right forefoot radiating toward her toes. She reports that it sometimes feels like she is walking on a pebble. She reports no trauma and no new footwear or activity. Medical history is remarkable for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, and her only medication is metformin.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Pain is elicited with palpation between the distal third and fourth metatarsals of the right foot. No bony abnormalities are present. Sensation is normal.Radiographs of the right foot are normal.",

  "critique": "This patient has a Morton neuroma (interdigital neuralgia) and should be treated with a padded shoe insert (Option D). Morton neuroma is not a true neuroma but fibrosis of an interdigital nerve caused by irritative pressure. It most commonly affects the nerve between the third and fourth metatarsals, although it may present in other interdigital spaces. Patients present with pain and sometimes numbness in the location of the nerve injury, and more than 50% of patients report the sensation of walking on a pebble. Risk factors include the use of tight-fitting shoes and repetitive weightbearing through the forefoot, as in running. The diagnosis is made clinically by history and physical examination, which reveals tenderness in the interdigital space. In neuromas larger than 1 cm, squeezing the metatarsals together may produce a click. Imaging is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis, although ultrasonography or MRI may be used when the diagnosis is unclear. Radiographs are often helpful to exclude other causes of forefoot pain such as fracture. Initial treatment consists of a padded insert situated just proximal to the metatarsal heads to spread the metatarsals, reducing interdigital pressure. Footwear modification to accommodate a wider foot is also recommended. If these measures are ineffective, a local glucocorticoid injection often provides relief. Patients who remain symptomatic after footwear modification and glucocorticoid injections may require interdigital nerve resection. This patient has interdigital burning pain between the distal metatarsals and corresponding tenderness on examination, which strongly suggest Morton neuroma. She should first be treated conservatively with footwear modification, including a padded insert to reduce pressure on the interdigital nerve.Glucocorticoid injection (Option A) using a dorsal approach can be used to treat Morton neuroma; however, it is reserved for patients who do not respond to footwear modification and padding. This patient should be offered conservative therapy before a more invasive approach is pursued.MRI of the right foot (Option B) may be employed to distinguish a Morton neuroma from other forefoot pathology, such as a stress fracture; however, it is not required when the diagnosis is unambiguous. This patient's pain is highly characteristic of a Morton neuroma, and the tenderness is located in the interdigital space rather than on the bone, as would be expected in a stress fracture.A nerve conduction study (Option C) can diagnose and localize disorders of peripheral nerves. The source of this patient's pain, however, is well localized on history and examination, and a nerve conduction study is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Morton neuroma.",
