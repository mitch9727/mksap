        The patient is supine with the hip flexed to 45 degrees and knee flexed to 90 degrees. The examiner sits on the dorsum of the foot and places their hands on the proximal calf and then pulls anteriorly while assessing movement of tibia relative to femur.<i>

        The patient is supine with the leg in slight external rotation and the knee flexed 20-30 degrees at the examiner's side.

        The examiner holds the patient's outstretched hands while the patient stands on one leg with the knee flexed to 5 degrees and the other knee flexed to 90 degrees with the foot off the floor. The patient rotates their body internally and externally three times. The test should be repeated with the knee flexed to 20 degrees. The test should always be performed on the uninvolved knee first.

        With the patient supine, the examiner fully flexes the knee and rotates the tibia externally. The knee is then extended with the hand over the medial joint line. The maneuver is then repeated with the tibia internally rotated and the hand over the lateral joint line.</p><p>
