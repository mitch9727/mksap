  "question_text": "A 52-year-old man is evaluated during a new patient visit. He reports increased fatigue that began insidiously over the past year. He has no chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, or weight loss. He reports restorative sleep and awakens feeling refreshed. His last visit to a physician was 1 year ago, and laboratory studies at that time were normal. He reports no recent illness or social stressors. He does not smoke and rarely drinks alcohol. Medical history is significant for hypertension treated with lisinopril.Physical examination findings, including vital signs and BMI, are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in management of this patient with unexplained fatigue is to obtain a complete blood count (Option A). Fatigue is a subjective symptom, with little to no corroborating objective measures, and can be described as tiredness, exhaustion, reduced endurance, or lack of physical or mental energy. Fatigue may be categorized as acute (<1 month's duration), subacute (1-6 months' duration), or chronic (>6 months' duration). The diagnostic evaluation of fatigue begins with a careful history and physical examination. Clinicians should note the duration of fatigue, preceding factors, concomitant symptoms, lifestyle factors, medication use, sleep patterns, and the presence of red flag signs or symptoms that suggest a serious underlying cause (fever, involuntary weight loss, persistent lymphadenopathy, muscle atrophy, and synovitis). Diagnostic testing choices should be driven by the clinical findings. Obtaining limited laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, fasting glucose level, and kidney and liver chemistry tests, is reasonable. Further testing should be guided by the results of this initial evaluation. This patient has a 1-year history of chronic fatigue that has not been previously evaluated, and obtaining a complete blood count is prudent.Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (Option B) is a measure of chronic inflammation. Although ESR is useful in certain clinical situations, such as evaluation of possible giant cell arteritis, it is nonspecific and unlikely to be helpful in the evaluation of this patient.Polysomnography may be appropriate in a patient presenting with fatigue, depending on the results of initial evaluation. Symptoms suggesting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), such as snoring, overnight awakenings, unrefreshing sleep, or sleep-related choking or gasping, should prompt consideration of polysomnography or home sleep testing. This patient has no findings suggesting OSA, and polysomnography (Option C) is not indicated.Providing reassurance without further testing (Option D) is not an appropriate approach. This patient has symptoms of fatigue that are bothersome and have lasted 1 year, and they should be evaluated.",
