  "question_text": "A 32-year-old patient is evaluated during a new patient visit. They report that they have fainted twice in the past 10 years, including 1 week ago. On both occasions, the patient was in a crowded, stuffy room and experienced a sensation of warmth, diaphoresis, and nausea just before passing out. After awakening, they felt generally weak and fatigued for about 30 minutes before these symptoms resolved spontaneously. They had no other sequalae. Witnesses did not note any abnormal movements during the events. The patient describes no cardiovascular symptoms otherwise and regularly walks up two flights of stairs without symptoms. The patient has no family history of syncope or sudden cardiac death. They have hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.Physical examination findings, including orthostatic vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate test to perform next in this patient with likely neurally mediated (reflex) syncope is ECG (Option B). Neurally mediated syncope is the most common form of syncope and is particularly common in young adults. Neurally mediated syncope includes the following:Vasovagal syncope, which is provoked by noxious stimuli, fear, stress, or heat overexposureSituational syncope, which is triggered by cough, micturition, defecation, or deglutitionCarotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is sometimes experienced during head rotation, shaving, or use of a tight-fitting neck collarProdromal symptoms, including nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diaphoresis, are classically present before the syncopal event, and fatigue, nausea, and generalized weakness are typically present afterward. The diagnosis of neurally mediated syncope can usually be established from the history and physical examination alone. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the evaluation of syncope, however, recommend all adult patients with syncope undergo measurement of orthostatic vital signs and ECG. Although cardiovascular disease is unlikely in many patients with syncope, these are low-barrier tests that may suggest an underlying cause such as prolonged QT syndrome or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This patient's presentation strongly suggests neurally mediated syncope, but they should undergo ECG to assess the possibility of underlying cardiac disease.A cardiac event monitor (Option A) may be a helpful diagnostic step after ECG if arrythmia is suspected as the cause of syncope. Multiple testing options are available depending on the frequency of events (see Table: Diagnostic Testing for Cardiac Arrhythmias). When arrhythmia causes syncope, however, it most commonly presents without a prodrome in patients with known cardiovascular disease. This patient's presentation strongly suggests neurally mediated syncope, and an ECG should be the first test performed.Tilt-table testing (Option C) is reserved for patients with suspected recurrent vasovagal syncope or possible autonomic dysfunction or if the initial evaluation of delayed orthostatic hypotension is not diagnostic. This patient experienced two episodes of likely neurally mediated syncope during the past 10 years, and further evaluation with tilt-table testing is not necessary.No further testing (Option D) would not be the most appropriate diagnostic strategy for this patient. Although the likelihood of a cardiovascular cause of syncope is low, ECG should be obtained in all patients with syncope to identify underlying arrhythmia or QT prolongation.",
