  "question_text": "A 52-year-old woman is evaluated for a 6-month history of difficulty initiating sleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and trouble falling back to sleep. She reports an uncomfortable, crampy feeling in her lower legs that is improved with stretching and moving her legs. This sensation is worse in the evenings and overnight and interferes with her falling asleep. Her husband has not noticed snoring or apneas while she is sleeping. She has no anhedonia, depressed mood, or feelings of anxiety. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and she takes no medications.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management in this patient with symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to measure the serum ferritin level (Option D). RLS is a common movement disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs. Patients report an uncomfortable sensation that is worse at rest and at night and is transiently relieved by movement. RLS may interfere with both sleep onset and sleep maintenance; the resulting insomnia contributes to decreased quality of life and increased risk for depression and suicide. RLS is more common in pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, and in the setting of iron deficiency (possibly related to low intracerebral iron stores). Although extensive laboratory testing is not indicated in the general evaluation of insomnia, measurement of iron stores is helpful in patients with symptoms of RLS. When the serum ferritin level is less than 75 ng/mL (75 µg/L), supplemental iron may be all that is needed to resolve RLS symptoms. The goal of repletion is to increase serum ferritin to greater than 100 ng/mL (100 µg/L). This patient describes an uncomfortable urge to move her legs that is worse in the evenings and at night, consistent with RLS. The first step in her evaluation is measurement of serum ferritin to assess for concomitant iron deficiency.Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (Option A) is the first-line treatment for primary chronic insomnia, underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to a sleep disturbance, such as RLS, should be addressed before initiating this therapy.Melatonin (Option B) is an over-the-counter supplement that may have efficacy in the treatment of circadian rhythm disorders, such as jetlag, but there is no evidence of its benefit for chronic insomnia. It is not an appropriate treatment in this patient with a potentially reversible medical cause of her chronic sleep disturbance.RLS is a clinical diagnosis, and polysomnography (Option C) does not assist in its diagnosis or affect management. RLS may be confused with periodic limb movements of sleep, which are brief, involuntary triple flexion (ankle, knee, hip) movements of the legs that repeat in 20-second cycles during sleep. These movements are not associated with an urge to move and may not disrupt sleep. Polysomnography may help determine whether periodic limb movements cause sleep fragmentation, in which case therapy may be required. Polysomnography would also be indicated if there were suspicion for other sleep-related disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, but features of these disorders, such as snoring or witnessed apneas, are not present in this patient.",
