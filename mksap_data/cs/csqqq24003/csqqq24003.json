  "question_text": "A 79-year-old man is evaluated for dyspnea with ambulation. He recently recovered from an acute COPD exacerbation. He has no increased cough or sputum production, but the dyspnea impedes his quality of life. Medical history is significant for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Medications are olodaterol-tiotropium and albuterol inhalers, valsartan, carvedilol, and empagliflozin.On physical examination, respiration rate is 20/min and oxygen saturation is 90% breathing 1 L/min of oxygen by nasal cannula, which is maintained at 94% during a 6-minute walk test. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient is pulmonary rehabilitation (Option D). In all grades of COPD severity, pulmonary rehabilitation positively affects exercise ability and respiratory symptoms, improving quality of life. It is recommended for all symptomatic patients with an FEV1 less than 50% of predicted. For those hospitalized with an acute COPD exacerbation, participation in pulmonary rehabilitation less than 4 weeks after hospitalization reduces risk of future hospitalization. These programs include education, functional assessment, nutrition counseling, and follow-up to reinforce behavioral techniques for change. They also include an exercise training component that has been shown to improve endurance, flexibility, and upper and lower body strength. Exercise training can provide sustained benefit for postexacerbation symptoms (e.g., breathlessness) following the completion of even a single rehabilitation program. When combined with other forms of therapy (medical therapy, smoking cessation, nutrition counseling, and education), pulmonary rehabilitation decreases patients' perceived intensity of breathlessness, reduces dyspnea and fatigue, facilitates increased participation in daily activities, and enhances health-related quality of life, including improvements in anxiety and depression.This patient has heart failure with preserved ejection fraction but no physical examination findings that suggest volume overload. Thus, initiation of furosemide (Option A) is not indicated at this time.Although this patient has severe dyspnea in the setting of advanced COPD, his oxygen saturation is preserved with 1 L/min oxygen by nasal cannula at rest and during a 6-minute walk test. Additional oxygen therapy (Option B) will not relieve dyspnea or improve clinical outcomes.Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone (Option C), can be an effective treatment in the setting of a COPD exacerbation, which is defined as a sustained worsening of a patient's COPD. Exacerbations are marked by increased breathlessness and are usually accompanied by increased cough and sputum production. This patient has stable chronic dyspnea on exertion and no other findings that would suggest an exacerbation. Therefore, prednisone is not necessary at this time.",

    "Pulmonary rehabilitation can provide significant benefits for patients with chronic lung disease and has been shown to improve subjective dyspnea and reduce risk of future hospitalization in patients with severe COPD and following an acute COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization."
