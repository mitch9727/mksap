  "question_text": "A 46-year-old man is evaluated for a 4-month history of dry, persistent cough. He reports no other associated symptoms and has had no unusual or new environmental exposures. He is a lifelong nonsmoker. He reports no symptoms of acid reflux. Medical history is significant for hypertension, for which he started lisinopril and chlorthalidone 9 months ago.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. No pharyngeal erythema or exudate is noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation. A chest radiograph is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is discontinuation of lisinopril (Option A). Evaluation of patients with chronic cough (cough lasting >8 weeks) begins with history, physical examination, and chest radiography. If the evaluation is unrevealing and the patient is taking an ACE inhibitor, discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor is the first step. When smoking and use of an ACE inhibitor are eliminated, the most common causes are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. Up to 20% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor develop a dry cough. The cough usually subsides within days of discontinuing the offending agent but can sometimes persist for weeks. Rechallenge with an ACE inhibitor will result in return of the cough in two thirds of patients and is not recommended. An angiotensin receptor blocker can be tried because this drug class is associated with a lower incidence of cough. This patient has chronic cough and no symptoms worrisome for a serious disease (e.g., hemoptysis, weight loss) along with a normal chest radiograph, so ACE inhibitor discontinuation is the most appropriate management.If a cause of chronic cough is not determined after initial evaluation, a stepwise approach is pursued, beginning with a 2-week trial of empiric treatment for UACS. UACS related to allergic rhinitis is treated with intranasal glucocorticoids (Option B); UACS caused by nonallergic rhinitis should be treated with first-generation antihistamines and decongestants. This patient has no findings that suggest allergic rhinitis and has not discontinued ACE inhibitor therapy; therefore, an intranasal glucocorticoid should not be initiated.If chronic cough does not respond to empiric treatment for UACS, evaluation for asthma with spirometry (Option C) (or empiric treatment) is warranted. If results of spirometry are negative for asthma, bronchial provocation testing should be pursued.Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (Option D) is indicated when symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are present or when chronic cough persists despite empiric therapy for UACS or empiric treatment for asthma and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis with inhaled glucocorticoids. This patient has no symptoms of reflux, and other management options have not been pursued yet, so initiating a PPI is not indicated.",
