  "question_text": "A 52-year-old woman is evaluated for a 5-week history of left lateral hip pain. She describes the pain as an ache that intermittently radiates down the lateral aspect of the leg. It began insidiously and has gradually worsened. The pain worsens when she climbs stairs or lies on her side. She reports no trauma. She has no leg weakness or swelling.On physical examination, tenderness to palpation is noted over the greater trochanter. Painless full range of motion is present with abduction, flexion, and external rotation of the left hip. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "critique": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS; formerly trochanteric bursitis), and first-line therapy is pain relief with an oral NSAID, such as ibuprofen (Option C); activity modification and physical therapy are also recommended. Patients with GTPS typically have pain localized to the greater trochanter that may radiate down the lateral leg to the knee. The pain is often exacerbated by lying on the affected side and climbing stairs. Pain onset is usually insidious. GTPS can be differentiated from hip joint pain in that GTPS does not usually radiate to the groin or limit hip range of motion. Diagnosis is made by history and by eliciting pain with palpation over the greater trochanter or reproduction of the pain when the patient takes a step up.Glucocorticoid injections (Option A) are generally reserved for patients with GTPS with persistent symptoms and for those who do not respond to an oral NSAID. Because this patient has not yet received any therapy, it would be most appropriate to start with an oral agent such as ibuprofen instead of progressing directly to glucocorticoid injection.Most patients respond to NSAIDs or glucocorticoid injections. Opioid pain medications are typically unnecessary, have a significant risk profile, and do not have a role in the management of GTPS. Therefore, hydrocodone-acetaminophen (Option B) would not be an appropriate management option.GTPS is diagnosed clinically based on a consistent clinical presentation. Plain radiographs are typically normal in patients in whom GTPS is suspected. The role of imaging studies is to evaluate for alternative diagnoses when a GTPS diagnosis is unclear. In this patient, plain radiography of the left hip (Option D) is unnecessary.",
  "key_points": [
    "Patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (formerly trochanteric bursitis) typically have pain localized to the greater trochanter that may radiate down the lateral leg to the knee and pain to palpation over the greater trochanter; treatment includes avoiding painful activities, acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and muscle strengthening."
