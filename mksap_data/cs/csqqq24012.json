  "question_text": "A 51-year-old woman is evaluated for a 10-year history of chronic pain that she describes as head-to-toe aching, twisting, and sometimes burning that involves several large muscle groups. The pain is constant, and she rates the severity as 6 out of 10. She continues to work but is constantly fatigued. She takes oxycodone, which provides minimal relief. She has tried three other opioid medications, gabapentin, and milnacipran; all provided only minimal improvement in her pain. Medical history is also significant for generalized anxiety disorder treated with sertraline.On physical examination, tenderness is noted in multiple large muscle groups.",
  "question_stem": "In addition to slowly tapering oxycodone, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?",

  "critique": "Patients with chronic pain should be referred to a structured physical therapy program (Option B) for evaluation and treatment aimed at improving functional status. This patient has a long-standing history of chronic pain that is consistent with fibromyalgia. Physical therapy teaches patients safe, self-guided exercises to improve functional status, and evidence clearly supports its use in all patients with chronic pain. Guided/progressive physical therapy programs are associated with pain reduction and, perhaps most importantly, functional improvement. No evidence suggests that any specific type of physical therapy is preferred, and programs should be tailored to patient ability and adherence.Mixing opioids and benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam (Option A), should be avoided. Epidemiologic studies indicate that concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may place patients at increased risk for fatal overdose. In three studies of opioid overdose deaths, evidence of concurrent benzodiazepine use was seen in 31% to 61% of persons.Trials of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (Option C) for the treatment of fibromyalgia have yielded inconclusive results. Positive trials of TENS are frequently confounded by concurrent use of an exercise program and massage. Therefore, TENS cannot be recommended for this patient.Opioid rotation strategies, such as switching to transdermal fentanyl (Option D), would not be the most appropriate management of this patient with a long history of chronic pain, particularly in the setting of previous unsuccessful opioid trials. Despite high opioid prescribing rates, no evidence supports the use of long-term opioid therapy in patients with chronic noncancer pain. In one study, patients receiving long-term opioids for chronic pain had more pain, poorer quality of life, and poorer function than a population of patients with chronic pain who were not taking opioids. In this patient with pain that has not improved with opioid therapy, oxycodone should be carefully withdrawn, and nonpharmacologic therapy should be instituted.",
  "key_points": [
    "In patients with chronic noncancer pain, physical therapy reduces pain and improves function.",
    "Evidence is lacking to support chronic opioid therapy in patients with chronic noncancer pain, so continued opioid use should be evaluated at every visit with documentation showing sustained functional improvement owing to effective opioid therapy."
