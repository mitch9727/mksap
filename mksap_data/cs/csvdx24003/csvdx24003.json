Acute proximal biceps tendon rupture often follows a traumatic event and is associated with a \"pop\" and pain, followed by ecchymosis and swelling. Some biceps tendon ruptures may not be preceded by a traumatic event but instead occur gradually. Swelling of the biceps belly, known as Popeye sign, may appear. The Popeye sign may not be noticed in patients with reduced muscle mass or obesity.",
