The radiograph of this patient's left shoulder shows evidence of degenerative changes of the left acromioclavicular joint consistent with acromioclavicular arthritis. As a synovial joint, the acromioclavicular joint may show the typical findings of osteoarthritis, including joint-space narrowing (solid arrow), subchondral sclerosis (dashed arrow), and osteophyte formation, as seen in this patient (left panel). A comparison of a normal acromioclavicular joint (right panel) is shown.",
