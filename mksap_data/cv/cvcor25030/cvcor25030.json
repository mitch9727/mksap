  "question_text": "A 29-year-old woman is evaluated for a heart murmur. She is asymptomatic and has no exercise limitations. She has no medical conditions and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. A grade 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur is heard at the left sternal border. The remainder of the examination is normal.Echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation, and a normal left ventricular end-systolic dimension. The ascending aorta is mildly enlarged, with a dimension of 4.2 cm.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management in this patient with a bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic root dilation is serial surveillance echocardiography (Option C). Bicuspid aortic valve disease, which affects 1% to 2% of the general population, leads to abnormal shear forces and predisposes to early degeneration of the valve, resulting in stenosis or, rarely, pure regurgitation. Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve typically present with an asymptomatic murmur in adolescence or young adulthood and may gradually progress to severe valvular disease in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Independent of the severity of aortic stenosis or regurgitation, bicuspid valvulopathy is often accompanied by aortic abnormalities, including aortic aneurysm, dissection, or coarctation. Therefore, patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease should be examined for aortopathy with transthoracic echocardiography, or with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or CT angiography if echocardiographic assessment is suboptimal. Lifelong serial imaging is indicated if aortic abnormalities are detected. The imaging modality and frequency depend on the nature and severity of the abnormality, age of the patient, family history, and candidacy for surgery. This healthy young patient with bicuspid aortopathy should undergo repeat echocardiography for surveillance.No antihypertensive therapies slow aortic dilatation in patients with bicuspid aortopathy. Angiotensin receptor blockers, such as losartan (Option A), slow the rate of progressive aortic root dilation in patients with Marfan aortopathy, even in the absence of hypertension. However, they are not effective in bicuspid aortopathy and are not recommended in this normotensive patient.Management of bicuspid aortic valve disease is determined by the predominant lesion type (stenosis or regurgitation) and its severity. In patients undergoing surgery for severe valvular disease, surgical repair of the ascending aorta (Option B) is advised when the aortic diameter is greater than 4.5 cm. In the absence of other surgical indications, aortic repair is advised when the diameter is greater than 5.5 cm or greater than 5.0 cm in a patient with additional risk factors for dissection (family history, rapid rate of progression). This asymptomatic patient with an aortic diameter of 4.2 cm does not currently have an indication for surgical intervention.Patients with bicuspid aortopathy are at risk for progressive aortic root dilatation and dissection. Therefore, active surveillance is required even in this asymptomatic patient, and providing no further management (Option D) would be incorrect.",

    "Management of bicuspid aortic valve disease is according to the predominant valve lesion type (aortic stenosis or regurgitation) and its severity.",
    "Because bicuspid aortopathy may progress in severity, lifelong surveillance imaging is recommended for patients with a bicuspid valve and aortic abnormalities."
