One year ago, she had an ischemic stroke with no residual neurologic effects. She also has hypertension. Current medications are lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin.On physical examination, blood pressure is 102/70 mm Hg and pulse rate is 45/min. All other findings are unremarkable.The initial high-sensitivity troponin level is normal (<99th percentile upper reference limit).ECG is shown.",

  "critique": "Additional ECG testing with modified leads (Option A) is indicated in this patient with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In patients with suspected ACS but with initial test results nondiagnostic of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), serial ECGs and, in some cases, ECG with modified leads are indicated to identify evolving STEMI. ECGs should be repeated every 15 to 30 minutes as necessary to clarify the diagnosis and determine the need for reperfusion therapy. In patients with possible posterior myocardial infarction, modified posterior leads V7, V8, and/or V9 should be assessed for ST-segment elevation. This patient has symptoms suggesting ACS and an initial ECG with significant precordial ST-segment depression with accompanying tall R waves and nondiagnostic ST-segment elevation isolated to lead III, suggestive of a posterior myocardial infarction. The recognition of 1 mm ST-segment elevation in leads V7 and V8 (shown) is diagnostic of posterior myocardial infarction and indicates the need for immediate reperfusion therapy.Early reperfusion with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy (Option B) is indicated in all patients with STEMI in the absence of active contraindication. PCI is preferable to thrombolysis unless it cannot be performed within 120 minutes of first medical contact. This patient does not have an indication for reperfusion at presentation and has a relative contraindication to thrombolytic therapy (history of ischemic stroke). Greater clarity is needed before initiation of reperfusion therapy.Serial troponin levels (Option C) are a component of the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk scores, which can guide treatment in patients with non–ST-elevation ACS, including the timing of coronary angiography. In patients with a high likelihood of ACS and symptomatic, hemodynamic, or electrical instability, but without ST-segment elevation on ECG, urgent coronary angiography is appropriate within 2 hours of presentation. In this patient, however, posterior myocardial infarction due to coronary artery occlusion has not been excluded and serial and modified lead ECGs are necessary to further assess the possibility of STEMI, which would be best treated with immediate reperfusion with primary PCI or thrombolytic therapy.Temporary pacemaker implantation (Option D) may be considered in patients with ACS and symptomatic bradycardia due to persistent or progressive high-degree atrioventricular block. Hemodynamically stable, vagally mediated bradyarrhythmias, such as the sinus bradycardia seen in this patient, do not require specific intervention.",
