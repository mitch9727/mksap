  "critique": "The most appropriate management is to continue treatment of the underlying severe sepsis without specific cardiovascular intervention (Option D). Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a spectrum of acute ischemic disorders that include ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non–ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), and unstable angina, all of which result from an imbalance between myocardial blood supply and demand (see ). Pathophysiologic mechanisms in NSTE-ACS include an atherothrombotic event secondary to plaque erosion or rupture (type 1) and coronary blood flow supply-demand mismatch secondary to nonthrombotic causes, such as noncardiac hypotension, severe anemia, and atrial arrhythmia with rapid ventricular rate (type 2). In type 1 events, evaluation and treatment are centered on the underlying coronary obstruction, whereas type 2 events are managed by optimizing myocardial perfusion through treatment of the underlying cause. Patients with type 2 events often have underlying coronary artery disease (CAD), but the CAD is not the primary issue. This patient has several cardiac risk factors and a high likelihood of CAD, with evidence of myocardial injury as indicated by elevated troponin levels; however, the lack of objective evidence of ischemia (ischemic chest discomfort, ST-segment changes or Q-waves on ECG, or imaging evidence of myocardial ischemia) is not consistent with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. This patient's presentation, including an ECG with nonspecific findings and underlying sepsis, instead suggests acute myocardial injury (significant rise and/or fall of troponin levels). The focus of initial management should be on the underlying condition, in this case, sepsis.Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor; Option A) is warranted in many patients with ACS, including ACS secondary to plaque rupture, such as ST-elevation ACS (STE-ACS) and type 1 NSTE-ACS. It is not likely to be helpful in a patient with acute myocardial injury, such as this patient.Although the eventual evaluation of possible CAD may include coronary angiography, the focus for this patient should be on treating the underlying condition. This patient has no indication, such as STE-ACS or high-risk NSTE-ACS, for urgent angiography (Option B). It would be inappropriate to perform emergent coronary arteriography while the patient requires urgent management of severe sepsis.Although oral β-blockade (Option C) is a key aspect of therapy in ACS, as well as for some patients with chronic CAD, it is contraindicated in the setting of relative hypotension and hypoperfusion.",

He has hypertension, dyslipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications are lisinopril, atorvastatin, tamsulosin, and metformin.On physical examination, temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), blood pressure is 97/56 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 118/min. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.ECG findings are shown.Blood and urine cultures are obtained, and intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered, resulting in hemodynamic improvement.",
