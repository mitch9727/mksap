  "question_text": "A 63-year-old man is seen in follow-up of coronary artery disease. He initially presented with exertional chest discomfort that occurred while walking up hills on his daily walk. He underwent CT angiography, which revealed 70% stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery; no significant disease was present in the other coronary arteries. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function. He began treatment with aspirin, rosuvastatin, and metoprolol. He now reports resolution of the exertional angina, including while walking up hills. He has no other medical problems and takes no other medications.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management in this patient with coronary artery disease (CAD) is to continue current medical therapy (Option D). All patients with CAD should receive guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) comprising risk factor modification, cardioprotective medications to prevent thrombosis and limit progression, and antianginal medications to improve functional capacity. Optimization of medical therapy is essential, regardless of whether revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is being considered in stable syndromes. The primary goals of revascularization in stable CAD are to lessen angina and improve quality of life. PCI is not superior to GDMT in patients with stable angina without high-risk anatomic features. Similarly, CABG improves survival only in select patients, including those with left main or three-vessel CAD and patients with diabetes and multivessel disease. This patient has stable angina secondary to nonproximal single-vessel disease that has been relieved with medical therapy. Neither PCI nor CABG would be beneficial, and the patient should continue with GDMT.Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (Option A) in CAD is used to assess the viability of myocardium and the degree of infarction as well as for stress testing with dobutamine or vasodilators. There are no questions regarding myocardial viability or the need for stress testing in this patient, and CMR imaging is not indicated.CABG (Option B) is indicated in patients for whom it would improve survival, specifically those with left main or three-vessel CAD and those with multivessel disease and diabetes. CABG also improves 10-year survival compared with medical therapy alone in patients who have multivessel disease with severe left ventricular dysfunction. This patient meets none of those criteria.PCI (Option C) is used to relieve symptoms in patients with medically refractory angina, those unable to tolerate optimal medical therapy, and those with high-risk features on noninvasive testing. PCI has not been shown to be superior to GDMT in reducing the risk for myocardial infarction or sudden death in patients with stable angina and no high-risk anatomic features, including this patient with nonproximal, single-vessel disease.",

    "In stable CAD, percutaneous coronary intervention is not superior to medical therapy in reducing the risk for myocardial infarction or sudden death; indications include failure of medical therapy and high-risk features on noninvasive testing."
