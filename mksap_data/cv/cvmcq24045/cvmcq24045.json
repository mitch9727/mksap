  "question_text": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss plans for pregnancy. She has a history of mitral valve prolapse and has occasional palpitations that are not associated with other symptoms. She works 8 hours a day cleaning houses and has had no change in exercise tolerance, chest pain, or other symptoms. She has no family history of cardiovascular disease, and she takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Central venous pressure is not elevated. Occasional ectopic beats are detected on auscultation. The S2 is of normal intensity and splits with normal respiratory variation; there is no murmur. No peripheral edema is present.Laboratory results, including thyroid-stimulating hormone level, are normal.ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with two premature atrial contractions. Echocardiogram shows a myxomatous mitral valve with mild valve prolapse, mild mitral regurgitation, and normal chamber size and function.",

  "critique": "No further evaluation or therapy (Option D) is indicated before pregnancy. All women with cardiovascular disease should receive pregnancy counseling before conception. Patients with many cardiovascular disorders, including uncomplicated small patent ductus arteriosus, mild pulmonary stenosis, and successfully repaired simple congenital lesions, have no increased morbidity or mortality associated with pregnancy. Similarly, patients with asymptomatic and mild mitral valve prolapse (MVP) with mild mitral regurgitation are at low risk for complications during pregnancy, and no further cardiac evaluation is indicated in these patients. Symptomatic palpitations and premature atrial contractions (PACs) are common with MVP and do not necessarily indicate more significant cardiac disease. During pregnancy, atrial ectopy may increase and palpitations may occur more frequently, but this is not a contraindication to pregnancy, and further workup is unlikely to change the risk stratification. This patient has MVP with mild mitral regurgitation with symptomatic PACs but an excellent exercise tolerance and normal echocardiogram other than the MVP. She does not require further testing or risk stratification before pregnancy.An event monitor (Option A) can be useful in determining the cause of a patient's palpitations, but this patient's PACs were readily identified on ECG. An event monitor would not add further information or aid in risk stratification before pregnancy.Exercise testing (Option B) may help risk stratify patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease who wish to become pregnant and are uncertain about their risks. This patient is already known to be at low risk for cardiovascular complications in pregnancy, and stress testing is unlikely to provide further information to guide management.β-Blockers such as metoprolol succinate (Option C) may be helpful in treating symptomatic PACs; however, this patient wishes to become pregnant, and β-blockers could potentially affect the fetus. In patients in whom the benefit outweighs the risk, certain β-blockers may be used during pregnancy, but in this situation, the risk of untreated PACs is low and drug therapy is unnecessary.",
