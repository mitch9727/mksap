  "question_text": "A 71-year-old man is evaluated after treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia. He has a 53-year cigarette smoking history but quit 2 years ago. He has dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications are atorvastatin, aspirin, ramipril, metformin, and semaglutide.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. There are 1+ pulses in the left femoral artery, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries. He has ischemic ulceration of the left foot and a 3- × 4-cm shallow ulceration on the left first toe. Ankle-brachial index is 0.52 in the left leg.CT angiography shows a long-segment superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery occlusion with severe calcification. Reconstitution of the distal popliteal artery is present.The patient undergoes femoral-popliteal bypass surgery with available vein conduit and debridement of the left foot ulcer.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step is rivaroxaban initiation (Option B). The most important treatment for patients with limb-threatening ischemia is urgent surgical or endovascular limb revascularization. After revascularization, patients should undergo aggressive risk factor modification and antithrombotic therapy. Antiplatelet therapy is mandatory in all patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD); current guidelines recommend antiplatelet monotherapy in patients with PAD to reduce risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial events. Consideration also should be given to combining antiplatelet therapy with rivaroxaban. After surgical or endovascular revascularization, the combination of low-dose aspirin and low-dose rivaroxaban has been shown to be effective in reducing the occurrence of a composite end point (acute limb ischemia, major amputation, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular death) compared with low-dose aspirin alone. This patient has undergone surgical revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Adding rivaroxaban to low-dose aspirin is indicated to decrease the risk for recurrent events.The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Option A) is not indicated in this patient who recently had successful surgical revascularization. Its use should be reserved for patients with poorly healing ulceration after revascularization or those with no other treatment options.Oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin is no more effective than antiplatelet monotherapy in patients with PAD but is associated with an increased risk for major bleeding, including intracerebral bleeding. Warfarin initiation (Option C) would not be appropriate in this patient.No change in medical therapy (Option D) would be an inappropriate choice in this patient with PAD. Although antiplatelet therapy is indicated, the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin is superior to aspirin monotherapy in patients after peripheral arterial revascularization and would be the preferred option in this patient without a clearly increased bleeding risk.",
