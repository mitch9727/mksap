  "question_text": "A 58-year-old woman is evaluated during a routine follow-up. She recently had carotid artery ultrasonography as part of a “wellness package” at a local imaging center, which revealed carotid artery stenosis. She has no symptoms. Other than gardening, she is relatively sedentary. She has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Medications are aspirin, chlorthalidone, valsartan, and high-intensity atorvastatin.On physical examination, blood pressure is 126/70 mm Hg and pulse rate is 70/min and regular.Laboratory studies:LDL cholesterol68 mg/dL (1.76 mmol/L)The carotid ultrasound report shows moderate heterogeneous plaque in both internal carotid arteries with less than 50% stenosis bilaterally.",

  "critique": "This patient should continue her current treatment (Option E). Treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) entails aggressive risk factor modification and treatment of specific disease (e.g., coronary artery disease [CAD]) as indicated. Smoking cessation and treatment of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, if present, are cornerstones of therapy. Statin therapy is indicated in patients with ASCVD with a goal LDL cholesterol of below 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L). Antiplatelet therapy is also indicated in most patients. This patient with newly diagnosed carotid artery stenosis has well-controlled hypertension, is taking aspirin, and has an LDL cholesterol level below 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L); she should continue her current medical therapy.There is no indication for stress testing for CAD (Option A) in patients with cerebrovascular disease but no symptoms to suggest CAD.Bempedoic acid (Option B) is not indicated in this patient. The use of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents such as bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and evolocumab should be considered in patients who are intolerant of statin medications or who cannot achieve recommended LDL cholesterol levels on high-dose statin therapy. This patient has achieved the goal LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), and no additive treatment is necessary.Patients with ASCVD benefit from antiplatelet therapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), however, should be reserved for patients with high-risk conditions, such as after coronary artery stent placement or in the immediate period after a minor stroke. Starting DAPT by adding clopidogrel (Option C) in this asymptomatic patient is likely to lead to a higher hazard of bleeding without clear benefit.This patient's carotid duplex ultrasound demonstrates mild stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally, but further imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (Option D) is not indicated. MRA or CT angiography for carotid stenosis may be indicated before planned endarterectomy or if ultrasound results are not definitive, but neither is the case in this patient who has no symptoms and low-grade stenosis.",
