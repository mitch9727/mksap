  "question_text": "A 58-year-old woman is evaluated for daily heart palpitations. She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, or presyncope, but she finds the palpitations uncomfortable. Medical history is significant for hypertension and sleep apnea. Her only medication is lisinopril.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Cardiac examination detects occasional ectopy.Results of routine laboratory studies, including thyroid-stimulating hormone level, are within normal ranges.ECG shows sinus rhythm and is otherwise normal. Forty-eight–hour ambulatory ECG monitoring shows occasional premature atrial contractions (~5%) and 10 runs of atrial tachycardia (longest, 10 beats; fastest, 150/min) that correlate with symptoms of palpitations. Transthoracic echocardiogram is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management in this patient with symptomatic premature atrial contractions (PACs) and atrial tachycardia is to switch lisinopril to metoprolol (Option C). PACs and atrial tachycardia are forms of atrial ectopy. PACs are early isolated beats that arise from the atria and are exceedingly common, being present in 99% of individuals on ambulatory ECG monitoring. Atrial tachycardia represents a regular tachycardia emanating from an atrial source outside the sinoatrial node. It occurs in the presence or absence of structural heart disease. Both PACs and atrial tachycardia are usually well tolerated but can cause symptoms, especially palpitations. Both symptomatic PACs and symptomatic atrial tachycardia are typically treated with β-blockers or calcium channel blockers. This patient has symptomatic atrial ectopy with PACs and brief atrial tachycardia, which are probably related to her age, hypertension, and sleep apnea. Because of her symptoms, it is reasonable to treat her with an atrioventricular node blocker such as metoprolol.This patient does not have atrial fibrillation, and although a high PAC burden is associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation (Option A) is not indicated for PACs or atrial tachycardia.Catheter ablation (Option B) for atrial tachycardia may be highly effective, particularly for persistent arrhythmia that occurs throughout the day and is refractory to medical therapy. Medical therapy has not failed in this patient, and because she has a relatively low burden of ectopy and arrhythmia, mapping and ablation may be difficult because it is unlikely that the arrhythmia will be present frequently enough during the procedure for mapping to occur.This patient is having uncomfortable symptoms from her arrhythmia; therefore, making no changes to therapy (Option D) is not appropriate. Some patients with arrhythmia have minimal symptoms and may decide to forgo medical therapy, which is also a reasonable approach.",
