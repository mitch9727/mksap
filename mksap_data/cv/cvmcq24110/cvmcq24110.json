  "question_text": "A 62-year-old man is evaluated for recurrent dyspnea. He has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction 40%) after myocardial infarction 6 months ago. The paroxysmal AF was initially rhythm controlled with amiodarone, but amiodarone was discontinued 6 weeks ago because of concerns regarding long-term administration. He was hospitalized 3 weeks ago with an exacerbation of heart failure associated with AF with rapid ventricular response. He then did well until presenting now with worsening dyspnea. He denies palpitations, light-headedness, or chest pain. Medications are clopidogrel, metoprolol, apixaban, atorvastatin, dapagliflozin, spironolactone, lisinopril, and furosemide.On physical examination, blood pressure is 119/65 mm Hg, pulse rate is 119/min, and respiration rate is 25/min. Central venous pressure is elevated. Cardiac examination reveals irregular tachycardia without murmur. Lower extremity edema is noted.ECG reveals atrial fibrillation and anterior Q waves.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment in this patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure is catheter ablation (Option B). AF complicates nearly 40% of cases of heart failure, and the combination of AF and heart failure drastically worsens outcomes; aggressive efforts to achieve rhythm control in patients with AF and concomitant heart failure may decrease morbidity and mortality. Efforts at rhythm control may be particularly helpful when heart failure exacerbations are being driven by concomitant AF. In addition, in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), catheter ablation of AF is associated with a favorable effect on outcomes compared with medical therapy. This patient has HFrEF in the setting of uncontrolled AF. There is also the suggestion that his heart failure was less severe when his AF was controlled on amiodarone. As a result, pursuing a rhythm control strategy with catheter ablation is appropriate in this patient.Flecainide (Option A) has efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF. It is a reasonable choice in patients with a structurally normal heart but is contraindicated in those with ischemic or structural heart disease.This patient does not meet the criteria for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement (Option C). ICD placement in ischemic heart failure for primary prevention is indicated for an ejection fraction (EF) less than 30%. In addition, his reduced EF may be reversibly exacerbated by AF. Although a dual-chamber device has the advantage of atrial pacing, he does not have an indication for pacing.Sotalol (Option D) is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can achieve effective rhythm control of AF. However, it is contraindicated among persons with impaired left ventricular function, such as this patient.",

    "Amiodarone may be useful in rhythm control for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but long-term therapy should be avoided in young patients because of significant risk for toxicity."
