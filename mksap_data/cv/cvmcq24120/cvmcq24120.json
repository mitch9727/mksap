  "question_text": "A 73-year-old man is evaluated for worsening shortness of breath and lower extremity edema of 6 weeks' duration. He has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%. Medical history is also notable for coronary artery disease, permanent atrial fibrillation, and placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Medications are valsartan-sacubitril, empagliflozin, spironolactone, metoprolol succinate, furosemide, rosuvastatin, and rivaroxaban.On physical examination, blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg and heart rate is 60/min and irregularly irregular. Central venous pressure is elevated. A holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. Crackles are present at both lung bases.ECG is notable for atrial fibrillation and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities; QRS duration is 112 ms. Transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a diastolic ventricular diameter of 6.9 cm and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with posteriorly directed severe mitral regurgitation. There is mitral annular dilation with no mitral leaflet abnormalities.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step for this patient with severe secondary (functional) mitral regurgitation is percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve repair with a clip device (transcatheter edge-to-edge repair [TEER]) (Option C). Chronic mitral regurgitation is classified as secondary when caused by issues external to the valve annulus, most commonly ventricular dysfunction. In patients with chronic secondary mitral regurgitation, the primary therapy focuses on the ventricular dysfunction with guideline-directed medical therapy and, if indicated, cardiac resynchronization therapy. The benefits of surgical valve repair or replacement in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation are uncertain. TEER, however, is an option in patients with refractory symptoms despite optimal heart failure therapy based on the COAPT trial, which demonstrated a reduction in mortality and heart failure hospitalization independent of the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation. This patient's echocardiogram demonstrates severe mitral regurgitation caused by annular dilation without mitral leaflet abnormalities, consistent with secondary mitral regurgitation. He remains symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy, and because he has a left ventricular ejection fraction between 20% and 50% with a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter less than 7 cm, he meets criteria for consideration of percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve repair with the clip device.Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (Option A) may be pursued in the evaluation of mitral regurgitation if echocardiography is insufficient to determine the exact severity or the mechanism of the valve disease. However, the severity and mechanism of mitral regurgitation in this patient are clear and CMR would not provide additional useful information.Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) (Option B) may reduce mitral regurgitation and should be considered before TEER if indicated for underlying heart failure. CRT may be indicated in heart failure with left bundle branch block or if a QRS complex of 150 ms or greater is present. This patient has a normal QRS duration, so CRT is not indicated.Unlike percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve repair, no prospective randomized trial evidence supports use of surgical mitral valve repair (Option D) in secondary mitral regurgitation. It is not considered first-line therapy for this condition, regardless of surgical risk.",
