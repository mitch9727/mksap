  "question_text": "A 65-year-old man is evaluated during routine follow-up. He is asymptomatic. He has aortic regurgitation that has been monitored with serial echocardiography. Medical history is significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Medications are lisinopril and atorvastatin.On physical examination, blood pressure is 128/45 mm Hg and pulse rate is 70/min. Cardiac examination reveals prominent carotid and radial pulses bilaterally, a soft systolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border, and a holodiastolic murmur heard at the left sternal border.Transthoracic echocardiogram shows a dilated left ventricle (left ventricular end systolic diameter [LVESD] of 54 mm), an ejection fraction of 58%, severe aortic regurgitation, and a normal aortic root. Previous echocardiogram showed an LVESD of 48 mm.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with severe aortic regurgitation and a dilated left ventricle is aortic valve replacement (Option A). In chronic aortic regurgitation, surgical aortic valve replacement is advised for patients with symptoms (typically dyspnea or angina) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤55%) thought to be caused by aortic regurgitation. It is also recommended for patients with severe aortic regurgitation who are undergoing other cardiac surgery. In addition, surgical treatment is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and normal LV function with significant LV dilatation (LV end systolic diameter >50 mm or indexed end-systolic dimension >25 mm/m2). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is not currently indicated for aortic regurgitation. The patient's physical examination findings, including the wide pulse pressure and prominent pulses, are consistent with severe aortic regurgitation, which is confirmed on echocardiography. Although this patient is asymptomatic and has normal LV function, the left ventricle has dilated since the last echocardiogram to greater than 50 mm, meeting the criteria for surgical replacement. He should undergo aortic valve replacement.Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (Option B) can quantitatively assess the severity of aortic regurgitation, assess the aorta for aneurysmal dilation, and assess ventricular function and dimensions. In this patient, however, echocardiography has provided the necessary information, and CMR imaging is not necessary.Patients with chronic aortic regurgitation and concomitant hypertension should undergo medical therapy, preferably with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers, but this does not obviate the need for surgery when indicated. This patient with a dilated left ventricle should undergo surgery; increasing the lisinopril dosage (Option C) is not the most appropriate next step.Monitoring of valve and LV status with clinical evaluation and echocardiography every 6 to 12 months (Option D) is an appropriate strategy in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and a nondilated and normally functioning left ventricle. This patient, however, has a dilated left ventricle and should undergo surgery.",
