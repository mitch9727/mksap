  "question_text": "An 84-year-old man is evaluated for new-onset lower extremity edema and exertional shortness of breath. Symptoms have been progressive during the past 3 weeks. He has permanent atrial fibrillation and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Eight years ago, he underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery and placement of a transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the setting of a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. Medications include apixaban, atorvastatin, metoprolol, valsartan-sacubitril, furosemide, spironolactone, and empagliflozin.On physical examination, blood pressure is 125/74 mm Hg and pulse rate is 60/min. Oxygen saturation is 95% breathing ambient air. Jugular venous pulsations appear to be elevated to the mandible of the jaw, with a prominent c-v wave. The lungs are clear. Cardiac examination reveals an irregular rhythm and systolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border with respiratory variation. There is 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.Echocardiogram shows an LVEF of 35%, a mildly enlarged right ventricle, and severe tricuspid regurgitation, with an ICD lead passing through the tricuspid valve. Right ventricular systolic pressure is estimated at 31 mm Hg.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management in this patient with symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation is to intensify diuretic therapy (Option A). Tricuspid regurgitation may be caused by problems inherent to the valve apparatus, such as congenital abnormalities and infective endocarditis, or by secondary causes, including right ventricular failure due to pulmonary hypertension or left heart failure with resultant dilation of the tricuspid annulus. Transvalvular cardiac device lead placement may also cause tricuspid regurgitation due to tethering of valve leaflets. First-line therapy for secondary tricuspid regurgitation is treatment of the underlying disease and diuretic therapy with loop diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This patient's tricuspid regurgitation is probably the result of a combination of left-sided heart failure and tricuspid leaflet tethering due to the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead running across the valve. Intensification of the previously prescribed furosemide and spironolactone therapy is indicated.Among patients with an ICD in whom secondary tricuspid regurgitation develops, diuresis remains first-line treatment. Even in severe tricuspid insufficiency that persists despite diuretic therapy, ICD removal may be risky because the valve may be irreversibly damaged and myocardial or vascular damage may occur if older leads are removed. In addition, this patient still has an indication for an ICD for primary prevention of arrhythmia, and removal (Option B) would not be advisable.Right heart catheterization (Option C) can help establish intracardiac pressures and confirm the diagnosis of severe tricuspid regurgitation. In this case, however, the patient's examination findings and symptoms are consistent with severe tricuspid regurgitation, and no further testing is needed to confirm severity.In patients with secondary tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid valve replacement (Option D) should be reserved for those whose symptoms are refractory to medical therapy with diuretics. A trial of more intense therapy with diuretics is the next best step in this patient.",
  "key_points": [
    "In patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to left heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or cardiac device lead, diuretic therapy is first-line treatment.",
    "In tricuspid insufficiency related to cardiac device leads, device removal may be ineffective because the tricuspid valve may be irreversibly damaged and risk outweighs benefit."
