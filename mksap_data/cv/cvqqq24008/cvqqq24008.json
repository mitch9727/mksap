  "question_text": "A 69-year-old man is evaluated during a follow-up visit for exertional chest pressure. He initially presented 3 months ago. Despite maximal medical therapy, his symptoms continue to adversely affect his quality of life. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Medications are low-dose aspirin; metformin; long-acting nitroglycerin; and optimal doses of metoprolol, lisinopril, ranolazine, and atorvastatin.On physical examination, blood pressure is 128/73 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 60/min. Examination is normal.Coronary angiogram is significant for a normal left main coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery resulting from ulcerated plaque.",

  "critique": "This patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and single-vessel coronary artery disease should undergo revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (Option C). PCI is not superior to optimal medical therapy in patients with stable angina for reducing cardiovascular events, such as mortality and myocardial infarction. However, PCI is associated with improved quality of life by reducing the severity and frequency of angina. Guidelines recommend that diagnostic angiography and PCI be reserved for patients who are receiving optimal medical therapy and have refractory symptoms, those who are unable to tolerate optimal medical therapy owing to adverse effects, and those with high-risk features on noninvasive exercise and imaging tests. This patient has 90% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery and refractory symptoms; therefore, PCI is a reasonable therapeutic option.The use of supplements such as β-carotene (Option A), selenium, chromium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and estrogen has not been associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes or symptom relief and is not recommended in patients with ischemic heart disease.Cardiac rehabilitation (Option B) may be appropriate after revascularization occurs; however, this patient should first undergo revascularization with PCI to treat his significant angina symptoms.Aspirin is associated with a decreased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with coronary artery disease. Aspirin doses of 81 mg to 162 mg daily are recommended in all patients with established coronary artery disease unless contraindicated. In patients allergic to aspirin, clopidogrel is recommended as an alternative. The use of newer antiplatelet agents (prasugrel, ticagrelor) (Option D) as monotherapy has not been tested in patients with stable angina. Dual antiplatelet therapy for chronic angina in the absence of stent placement is not recommended.",
