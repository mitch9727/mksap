  "question_text": "A 78-year-old man is evaluated in the hospital for four episodes of chest pain at rest in the past 24 hours. Medical history is significant for dyslipidemia, hypertension, tobacco use, and previous transient ischemic attack. Medications are aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and ramipril.On physical examination, blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg and pulse rate is 103/min. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.Laboratory studies are notable for normal serum high-sensitivity troponin levels; serum creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL (97.2 µmol/L).An ECG demonstrates 2-mm ST-segment depressions in leads V4 through V6.Metoprolol, nitrates, clopidogrel, and heparin are initiated.",

  "critique": "This patient should undergo urgent coronary angiography (Option D). Patients with a non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) should undergo risk stratification before invasive treatment because the link between revascularization and clinical outcomes is less clear in these patients than in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Risk stratification tools, such as the TIMI and GRACE risk scores, can be used to determine which patients with NSTE-ACS should be treated with an invasive strategy versus an ischemia-guided approach. An early invasive strategy benefits patients with high TIMI risk scores (5-7) and intermediate TIMI risk scores (3-4) as well as those with GRACE scores greater than 140. This patient has a TIMI risk score of 5, as indicated by the presence of three traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease: aspirin use within the last week, age older than 65 years, two or more angina episodes in the past 24 hours, and significant ST-segment deviation on ECG. The GRACE score is 141. These scores place him at high risk for death and cardiac ischemic events, and despite the absence of elevated cardiac biomarker levels, urgent (within 24 hours) coronary angiography is warranted. Patients with intermediate TIMI risk scores or GRACE scores of 109 to 140 should undergo delayed (within 72 hours) coronary angiography.Stress testing with adenosine nuclear stress testing (Option A) or exercise stress ECG could be considered for purposes of risk stratification if this patient declines an early invasive strategy. However, an invasive strategy improves mortality outcomes, recurrent myocardial infarction, and repeat hospitalization compared with an ischemia-guided approach in patients with NSTE-ACS.Thrombolytic therapy, such as alteplase (Option B), has no benefit in patients with NSTE-ACS and is not recommended.In patients with suspected NSTE-ACS with a normal initial serum troponin level and inconclusive ECG findings, further diagnostic studies may be indicated. Coronary CT angiography (Option C) is appropriate, and rest single-photon emission CT may be appropriate. However, in this patient, coronary CT angiography would only delay critical therapy.",
