  "question_text": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the office to establish primary care. She has no significant medical history and takes no medications. She has no known medication allergies.On physical examination, cardiac auscultation reveals a high-pitched midsystolic click and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur loudest at the apex.An echocardiogram shows moderate mitral regurgitation and myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and chamber size.After discussing the echocardiographic findings, the patient asks about the need for antibiotic prophylaxis before an upcoming dental procedure.",

  "critique": "No antimicrobial therapy is indicated for this patient before dental procedures (Option D). Patients such as this one with mitral regurgitation owing to myxomatous degeneration (mitral valve prolapse) do not require antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. Although endocarditis prophylaxis was previously advised for a broad population, current guidelines recommend its use for a specific group of patients before dental procedures involving manipulation of the gingival tissue or periapical regions of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated for patients with any of the following:History of endocarditisCardiac transplantation with valve regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valveProsthetic valve, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homograftsCardiac valve repair using prosthetic material, including annuloplasty rings, chords, and clipsLeft ventricular assist deviceUnrepaired cyanotic congenital heart diseaseRepaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or deviceCongenital heart defect repaired with prosthetic material (surgical or catheter based) within the previous 6 monthsThis patient should be reassured that her condition is not high risk for infective endocarditis, and antimicrobial prophylaxis would not be beneficial before dental procedures.Oral amoxicillin (Option A), 2 g, taken 30 to 60 minutes before a dental procedure is the management of choice in patients for whom prophylaxis is indicated. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated for this patient with mitral regurgitation caused by mitral valve prolapse.In patients requiring antimicrobial prophylaxis, azithromycin (Option B), clarithromycin, or doxycycline are recommended alternatives for those with severe penicillin allergy, which includes a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or urticaria with use of penicillin or ampicillin. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated for this patient.Cephalexin (Option C) or another first- or second-generation oral cephalosporin is recommended for individuals with a history of non-severe penicillin allergy. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated for this patient.",
