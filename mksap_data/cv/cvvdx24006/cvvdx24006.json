  "critique": "This ECG demonstrates atrial flutter (Option B), which is characterized by a sawtooth pattern and a regular atrial rate often close to 300/min. Flutter waves are most easily seen in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). Most commonly, there is 2:1 conduction to the ventricles, resulting in a ventricular rate of approximately 150/min, as seen in the first part of this tracing. A 4:1 conduction pattern with a rate of 75/min is also seen later in the tracing. The change in conduction pattern results in an irregular rhythm.",
