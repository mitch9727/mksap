  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy (Option B), such as cardiac amyloidosis. This ECG demonstrates low voltage with QRS amplitude of less than 5 mm in the limb leads. Low voltage also may be demonstrated by a QRS amplitude of less than 10 mm in the precordial leads. When low ECG voltage accompanies increased wall thickness on echocardiogram, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as amyloidosis, should be considered. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an appropriate next test when cardiac amyloidosis is suspected. Serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis and free light-chain analysis may help identify immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, whereas 99m-technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy of the heart may be used to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis due to misfolded transthyretin proteins.",
