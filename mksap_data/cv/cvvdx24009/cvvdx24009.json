  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is coronary artery disease (Option A). On exercise ECG, myocardial ischemia is defined by the development of ST-segment elevations or horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm occurring 80 ms after the J point. Although the resting ECG is normal in this patient, the exercise ECG demonstrates ST-segment elevation in lead aVR (a critical, high-risk finding) and horizontal ST-segment depressions in multiple leads, including II, III, aVF, V4, and V5.Unlike ST-segment changes in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, ST-segment depression on exercise testing cannot localize ischemia. However, the presence of ST-segment elevation in aVR raises suspicion for critical disease of the left main coronary artery in this patient.",
