  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is type A aortic dissection (Option D). The CT scan with contrast shows a dissection plane extending through the aortic arch (arrow). Type A aortic dissection classically presents with the sudden onset of chest or back pain that has a tearing or ripping quality; however, not all patients will have this symptom. Patients also may present with hypertension, syncope, a murmur of aortic regurgitation, or heart failure in the setting of sudden aortic insufficiency. The findings of asymmetric blood pressures in the upper extremities, asymmetric pulses, or pulsus paradoxus should all raise suspicion for acute aortic dissection.",
