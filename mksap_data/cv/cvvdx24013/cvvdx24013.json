  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is pericarditis (Option C), as the ECG demonstrates the classic changes associated with acute pericarditis, including diffuse ST-segment elevations and a depressed PR interval. The ECG manifestations of pericarditis evolve over time and are classified into stages: Stage 1 is characterized by diffuse ST-segment elevations; stage 2 by “pseudonormalization,” in which the ST segments normalize; stage 3 by diffuse T-wave inversion and possible slightly depressed ST segments; and stage 4 by a return to normal on ECG. This patient's ECG demonstrates diffuse ST-segment elevations and a depressed PR interval in leads I and II, most notably in the lead II rhythm strip, consistent with the diagnosis of pericarditis.",
