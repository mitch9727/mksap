  "critique": "This patient most likely has aortic coarctation (Option A), as suggested by the radiographic finding of an indentation at the coarctation site (black arrow), with a “figure 3 sign” caused by concomitant dilatation of the aorta above (blue arrow) and below (red arrow) the area of coarctation. This frontal chest radiograph also demonstrates “notching” of the inferior borders of several ribs (yellow circles). Rib notching is caused by erosion of the rib by forceful pulsations of dilated intercostal arteries involved in collateral blood flow.",
