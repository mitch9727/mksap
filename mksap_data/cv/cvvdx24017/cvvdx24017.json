This patient's chest radiograph shows a widened superior mediastinum and a right pleural effusion consistent with aortic dissection, although these findings are not diagnostic. The diagnosis of aortic dissection can be established with transesophageal echocardiography, CT angiography, or MR angiography, all of which have similar sensitivity and specificity for acute thoracic aortic disease. Because of its wide availability and short image acquisition time, CT angiography is the primary diagnostic test for acute thoracic aortic disease.",
