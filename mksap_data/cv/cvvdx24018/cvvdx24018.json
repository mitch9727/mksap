  "critique": "The ECG findings are consistent with sinus bradycardia (Option D), as there is a normal-appearing P wave preceding each QRS complex with a normal PR interval. Sinus bradycardia (sinus rhythm with a heart rate <50/min) may be appropriate in several situations, including in trained athletes or during sleep, when the heart rate may fall as low as 30/min. This patient's heart rate is approximately 47/min. A premature atrial contraction is also seen. The normal P wave conduction precludes the diagnosis of an atrioventricular block.",
