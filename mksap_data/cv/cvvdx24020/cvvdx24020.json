In the Buerger test for assessing arterial perfusion, the patient's foot color is observed when it is elevated and again when it is dependent. The likelihood ratio of a positive finding (elevation pallor and dependent rubor) in the symptomatic extremity is 2.8 for PAD. This patient has right foot pallor with elevation and dependent rubor, consistent with the diagnosis of PAD.",
