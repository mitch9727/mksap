  "critique": "The ECG shown demonstrates a junctional (or atrioventricular nodal) rhythm (Option C). Junctional rhythms are regular supraventricular rhythms in which the P wave in lead II is negative, preceding or following the QRS complex (arrows), or is absent. An atrioventricular nodal escape rhythm occurs when the junctional rate is between 40/min and 60/min and the sinoatrial node is delayed or fails to function as the pacemaker. An accelerated junctional rhythm occurs when the junctional rate is between 61/min and 99/min and the junctional rate takes over the pacemaker function. Junctional tachycardia occurs when the junctional rate is faster than 99/min and takes over the pacemaker function.",
