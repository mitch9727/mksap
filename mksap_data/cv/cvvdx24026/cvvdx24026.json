  "critique": "This ECG demonstrates sinus tachycardia (Option D), defined as a sinus rhythm (a normal P-wave axis with an upright P wave in lead II and a constant PR interval) with a heart rate of 100/min or faster. The consistent and normal P wave morphology makes the other answer options less likely. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, for example, is typically characterized by an increased rate with a short RP interval and a retrograde P wave very close to the QRS complex. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia is similarly characterized by a short PR interval and slurring of the initial QRS complex secondary to conduction over an accessory pathway.",
