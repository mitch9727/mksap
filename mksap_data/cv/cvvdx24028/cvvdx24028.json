  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is constrictive pericarditis (Option B). Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by pericardial thickening, fibrosis, and sometimes calcification that impair diastolic filling and limit total cardiac volume. Chest radiography or CT may demonstrate partial or circumferential pericardial calcification, and CT or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may demonstrate pericardial thickening (>3 mm). Importantly, constriction may exist in the absence of these findings. This patient's chest radiograph shows pericardial calcification on both the posterior-anterior (black arrow) and lateral (white arrows) views.",
