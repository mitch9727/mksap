Although polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (e.g., torsades de pointes) can show highly variable QRS complexes as the axis of the rhythm rotates, there is still recognizable ventricular activity. Similarly, both accelerated junctional rhythm and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia have easily recognizable and discrete ventricular waveforms.",
