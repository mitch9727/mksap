First-degree atrioventricular block, which is characterized by a prolonged PR interval (>200 ms or >5 small boxes on an ECG), is usually a benign condition and does not require intervention. It is most commonly secondary to use of medications that slow atrioventricular node conduction; degeneration of the node; infiltrative cardiomyopathies; or, as in this case, high vagal tone.",
