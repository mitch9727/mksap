The ultrasound shows the abdominal aorta in cross-section with a maximal diameter of 1.85 cm, with measurements taken from outer wall to outer wall. The normal maximal diameter of the abdominal aorta is 3 cm; therefore, the abdominal aorta in this ultrasound is normal in size and without evidence of aneurysmal dilation. The aorta (Ao) is positioned just anterior to the vertebral bodies (VB), which appear hyperechoic (white) on the anterior surface with acoustic shadowing posteriorly. The aorta appears round, smooth, and anechoic (black).",
