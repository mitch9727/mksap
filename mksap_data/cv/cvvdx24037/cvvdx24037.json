  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is cardiac implantable electronic device infection (Option B). Device-associated infections have many different forms, ranging from subtle-appearing pocket infections to endocarditis. Most infections are caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Symptoms of cardiac device infection include fever, chills, malaise, lassitude, and failure to thrive; many infections can be insidious in onset and manifestation. Physical examination of the pocket may reveal erythema, swelling, drainage, wound dehiscence, or device erosion. In this patient's case, the device has eroded through the skin.",
