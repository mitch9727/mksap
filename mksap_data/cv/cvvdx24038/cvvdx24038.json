  "critique": "This ECG shows Mobitz type 2 second-degree atrioventricular block (Option C), which is characterized by regularly occurring nonconducted P waves. In this ECG, two nonconducted P waves are seen after the third QRS complex on the rhythm strip. In Mobitz type 2 block, the PR intervals for conducted beats are constant. In contrast, in Mobitz type 1 second-degree atrioventricular block, the PR intervals are increasingly longer before a nonconducted or blocked P wave. The findings on this ECG do not represent complete (third-degree) heart block, as there is still intermittent conduction of the P waves to the ventricles. However, Mobitz type 2 block is nearly as significant; it typically represents infra-Hisian conduction disease, a much less benign manifestation compared with Mobitz type 1 block, which usually occurs at the nodal level. This ECG also demonstrates high-grade atrioventricular block, which is defined as the absence of conduction of more than one successive P wave.",
