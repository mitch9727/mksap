  "critique": "This CT scan shows a type B aortic dissection (Option D). The ascending aorta (blue arrow) appears normal in caliber and without a dissecting flap separating the true and false lumen. The descending thoracic aorta is dilated, and true and false lumens are separated by a flap (red arrow). There is intact flow within the false lumen (contrast enhancement is equal on both sides of the dissection plane). In contrast, in an aortic hematoma, there is a crescent-shaped collection of blood within the media without interruption of the intima. In a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, blood is localized at the site of the ulcer and is contained within the intima-medial layer (pseudoaneurysm).",
