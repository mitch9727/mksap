  "critique": "This patient's ultrasound shows a large, circumferential pericardial effusion (arrows) (Option A), with evidence of cardiac tamponade. An anechoic space is seen between the liver in the near field and the myocardium of the heart and also surrounds the entire heart, indicating a large effusion. Cardiac tamponade is suggested by collapse of the right atrium or the right ventricle during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. In this study, the right ventricular free wall appears to “wiggle,” which is caused by the inward diastolic movement typical in tamponade.",
