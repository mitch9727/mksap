  "question_text": "A 45-year-old woman is evaluated for an 18-month history of progressive fatigue and dyspnea. Blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg, pulse rate is 76/min, and respiration rate is normal. The apical impulse is slightly sustained but not displaced. Auscultation is performed at the cardiac apex.(We recommend listening to this clip with headphones or external speakers rather than internal computer or mobile phone speakers. It may be helpful to maximize the volume setting of the listening device. In the videos, a cotton swab is placed on the carotid artery to help identify the timing of cardiac sounds and murmurs and, in some cases, to provide a visual representation of the carotid artery configuration.)",

  "critique": "This patient has the typical findings of mitral stenosis (Option C), including a diastolic opening snap followed by a long, low-frequency diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. The cotton swab moves up with systole and down with the murmur, identifying the murmur as diastolic. The murmur peaks during mid-diastole and again before a loud S1. The murmur of mitral stenosis is best appreciated by auscultating with the bell of the stethoscope with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position.Aortic regurgitation produces a high-pitched diastolic murmur heard best along the mid left sternal border. Mitral regurgitation produces a high-pitched holosystolic murmur loudest at the cardiac apex. The murmur of pulmonary regurgitation is early diastolic, best heard over the left second and third interspaces and increases in intensity with inspiration.",
