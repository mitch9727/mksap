  "critique": "The ECG shows premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (Option B) in a bigeminal pattern, which likely accounts for the patient's symptoms. The pulse rate of 38/min underscores the cause of the symptoms. Despite an electrical rate roughly twice that, only the narrow QRS beats are perfusing; thus, the patient feels an effective heart rate of 38/min, representing physiologic bradycardia but not electrical bradycardia.There are no ECG findings consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and the QT is difficult to interpret in the setting of frequent ventricular ectopy. Furthermore, this patient's symptoms are not typical of either Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or long QT syndrome, in which palpitations and syncope are more common.",
