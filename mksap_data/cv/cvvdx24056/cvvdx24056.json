  "critique": "This healthy pregnant patient most likely has atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (Option B), the most common supraventricular tachycardia. AVNRT is caused by a reentrant circuit within the atrioventricular node that uses both the fast and slow pathways. AVNRT is typically characterized by a short RP interval with a retrograde P wave inscribed very close to the QRS complex. This ECG shows a narrow-complex tachycardia at 144/min and no visible P waves.The regular rhythm and absence of risk factors for atrial fibrillation (e.g., diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, sleep apnea) make atrial fibrillation much less likely in this patient. In addition, the absence of P waves excludes atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), an accessory pathway–mediated tachycardia; orthodromic AVRT has a narrow QRS complex with P waves, and antidromic AVRT has a wider QRS complex with P waves. Sinus tachycardia is also ruled out by the absence of P waves.",
