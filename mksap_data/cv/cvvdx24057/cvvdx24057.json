  "critique": "This patient has symptomatic atrial flutter (Option C), featured by regular continuous atrial activity best seen in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). In this tracing, the atrial flutter is conducted irregularly through the atrioventricular node, making the pulse irregular. However, the underlying atrial activity is organized and regular, thus excluding atrial fibrillation. The relatively large flutter waves can complicate interpretation of ischemic or QRS changes; however, there are no clear signs of ST-segment elevation or consistent QRS prolongation suggestive of acute coronary syndrome or right bundle branch block, respectively.",
