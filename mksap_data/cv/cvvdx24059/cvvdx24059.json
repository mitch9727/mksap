  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Option D), also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy or apical ballooning syndrome. ECG changes are common in stress-induced cardiomyopathy. ST-segment elevation is the most common abnormality, most frequently in the anterior precordial leads. Other changes may include deep T-wave inversion with QT-interval prolongation, abnormal Q waves, and nonspecific abnormalities. Because stress-induced cardiomyopathy may mimic ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with similar ECG changes and elevated troponin levels (albeit relatively lower in stress-induced cardiomyopathy), urgent angiography is warranted. In this patient whose symptoms began during a stressful event and in whom the angiogram was normal, stress-induced cardiomyopathy is a much more likely diagnosis than microvascular coronary artery disease or resolved STEMI, neither of which would show such persistent ECG changes.",
