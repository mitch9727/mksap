  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is premature atrial contractions (PACs) (Option B). PACs are early isolated beats that arise from the atria. They are exceedingly common, and their frequency increases with age. In this patient, the irregular pulse may be caused by PACs that are conducted and yield an irregular early pulse, or irregularity may result from PACs that are blocked in the atrioventricular node, resulting in irregular compensatory pauses.Atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, and sinus arrhythmia also may yield an irregular pulse, with or without symptoms. However, the presence of discrete P waves on the ECG excludes atrial fibrillation, and the absence of premature wide QRS complexes excludes premature ventricular contractions. The ECG reveals premature P waves with morphology differing from sinus rhythm, ruling out sinus arrhythmia.",
