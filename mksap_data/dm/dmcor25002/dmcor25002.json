The lesion has been present for over 3 years, but the irritation and redness are new. There has been no change in size of the lesion.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Skin findings are shown. There are several other similar lesions on the trunk.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient's inflamed seborrheic keratosis is cryotherapy (Option A). Seborrheic keratoses are the most common benign skin tumors in adults. Typically occurring after middle age, seborrheic keratoses present as warty, “stuck-on” papules or plaques, most commonly on the trunk; they involve only the epidermis. Seborrheic keratoses range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, are usually hyperpigmented, and range in color from tan to brown or black. The sign of Leser-Trélat is the sudden eruption of numerous seborrheic keratoses and is associated with an internal malignancy. Diagnosis of seborrheic keratoses can usually be made clinically, but shave biopsy can be confirmatory when there is concern for melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Reassurance is typically the appropriate management, but seborrheic keratoses are often treated if irritated or pruritic, or for cosmetic reasons. Seborrheic keratoses usually become irritated and inflamed owing to chronic friction from clothing, but inflammation of seborrheic keratoses may occur during chemotherapy; cytarabine and docetaxel are the most implicated drugs. When indicated and if the diagnosis is certain, the most common treatment is cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen.Mupirocin ointment (Option B) is effective in treating superficial skin infections typically caused by gram-positive bacteria (staphylococci and streptococci). The redness and irritation of this patient's lesion are subacute and nonprogressive, inconsistent with bacterial infection.If the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis is in doubt, a shave removal (Option C) and submission for histologic evaluation would be appropriate. This patient's lesion has been present without change in size for years, and its tan, warty, “stuck-on” appearance is classic for a seborrheic keratosis, so no biopsy is necessary.Topical 5-fluorouracil (Option D) is an approved treatment for actinic keratoses. It can also be used to treat superficial basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Actinic keratoses are typically pink, thin papules or plaques that occur on sun-exposed areas, particularly the face and dorsal arms; this patient's skin lesion is not consistent with an actinic keratosis.",
