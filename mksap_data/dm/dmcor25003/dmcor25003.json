  "question_text": "A 55-year-old woman is evaluated for a 3-month history of mildly pruritic rash on her feet, with thickening and discoloration of several toenails. She states that she is not concerned about the toenails because polish covers them. She has no other medical problems.Skin findings are shown. The lesions are flat.Upon removing the toenail polish, several nails are dystrophic, with subungual keratosis and discoloration. There is no nail pitting.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient with tinea pedis is clotrimazole cream (Option D). The most common form of tinea pedis is the interdigital subtype, characterized by skin maceration and peeling between the toes (shown), especially between the fourth and fifth digits.The “moccasin”-distribution subtype of chronic tinea pedis presents with superficial, desquamative scaling over the soles and extending upward over the lateral and medial feet. The leading edge may be raised and arcuate or annular. Tinea pedis can also have a more acute form, characterized by extremely pruritic, tiny vesicles. All forms of tinea pedis can be burning and itchy. Onychomycosis frequently co-occurs with tinea, often providing a diagnostic clue to the condition. “Two feet–one hand” is a characteristic pattern of involvement also suggestive of the diagnosis. Tinea pedis can be suspected on the basis of clinical presentation; however, the visualization of branching hyphae on microscopic examination of the scale can confirm the diagnosis if it is in doubt. Tinea should be treated to prevent skin breakdown, which can be an entry port for bacterial infection. Dermatophytosis of non–hair-bearing skin with limited involvement can be treated with topical terbinafine or imidazole creams, applied once to twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks, ensuring that the application extends a few centimeters beyond the advancing border. Combined antifungals and topical glucocorticoids should be avoided because they can lead to increased recurrences and treatment failures. Unlike cutaneous candidiasis, dermatophyte infections do not respond to nystatin. This patient has classic moccasin-distribution tinea pedis requiring an effective antifungal cream, such as clotrimazole.Oral cephalexin (Option A) is an appropriate therapy for nonpurulent cellulitis, but the chronic nature of this patient's symptoms, absence of constitutional findings, and appearance of her rash are not consistent with a diagnosis of cellulitis.Although systemic antifungal agents, such as terbinafine (Option B), can be effective in the treatment of onychomycosis, this patient is not concerned with treating her toenails. Onychomycosis is typically treated only for cosmetic reasons or if the dystrophic nails are causing discomfort or recurrent infections due to local trauma.Topical calcipotriene (Option C) is one option in the treatment of plaque psoriasis, which can affect the soles of the feet. The serpiginous, scaly borders of this patient's rash are not typical of psoriasis, and the plaques with silvery scale commonly associated with that condition are not present.",

  "key_points": [
    "Chronic tinea pedis presents as mildly pruritic scaly patches involving most of the soles in a “moccasin” distribution; the interdigital variant of chronic tinea pedis shows fissures and maceration in the folds.",
    "Recommended treatment of localized tinea on non–hair-bearing skin is terbinafine or imidazole creams, such as miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole."
