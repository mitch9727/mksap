  "question_text": "A 60-year-old woman is evaluated for a 6-week history of an intensely itchy rash on her trunk and arms. The itchiness is worse at night. She used topical clotrimazole without improvement. Her husband also has a pruritic rash that has been present during this time. Medical history is significant for hypertension, and her only medication is hydrochlorothiazide.On physical examination, vital signs are normal.Skin findings are shown.There is no face or scalp involvement or petechiae.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test in this patient with likely scabies infestation is a mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings (Option A). Scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) infestation is characterized by intensely pruritic, crusted papules, nodules, and burrows with a characteristic distribution, which includes the wrists, interdigital spaces, periumbilical area/waistline, and genitals. Scabies is highly infectious, and patients often report similar symptoms in a close contact (family member, roommate). Diagnosis of scabies infestation is confirmed by microscopic identification of mites, eggs, or scybala (feces) with a mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings (Figure: Microscopic Image of a Scabies Mite). Scabies can be treated with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin. Pruritus may persist for weeks after eradication of scabies and does not necessarily represent resistance or reinfection. Postscabetic pruritus can be treated with antihistamines; topical glucocorticoids; and, if severe, oral glucocorticoids. This patient presents with erythematous, excoriated papules without scale or petechiae concentrated on the waistline and present on the ventral wrists while sparing the face and scalp, all of which are consistent with scabies infestation. Mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings is the most appropriate diagnostic test.Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of skin scrapings (Option B) would be an appropriate diagnostic test to identify fungal elements if tinea were suspected. Tinea corporis typically presents with annular, erythematous, scaly patches and/or plaques in a seborrheic distribution. This patient presents with diffuse erythematous papules and excoriations, which are not consistent with tinea corporis, and a KOH preparation is not indicated.A shave skin biopsy (Option C) is not the initial diagnostic test of choice. This patient's clinical examination shows a classic presentation of scabies, and a less-invasive diagnostic test should be used initially. If a mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings were negative, a shave skin biopsy could be considered. However, for an inflammatory condition as seen in this patient, a punch biopsy would be preferred, as it would yield a better sampling of the dermis.A Wood lamp is an inexpensive ultraviolet light that makes certain cells fluoresce or appear in different colors. Wood lamp examination (Option D) is a quick and painless test that can help differentiate pigment disorders (e.g., vitiligo or melasma), fungal infections (e.g., pityriasis versicolor [tinea versicolor] or Pityrosporum folliculitis), or bacterial infections (e.g., erythrasma). This patient has a classic presentation of scabies, and a mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings should be utilized before a Wood lamp examination of the rash.",
