  "question_text": "A 58-year-old man is hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal. He reports that his gums have been bleeding for the last few weeks. He has also had an asymptomatic rash on the lower extremities for about 4 months. Other than alcohol use disorder, his medical history is unremarkable. The patient is unhoused. He takes no chronic medications; inpatient medications are thiamine, folate, and lorazepam.On physical examination, blood pressure 155/92 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 110/min; other vital signs are normal. Some bleeding is noted at the dental margin of the maxillary and mandibular gingivae. There is no angular cheilitis. Additional findings are shown and more prominent at the underwear and sock lines.No rash is present on the genitalia or perineum. Many leg hairs have a corkscrew appearance.Laboratory studies, including a platelet count, prothrombin time, and INR are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next is a vitamin C level (Option D) measurement. Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) is likely underdiagnosed in the United States. It is most commonly diagnosed in patients with a restrictive or limited diet, sometimes in the setting of alcohol use disorder. Vitamin C plays a critical role in collagen synthesis, and deficiency may result in gingival bleeding, perifollicular hemorrhage, coiled “corkscrew” hairs, petechiae, purpura, and splinter hemorrhages. Hemarthroses, edema, dyspnea, and death may occur in advanced cases. Clinical findings suggest the diagnosis, which can be confirmed by measuring vitamin C levels. Many manifestations of vitamin C deficiency respond quickly to oral supplementation. Patients typically have more than one nutritional deficiency, thus concomitant deficiencies should be considered. This patient with alcohol use disorder has the typical presentation of scurvy with nonpalpable purpura, perifollicular hemorrhages, and corkscrew hair. A serum vitamin C level measurement is the most appropriate next test to perform.Results of ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) (Option A) testing are positive in several inflammatory conditions, including ANCA-associated vasculitides, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. These small-vessel vasculitides may feature palpable petechiae, with the palpability developing secondary to edema created by the inflammatory process. In this patient, the petechiae are nonpalpable, making an inflammatory process such as vasculitis an unlikely diagnosis.Skin biopsy (Option B) is rarely valuable in evaluation of nonpalpable petechiae. Biopsy findings are those of noninflammatory extravasation and are highly nonspecific. Causes of noninflammatory erythrocyte extravasation include trauma, thrombocytopenia, and collagen disorders (e.g., scurvy, Marfan syndrome). This patient has scurvy, and skin biopsy will provide little help confirming the diagnosis.Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option C) is usually the result of malabsorption states such as inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or bacterial overgrowth. Dietary deficiency can be causative but is much less common. Vitamin B12 deficiency is characterized by a macrocytic anemia and dorsal column dysfunction with spastic ataxia and loss of vibratory sense and proprioception. Angular cheilitis and glossitis can also be found in vitamin B12 deficiency. In this patient, the presence of petechiae and corkscrew hairs and the lack of angular cheilitis and glossitis are inconsistent with the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.",
