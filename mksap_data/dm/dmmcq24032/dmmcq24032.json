  "question_text": "A 42-year-old man is evaluated for a 4-week history of itching in the groin. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Annular scaly plaques with serpiginous borders are present bilaterally on the inguinal creases, sparing the scrotum. The scalp and hair are normal. Examination of the feet shows similar annular and serpiginous plaques at the border of the sole and the lateral foot. There are no findings on the nails, elbows, or knees. No pustules are present.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient with tinea (dermatophytosis) cruris is topical terbinafine (Option D). Similar to other forms of dermatophytosis, tinea cruris is usually caused by infection with the fungi Epidermophyton, Microsporum, or, most commonly, Trichophyton. It presents as annular/serpiginous scaly patches with central clearing and varying degrees of inflammation in the groin. The serpiginous border distinguishes tinea cruris from other causes of annular scaly plaques. Tinea cruris also typically spares the scrotum, which differentiates it from intertrigo. Concomitant tinea pedis and cruris are common. When the diagnosis is unclear, the demonstration of fungal elements on potassium hydroxide preparation of skin scrapings from the scaly border is confirmatory. Treatment with topical terbinafine, a fungicidal squalene epoxidase inhibitor, is very effective in limited dermatophytosis in non–hair-bearing areas; imidazole creams, such as miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole, can also be used. In cases of tinea cruris, tinea pedis is usually a reservoir for dermatophyte infection, and the organism is dragged up to the groin when donning undergarments. Putting on socks before underwear can be helpful in recurrent cases. This patient has tinea cruris as evidenced by annular, scaly plaques with serpiginous borders that are present bilaterally on the inguinal creases, sparing the scrotum. He should be treated with topical terbinafine.Subcutaneous adalimumab (Option A), a biologic tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, is effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Tinea pedis and cruris can be mistaken for psoriasis, but psoriasis does not cause the annular plaques with serpiginous borders seen in tinea. Adalimumab has no activity against dermatophytes and would not be an appropriate treatment in this patient.Topical clobetasol (Option B), an ultrapotent topical glucocorticoid, inhibits a local defense against dermatophytes and may exacerbate cutaneous skin infections such as tinea cruris. Thus, use of topical glucocorticoids such as clobetasol is not appropriate in this patient.Topical nystatin (Option C) is an effective treatment for cutaneous or oropharyngeal candidiasis but is ineffective in the treatment of the dermatophytes, which are the causative organisms in tinea cruris. The use of topical nystatin in this patient would not be appropriate.",
