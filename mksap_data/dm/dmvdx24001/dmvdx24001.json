  "critique": "Superficial spreading melanoma (Option D) is the most common variant of malignant melanoma. As in this example, it presents as a well-defined, asymmetric patch or plaque with an irregular border and variation in color, and initially spreads horizontally. Most skin cancers occur on sun-exposed skin, but superficial spreading melanoma tends to occur on the back in men and the legs in women (areas that receive intermittent sun exposure and are prone to sunburn). In contrast, pigmented seborrheic keratoses have a “stuck-on” appearance and solar lentigo are homogenously pigmented brown macules. Melanocytic nevi have a variable appearance but are typically evenly pigmented, small, and symmetrical brown-to-black macules or papules.",
