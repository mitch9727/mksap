Seborrheic keratoses are common, benign neoplasms that present as tan or brown-to-black, well-demarcated, \"stuck-on\"–appearing lesions with waxy surfaces and horn cysts (dark keratin plugs). The number of seborrheic keratoses can vary from an isolated lesion to hundreds, and they are commonly located on the trunk, face, and upper extremities. A \"Christmas tree\" pattern (Blaschko lines distribution) may be seen on the back.",
