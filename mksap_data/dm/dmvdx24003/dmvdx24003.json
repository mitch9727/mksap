  "critique": "Onychomycosis (Option C) is a common dermatophytosis of the nail. Toenails are most commonly affected, and distal subungual onychomycosis is the most common pattern. The distal nail plate becomes discolored (yellow, white, or brown) and thickened. Under the nail plate, there is an accumulation of subungual debris, resulting in separation of the nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Onychomycosis can be seen in association with diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or immunosuppression; skin conditions such as tinea pedis; and poor nail hygiene. Confirmation of infection with potassium hydroxide preparation, periodic acid-Schiff staining, or fungal culture should be performed before treatment to rule out psoriasis or traumatic nail changes.",
