  "critique": "Actinic keratoses (Option A) are precancerous lesions (arrows) that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. They typically present in sun-exposed areas as erythematous lesions with overlying hyperkeratosis that are often scaly to touch. Actinic keratoses may be easier to feel than to see. In contrast, seborrheic keratoses are pigmented lesions with a “stuck-on” appearance. Superficial basal cell carcinoma may resemble actinic keratoses but appear as a pink-red patch, often with a slight thread-like pearly border. Verruca vulgaris are typically seen as skin-colored verrucous papules that are keratotic and exophytic.",
