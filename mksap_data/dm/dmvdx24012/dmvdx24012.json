The individual skin lesions of Sweet syndrome are tender, nonpruritic, brightly erythematous, well-demarcated papules and plaques that appear on the face, neck, and extremities. In addition to the skin eruption, patients typically have fever, leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and muscle or joint pain.Sweet syndrome may be idiopathic, but most cases typically develop after an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection or in the setting of hematologic abnormalities, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome evolving into acute myeloid leukemia.",
