  "critique": "Lentigo maligna (Option A) begins as a uniformly pigmented, light-brown patch on the face or upper trunk that is confined to the epidermis and, as such, is an in-situ melanoma. Over time, the lesion expands and becomes more variegated in color, which may be more apparent on dermoscopy, as shown. Lentigo maligna melanoma is the term applied to lentigo maligna that has invaded the dermis. Biopsy is necessary to differentiate lentigo maligna from lentigo maligna melanoma. In both in-situ and invasive forms, melanoma cells extend far beyond the clinically apparent borders of the lesion.",
