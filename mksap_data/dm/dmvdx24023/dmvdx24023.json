Tinea cruris is a dermatophyte infection of the groin, pubic region, and thighs, which manifests as an annular lesion with a slight scale, an erythematous, well-demarcated edge, and incomplete central clearing. Tinea can be suspected based on clinical presentation and pruritus; however, diagnosis is based on visualization by microscopic examination of branching hyphae in the keratin (scale) using a potassium hydroxide preparation.",
