Lesions often occur in a series (\"breakfast, lunch, and dinner\"), as seen in this patient, on exposed sites, such as the face, neck, arms, and hands. The lesions are painless but pruritic and appear as urticaria-like papules with a central hemorrhagic punctum.Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus (bed bugs) are nocturnal insects that appear as shown. They typically hide in cracks and crevices, especially in mattresses, cushions, and bed frames, during the day and bite at night.",
