Hand dermatitis often results from a combination of causes, such as excessive hand washing, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, or dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx). It is commonly seen in patients who have jobs involving frequent or prolonged exposure to water, chemicals, and occlusive gloves (health care, house cleaning, food preparation, hairstyling).",
