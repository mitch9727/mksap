  "critique": "This patient has lichen planus (LP), an inflammatory skin disorder that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, scalp, and/or nails (Option B). The hallmark lesion of LP is a pruritic, purple, polygonal papule; these papules are usually distributed symmetrically on the wrists, flexural aspects of the arms and legs, lower back, and genitals. The face, palms, and soles are usually spared; however, mucous membranes, including the lips, mouth, and vulva, are commonly involved. The papules are small and may be isolated or grouped together; they often develop along lines of previous trauma. A reticulated network of white lines (Wickham striae) may be visible on the surface of the papules, particularly if moistened (shown in a different patient). LP occurs with increased frequency in patients with liver disease, particularly hepatitis C virus infection, although the reasons for this are unclear.",
