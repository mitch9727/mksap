Patients present with vesicles, bullae, and skin fragility on sun-exposed skin, most commonly on the face, dorsal hands (as seen in this patient), and scalp; photosensitivity is the hallmark of the disease. Other features include hyperpigmentation, milia (tiny inclusion cysts), hypertrichosis, and alopecia. Up to 50% of patients with sporadic PCT have hepatitis C virus infection.",
