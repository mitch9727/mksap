  "critique": "This patient has pityriasis versicolor (tinea versicolor) (Option D). Pityriasis versicolor is characterized by slightly scaly hyper- or hypopigmented macules and patches of the upper trunk and upper arms. The causative yeast organism, Malassezia furfur, is a normal inhabitant of the skin; however, when hot and humid environmental conditions favor its growth, findings appear. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic evaluation of a potassium hydroxide preparation made from scrapings of lesions. The preparation shown demonstrates the classic appearance of both spores and hyphae in a \"spaghetti and meatball\" pattern.",
