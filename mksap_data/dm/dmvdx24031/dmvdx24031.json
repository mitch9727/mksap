  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme (EM), an immune-mediated condition that can be recognized by its classic targetoid plaques (Option B). The sharply defined plaques feature three color zones: a pale, dusky, vesiculated or crusted center surrounded by two differently colored concentric rings (a pale inner ring and a red outer ring). These plaques typically appear on the face and acral sites. Mucosal lesions are present in up to 70% of patients. Crops of lesions persist for approximately 7 days and resolve without scarring.Most cases of EM are caused by infections, with herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 being the most common. Drug-induced cases of EM are less frequent and typically result from NSAIDs, antiepileptic agents, or sulfonamides.",
