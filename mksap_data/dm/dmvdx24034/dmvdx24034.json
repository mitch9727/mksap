As in this case, squamous cell carcinoma presents as a slowly evolving, isolated keratotic or eroded macule, papule, or nodule. It most commonly appears on sun-exposed skin, including the face, scalp, neck, pinna, lip, or extremities.In contrast, a basal cell carcinoma typically demonstrates a heaped-up waxy or pearly border, whereas a keratoacanthoma usually presents as a rapidly growing nodule with a central area of keratinized material.",
