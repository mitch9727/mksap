Oropharyngeal erosions are almost always present in pemphigus vulgaris and are frequently the presenting manifestation. The trunk, including the axillae, scalp, and neck, are often involved. Affected skin has flaccid blisters that generally develop on noninflamed skin; are readily broken; and progress to large, weeping, denuded areas. NSAIDs, rifampin, cephalosporins, captopril, and penicillamine have been associated with this condition.",
