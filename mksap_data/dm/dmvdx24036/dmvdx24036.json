The most common areas of involvement include the scalp (dandruff), nasolabial folds (as seen in this patient), cheeks, and medial eyebrows. The external auditory canals, skin behind the ears, and mid-chest may also be involved. Erythema of the eyelids associated with yellow crusting between the eyelashes (blepharitis) may be the only manifestation of seborrheic dermatitis in some patients.",
