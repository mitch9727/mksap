Thrombosed capillaries manifesting as black dots are seen when the top of the wart is pared down. Other types of warts include verruca plana (flat warts), which are skin-colored, flat-topped papules; condyloma acuminata (genital warts), which are smooth to digitate papules that are skin-colored to tan; and verruca plantaris/palmaris (plantar/palmar warts), which are exo-/endophytic papules with thrombosed capillaries. Warts (verruca and condyloma) are caused by human papillomavirus.",
