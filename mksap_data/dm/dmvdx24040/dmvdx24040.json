  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (Option C). The typical skin findings of TEN are painful, flat, purpuric, targetoid lesions that coalesce into dusky, poorly demarcated, confluent patches. Alternatively, confluent, tender erythema without identifiable individual lesions may occur. The involved epidermis blisters and sloughs in sheets of skin, leaving behind denuded dermis. This image shows erythema, sloughing skin, and a small area of denuded dermis next to the gluteal cleft.Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is usually associated with more intense erythema than is seen in this image but may have skin sloughing as well. Toxic shock syndrome has more limited skin findings, most frequently erythema and subsequent desquamation of the palms and soles. Bullous pemphigoid presents with urticarial plaques that progress to persistent tense bullae accompanied by oral involvement in approximately 20% of patients.",
