  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is keratoacanthoma (Option C), a form of rapidly growing skin tumor that is related to squamous cell carcinoma. Early lesions present as solitary, round nodules that grow over weeks, usually on sun-exposed areas. As the lesions mature, a central keratotic plug becomes visible, and the lesion becomes craterlike. Keratoacanthomas may involute spontaneously over a period of weeks to months, but surgical excision is recommended because of the relationship with squamous cell carcinoma.",
