Perifollicular petechiae of the skin occur around the skin's hair follicles and represent small (≤2 mm) hemorrhages, which occur due to the frailty of the capillary walls. Other signs of vitamin C deficiency include coiled (corkscrew) hairs, bruising, and impaired wound healing. Patients commonly develop gingivitis (shown), as well as gingival hemorrhages, also caused by capillary frailty.",
