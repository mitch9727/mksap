  "critique": "This patient most likely has a first-degree burn (Option A). Thermal burns are assessed based on the amount of body surface area involvement, the depth of burn, and the specific area involved. First-degree burns involve the epidermis and result in painful, red, and tender skin, as seen in this patient. Second-degree burns destroy the epidermis; there is partial involvement of the dermis resulting in blisters, weeping, and sloughed skin that is painful to air and touch. Third-degree burns involve the epidermis and fat and may involve muscle and bone; the burn surface is white or black with minimal associated pain.",
