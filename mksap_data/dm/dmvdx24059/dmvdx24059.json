  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) (Option C), a chronic condition of unknown etiology featuring sterile inflammation of the apocrine component of the pilosebaceous unit. HS often starts at puberty but may affect any age group. Patients experience tender red nodules, which proceed to develop an abscess-like appearance and often drain. The axillae, groin, gluteal cleft, inguinal crease, and inframammary areas are most commonly affected. Over time, the disease is destructive, and scarring and sinus tracts may form complex networks between lesions. HS can lead to physical and psychosocial dysfunction, with very high rates of anxiety and depression in patients. Treatment is variably successful, and includes topical antibiotics (benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin), oral antibiotics (doxycycline, rifampin), and biologic therapy (adalimumab, secukinumab).",
