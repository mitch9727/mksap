The most common type of basal cell carcinoma, nodular basal cell carcinoma appears as a glossy pink to ivory papule or plaque, often featuring a rolled, distinct border and prominent bizarre telangiectases. Over time a central erosion or ulceration may develop. Occasionally, blue-grey flecks of pigmentation may be observed, but these are quite distinct from the broad, dark pigmentation of melanocytic lesions such as malignant melanoma.",
