  "critique": "This patient has allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) (Option A). In this delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to an exogenous agent, vigorous inflammation leads to erythema, and intense intra-epidermal edema (spongiosis) leads to the clinical appearance of pinpoint clustered vesicles in a geometric arrangement. Weeping from the area is common, and inflammation may be so intense as to cause duskiness or mild necrosis at the area of most focused allergen contact. Initial sensitization may result in a rash 48 to 72 hours after exposure, whereas subsequent exposure may lead to rash within only a few hours. The geometric nature of the erythema and vesicles are the best clue to the diagnosis. In the United States, poison ivy, topical neomycin, and nickel are among the most common contact allergens. ACD caused by poison ivy often has a linear appearance where the leaves brushed the skin, while ACD from use of topical medications such as neomycin often has a circular appearance from where they were rubbed into the skin.",
