  "critique": "This patient has actinic keratoses (AK), which are precancerous squamous epidermal proliferations that result from chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure and may progress to squamous cell carcinoma (Option A). Individual keratoses appear as pink scaly macules that may be better appreciated by palpation than by visual inspection and are often described as having a sandpaper-like texture. AK may also sting when touched. Although each individual lesion has very low risk of progression, patients with multiple AK have an elevated lifetime risk of skin cancer. Treatment can be accomplished by simple destruction, commonly with liquid nitrogen, curettage, or chemically with 5-fluorouracil cream. The value of treating AK in preventing squamous cell carcinoma is controversial.",
