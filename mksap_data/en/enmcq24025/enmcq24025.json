  "question_text": "A 67-year-old man is evaluated at a follow-up visit for weight management. He has lost 8% of his body weight through lifestyle interventions over the past 12 months; he follows the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, eats 1800 calories a day, and walks for 150 minutes a week. He is concerned because he has regained 1.8 kg (4 lb) in the last few weeks. Medical history is relevant for hypertension and prediabetes. His only medication is lisinopril.On physical examination, vital signs and other findings are normal. BMI is 25, and waist circumference is 92 cm (36 in).Laboratory studies:Hemoglobin A1c5.8%H",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is to advise the patient to increase his physical activity (Option A) to 200 to 300 minutes per week. Lifestyle interventions are effective for weight loss and should focus on calorie restriction (typically 1500 to 1800 kcal/d for men), exercise/activity, and self-monitoring. Partnering with a weight loss specialist can help improve success. However, weight loss will plateau, and weight regain can often occur. The most effective strategy for preventing weight regain is maintaining moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity for 200 to 300 minutes per week. Ongoing self-weighing and adherence to a lower-calorie diet should also be emphasized. This patient has been successful at losing weight, and advising him to increase his physical activity can help avoid weight regain.All patients should choose a healthy diet that they can maintain with foods they enjoy. Recommended foods include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, seafood, unsalted nuts and seeds, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, and lean meats and poultry. These recommendations are compatible with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets. This patient is already maintaining a lower-calorie healthy diet. Advising him to switch to a Mediterranean diet (Option B) is unnecessary.Metformin is a weight-neutral drug and is not indicated for weight loss. Starting metformin (Option C) is unlikely to result in appreciable weight loss or enhanced weight maintenance.Pharmacologic therapy, such as semaglutide (Option D), can be considered for patients with a BMI of 30 or greater and patients with a BMI of 27 or greater and at least one obesity-associated comorbidity who have not achieved weight loss goals after 3 to 6 months of lifestyle modification. This patient has a BMI of 25 and has been able to lose 8% of his body weight successfully through lifestyle interventions alone. The addition of semaglutide could be considered if he develops type 2 diabetes mellitus or his weight increases.",
