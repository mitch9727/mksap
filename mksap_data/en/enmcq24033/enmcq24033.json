She was hospitalized 1 day ago for nausea, emesis, fatigue, and anorexia of 1 week's duration, which resolved with 24 hours of intravenous hydration. Medical history is relevant for papillary thyroid cancer, treated with thyroidectomy, and sarcoidosis. Outpatient medications are levothyroxine and a multivitamin with minerals.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.Laboratory studies:TodayOn hospitalizationCalcium10.0 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L)11.4 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L)HCreatinine0.9 mg/dL (79.6 μmol/L)Parathyroid hormone<10 pg/mL (10 ng/L)LThyroid-stimulating hormone0.5 μU/mL (0.5 mU/L)1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D70 pg/mL (168 pmol/L)H25-Hydroxyvitamin D30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)L",

  "critique": "This patient with sarcoidosis has vitamin D–dependent hypercalcemia, and her multivitamin should be discontinued (Option B). Sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases (e.g., fungal infection, tuberculosis, lymphoma) can cause vitamin D–dependent hypercalcemia as a result of unregulated conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in granulomatous tissue, leading to enhanced absorption of ingested calcium. These conditions are associated with an inappropriately normal or frankly elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and a suppressed serum parathyroid hormone level. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, reduce granulomatous inflammation and decrease calcium absorption in patients with vitamin D–dependent hypercalcemia by suppressing the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and impeding the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D on calcium absorption in the gut. Additionally, patients with vitamin D–dependent hypercalcemia should avoid supplemental calcium and vitamin D, including multivitamins and mineral supplements, because providing additional substrate for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production and/or additional calcium for absorption will exacerbate hypercalcemia. Patients may also need to reduce dietary sources of calcium and limit sun exposure, depending on lifestyle. General guidelines for managing vitamin D nutrition, including reference ranges for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, should not be applied to patients with vitamin D–dependent hypercalcemia.Subclinical or clinical hyperthyroidism and supraphysiologic doses of exogenous levothyroxine are known to cause increased bone resorption. However, thyrotoxicosis of any origin must be severe to cause any degree of hypercalcemia. Reducing the levothyroxine dosage (Option A) would not affect the risk for recurrent hypercalcemia in this patient.Calcitonin (Option C) can be considered in the acute treatment of patients with severe hypercalcemia. It is not indicated for hypercalcemia prevention.Loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Option D), modestly inhibit calcium reabsorption; however, their impact on calcium homeostasis is limited. Loop diuretics may be used to manage severe hypercalcemia when kidney failure or volume overload limit the use of hydration to increase kidney excretion of calcium. They do not have a role in preventing hypercalcemia.",
