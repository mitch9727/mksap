  "critique": "This patient with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated with parathyroidectomy (Option B). Patients whose symptoms are caused by hypercalcemia have the strongest evidence of improved outcomes after parathyroidectomy. Other indications for surgery include the following:Age younger than 50 yearsSerum calcium level greater than 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normalChanges in kidney function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m, urine calcium level >250 mg/24 h in women or >300 mg/24 h in men, or clinical or imaging evidence of a kidney stone)T-score of −2.5 or less at any siteVertebral fracture on imagingLocalization imaging (e.g., parathyroid sestamibi scan) for the purposes of surgical planning may be negative even when the diagnosis and indications for surgery are certain, and a negative scan does not negate the need for surgery. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for this patient with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism and hypercalciuria. Surgery results in a 95% cure rate; the rate of complications is less than 1% with an experienced surgeon.Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide (Option A), may reduce urine calcium excretion in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, but their impact on the risk for nephrolithiasis is unknown. Although they are generally avoided in primary hyperparathyroidism to avoid exacerbating hypercalcemia, some studies have shown that calcium levels in these patients are not increased with thiazide therapy. Regardless, thiazide diuretics would not improve symptoms caused by hypercalcemia and would not be the most appropriate management for this patient.Antiresorptive medications, such as zoledronate (Option C), prevent bone loss in primary hyperparathyroidism but are not equivalent to parathyroidectomy in restoring normal bone metabolism and structure. Potent antiresorptive medications can also transiently lower serum calcium in primary hyperparathyroidism. However, these temporizing effects are inferior to the enduring effects achieved by surgical correction of hyperparathyroidism.In most circumstances, parathyroidectomy is an elective surgery. A short period of observation could be employed when other medical problems are more pressing or the contribution of primary hyperparathyroidism to symptoms of concern is ambiguous. However, observation alone (Option D) is inappropriate for this patient who has indications for parathyroidectomy.",
