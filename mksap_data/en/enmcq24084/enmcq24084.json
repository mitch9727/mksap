  "question_text": "A 70-year-old patient is evaluated during a follow-up visit for type 2 diabetes mellitus. They feel overwhelmed with their diagnosis and treatment plan and struggle to adhere to their medication and blood glucose monitoring regimens. The patient often does not take their prescribed bedtime insulin because of fear of hypoglycemia. They bring only three self-measured fingerstick blood glucose measurements, showing glucose values of 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), and 195 mg/dL (10.8 mmol/L). Medical history is also significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Medications are metformin, dulaglutide, insulin glargine, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and rosuvastatin.On physical examination, blood pressure is 150/92 mm Hg; other vital signs are normal. BMI is 40.Laboratory studies:Hemoglobin A1c9.5%H",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is to screen for depression (Option C). Anxiety, depression, diabetes-related distress, and cognitive impairment can adversely affect glycemic control directly and through challenges with patient adherence to management plans. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening for psychosocial concerns and behavioral health conditions when diabetes mellitus is first diagnosed and at least annually thereafter. Screening should also be performed when treatment goals are not being met and when changes in disease, treatment, or life circumstances occur. Validated tools, such as the PHQ-9, Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale, and Diabetes Distress Scale, can be used to screen for depression and for diabetes distress and anxiety. This patient demonstrates features of neuropsychological complications of diabetes: an inability to perform diabetes self-care, fear of hypoglycemia, and diabetes distress. The patient should be further evaluated for neuropsychological complications of diabetes. The ADA recommends referral to a behavioral health professional for patients with a behavioral health condition, disordered eating, diabetes distress, difficulty managing diabetes, fear of hypoglycemia, or cognitive dysfunction.The American College of Physicians recommends against adding a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor to metformin as there is no evidence of benefit in reducing mortality, cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalization, kidney disease progression, or severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, combination therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and DPP-4 inhibitors lacks additional glycemic benefit and is not recommended. This patient is already appropriately receiving metformin and dulaglutide, a GLP-1 RA; adding a DPP-4 inhibitor such as sitagliptin (Option A) is not indicated.This patient's elevated hemoglobin A1c and self-measured fingerstick blood glucose values indicate poorly controlled diabetes; medical therapy should be intensified. Although the patient fears overnight hypoglycemia, there is no evidence that this is occurring. Discontinuing insulin therapy (Option B) is not recommended, as it would likely worsen the patient's glycemic control.Donepezil (Option D) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is approved for treating dementia. In this patient, there is insufficient testing or information to diagnose dementia and start medical therapy with donepezil. Patients with cognitive symptoms should undergo cognitive and behavioral assessments, but medical therapy should not be initiated until a formal diagnosis is made.",
