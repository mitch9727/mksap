  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment is transdermal estradiol and spironolactone (Option D). Gender-affirming care is the standard of care for treating gender incongruence and includes hormonal and surgical therapies used to adapt the patient's body to their experienced gender. Hormone therapy is the most common medical intervention sought by transgender persons. Feminizing hormone therapy for a transgender woman (an individual who was assigned male gender at birth but identifies as a woman) includes estrogen in combination with an androgen blocker, such as spironolactone, both used off-label. Estradiol is the preferred formulation of estrogen and is available in several formulations: oral, sublingual, transdermal, and parenteral. Each of these formulations has been shown to be safe and effective as gender-affirming therapy. Androgen blockers include oral spironolactone, oral cyproterone acetate (not approved in the United States), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, such as leuprolide. After therapy is initiated, dosages are titrated appropriately to achieve therapeutic sex hormone (i.e., testosterone and estradiol) levels. Hormone monitoring, evaluation for physical changes, and assessment for adverse reactions should occur every 3 months (or with dosage changes) in the first year and then once or twice per year thereafter ().Estradiol alone (Option A) is not sufficient for feminizing hormone therapy. The addition of an androgen blocker is recommended to achieve the desired effects.Estradiol formulations are recommended over conjugated estrogens when available. Therefore, ethinyl estradiol (Option B), a conjugated formulation of estrogen, is not the most appropriate treatment. Norgestimate, a progestin, is not currently recommended as part of routine care.The addition of progesterone (Option C) as a potential adjunctive therapy to estradiol and androgen blockers is controversial and is not recommended by clinical practice guidelines. Further research is needed to assess the effects of this therapy on transgender women. Additionally, this therapy would not be used alone.Testosterone therapy (Option E) is prescribed as initial gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender men. Testosterone use in this transgender woman would not achieve the desired feminizing effects and could potentially worsen her symptoms.",
