  "critique": "This patient's doses of insulin glargine and insulin aspart should be decreased (Option B). The glucose toxicity experienced at the time of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has diminished with an intensive insulin regimen. His remaining functional pancreatic β cells have regained the ability to produce some insulin in the “honeymoon” phase of type 1 diabetes mellitus, explaining his hypoglycemia on previously well-tolerated insulin doses. The decreased need for insulin will not be long term, because pancreatic β cells continue to be destroyed over the course of type 1 diabetes. Continuing insulin with a combination of basal and prandial insulin, even at low doses, is recommended during the honeymoon phase to preserve β-cell function as long as possible. The patient will require close monitoring of blood glucose levels to determine when insulin doses should be increased as the honeymoon phase nears its end; the duration of the honeymoon phase can be highly variable and may last for several weeks to years.Continuing the same dosages of insulin and increasing caloric consumption (Option A) may not prevent recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and will have the added harm of weight gain. The best option for this patient is to decrease but not discontinue his insulin dosages and to monitor his blood glucose levels.The use of sliding-scale insulin without basal insulin (Option C) is discouraged, as this increases the likelihood of wide swings from hyperglycemia to hypoglycemia. Without basal insulin, the patient may not receive enough daily insulin to decrease the metabolic stress on functioning pancreatic β cells. Thus, discontinuing the patient's basal insulin glargine and changing insulin aspart to a sliding-scale regimen would not be appropriate management.Replacing insulin with metformin (Option D) would not address the insulin deficiency state, and most patients with type 1 diabetes do not have insulin resistance. This change in therapy would increase metabolic stress on the pancreatic β cells and accelerate the loss of functional cells producing insulin. As pancreatic β-cell function declines toward the end of the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes, the risk for DKA increases without any exogenous insulin. Thus, substituting metformin for insulin would not be the correct management in this patient.",
