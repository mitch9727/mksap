  "critique": "The most appropriate management of this patient following adrenalectomy for treatment of Cushing syndrome is hydrocortisone therapy (Option C). Patients who have undergone adrenalectomy for Cushing syndrome are at risk for secondary adrenal insufficiency due to hypercortisolism-induced suppression of the hypothalamic (corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH]) and pituitary (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) axis. Subsequent recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis following removal of the source of excess cortisol secretion can take time; endogenous cortisol production is impaired, and daily glucocorticoid replacement is required. Patients often require higher than physiologic doses of glucocorticoid therapy to prevent “glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome,” an ill-defined complex of symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and myalgia. No glucocorticoid regimen has been agreed on following adrenalectomy and treatment of Cushing syndrome. The process of tapering and eventually discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy is guided by patient symptoms and can be a lengthy process, taking up to 1 year or longer until the remaining adrenal gland can produce adequate cortisol.ACTH-dependent causes of Cushing syndrome also lead to suppressed endogenous CRH and ACTH production, and patients with these disorders also require glucocorticoid therapy following successful treatment of Cushing syndrome.Epinephrine (Option A) is not under ACTH control; therefore, epinephrine replacement is not required after adrenalectomy. Additionally, lack of epinephrine is not known to be associated with clinical disease. Thus, epinephrine administration would not be the most appropriate management in this patient.Fludrocortisone therapy (Option B) is not required following unilateral adrenalectomy as mineralocorticoid secretion is not under ACTH control. Therefore, aldosterone secretion from the contralateral adrenal gland is not affected by Cushing syndrome. Fludrocortisone therapy, however, is required following bilateral adrenalectomy. This patient underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, and fludrocortisone therapy is not necessary.Phenoxybenzamine (Option D) is used as a preoperative α-receptor blockade before surgery for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas to prevent hypertensive crises during surgery and is not indicated following adrenalectomy for Cushing syndrome. Thus, phenoxybenzamine would not be indicated in this patient.",
