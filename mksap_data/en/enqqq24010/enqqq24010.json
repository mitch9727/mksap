  "critique": "The next step in this patient's management is adrenal vein sampling (Option C). When the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism has been confirmed biochemically, radiographic localization with abdominal CT is indicated. Adrenal hyperplasia and adenomas secreting excess aldosterone, however, may not always be visualized. Adrenal vein sampling is, therefore, needed in most patients to determine the source of aldosterone secretion when imaging is unrevealing and to confirm lateralization when imaging demonstrates an adrenal adenoma, such as in this patient. It should be performed provided that the patient is willing to undergo surgical resection if recommended. Adrenal vein sampling is especially important in older patients owing to a higher frequency of nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas. Failure to perform adrenal vein sampling could lead to unnecessary adrenalectomy, as patients with an aldosterone-secreting adenoma are usually offered adrenalectomy, whereas those with primary aldosteronism due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia are treated medically.Aldosterone likely exerts direct toxic effects on cardiac cells, as evidenced by a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased left ventricular function when compared with matched control patients with similar levels of hypertension. These deleterious effects are likely mediated by mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart, coronary arteries, aorta, and other blood vessels. Increasing this patient's losartan or metoprolol dose (Options A, B) may better control his hypertension, but neither of these medications blocks the aldosterone receptor. Therefore, the patient would still experience the deleterious effects of excessive aldosterone receptor stimulation after these dose changes, and such changes would not be the most appropriate management options.Right adrenalectomy (Option D) should not be performed in this patient without further confirming the source of primary aldosteronism because nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas are common in patients who are older than 35 years of age.",
