Radioiodine uptake is elevated in Graves disease (>30%), and this patient's thyroid scan shows diffuse uptake, consistent with the diagnosis of Graves hyperthyroidism. Graves disease is characterized by a diffusely hyperactive thyroid gland with resultant excess thyroid hormone production and subsequent suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion by the pituitary gland.",
