  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is pre-ulcer with callus formation (Option C). Patients with diabetes mellitus have a proclivity to produce large, thick callus formations at pressure points, particularly if associated foot deformities, such as claw toes, are present. Extensive callus formation increases the subcutaneous pressure immediately beneath the callus and can result in a subcutaneous hemorrhage, the so-called pre-ulcer, as seen in this patient. Pre-ulcers must be promptly and carefully debrided to determine whether there is already an underlying ulcer.",
