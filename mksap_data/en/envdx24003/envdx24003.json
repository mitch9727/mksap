This patient's visual field testing demonstrates bitemporal superior/upper quadrant visual field defects suggestive of optic chiasm compression from a pituitary tumor. Suprasellar extension of a pituitary adenoma that compresses the optic chiasm can result in visual symptoms. The most common symptom is diminished vision in the temporal fields (bitemporal hemianopsia). A formal visual field examination is required for any tumor that abuts or compresses the optic chiasm.",
