This patient has hirsutism, defined as excessive growth of thick, pigmented terminal hairs in androgen-responsive areas (male pattern). Women with chronic hirsutism and menstrual irregularity most likely have PCOS. Elevated serum concentrations of androgens in women most commonly manifest with hirsutism and may also present with acne, androgenetic alopecia, and/or virilization. Hirsutism affects approximately 10% of women. Commonly affected sites include the chin and upper lip, chest, lower abdomen, back, and inner thighs.",
