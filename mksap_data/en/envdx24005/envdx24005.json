Nephrocalcinosis is defined by the deposition of calcium in the kidney parenchyma and tubules, which may be either macroscopic (as seen in this patient) or microscopic. It is the result of excessive excretion of calcium, phosphate, and/or oxalate in the urine with or without hypercalcemia. Severe hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria from primary hyperparathyroidism can lead to volume depletion and acute kidney injury, nephrolithiasis, or nephrocalcinosis.",
