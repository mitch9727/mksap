Neuropathic ulcers are painless, are most common on the plantar surface of the feet, and have associated callus and foot deformity. These types of ulcers typically have a punched-out appearance. The skin is warm and dry with signs of fissuring and breakdown. Neuropathic ulcers arise secondary to repetitive trauma to the skin, typically in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and a reduced awareness of pressure or trauma to the skin.",
