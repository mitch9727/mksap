Compression fractures are characterized by anterior wedging associated with vertebral collapse and irregularity of the vertebral end plates. The clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the presence of a fragility fracture, especially hip or vertebral compression fractures.In another patient's radiograph, asymptomatic vertebral compression fractures resulting in osteoporosis-related height loss and kyphosis are shown. A vertebral endplate depression without loss of vertebral height in upper lumbar vertebrae (unfilled arrows) and severe wedging and height loss of multiple midthoracic vertebral bodies (filled arrows) are shown.",
