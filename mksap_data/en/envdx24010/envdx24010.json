This funduscopic image shows hard exudates, microaneurysms, and minor hemorrhages, findings that represent the early manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. These early changes of diabetic retinopathy are termed nonproliferative, or background, diabetic retinopathy. Although nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy is not typically associated with decline in visual acuity, it is a marker for future development of more significant abnormalities that can lead to vision loss.",
