  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is primary adrenal insufficiency (Option C). Physical examination is helpful in the differentiation of primary (adrenal) from secondary (pituitary) causes of adrenal insufficiency. Although not present in all patients, skin hyperpigmentation is a hallmark feature of primary adrenal insufficiency, which is characterized by an elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone level. Skin hyperpigmentation is caused by stimulation of melanocytes by high levels of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which has the same precursor molecule as adrenocorticotropic hormone. Increased pigmentation is most conspicuous in areas exposed to light and areas exposed to chronic friction or pressure, including the tops of the toes or knuckles, as seen in the patient above.An example of diffuse pigmentation owing to primary adrenal insufficiency in a different patient is shown below.",
