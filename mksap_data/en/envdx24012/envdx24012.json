The patient in this image has a goiter, or enlarged thyroid gland. Patients with goiter should be questioned about compressive symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, dysphagia, and voice changes, which are evident in 10% to 20% of patients with goiter. The presence of hyperthyroid symptoms, eye findings, and goiter in this patient most strongly suggest the diagnosis of Graves disease.",
