  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is a toxic adenoma (Option D). The initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule begins with measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Patients with thyroid nodules and suppressed TSH should undergo thyroid scintigraphy. After a radioactive isotope is administered, the percentage taken up by the thyroid is calculated (radioactive iodine uptake), and an image is obtained (thyroid scan). Autonomously functioning (“hot”) nodules concentrate radioactive iodine to a greater extent than normal thyroid tissue, as seen in this patient's thyroid scan, which shows increased uptake in the right thyroid lobe. Toxic adenomas have a very low risk for malignancy, and biopsy is usually unnecessary unless suspicious ultrasonographic features are present.",
