  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is a toxic multinodular goiter (Option D). This thyroid scan shows “patchy” uptake in an enlarged gland with apparent hyperfunction in the right thyroid lobe. Multinodular goiter is the most common cause of goiter in older adults in the United States, and most goiters are benign. Radioactive iodine thyroid uptake scan is not indicated if the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal. However, if the TSH level is low, radioactive iodine thyroid uptake scan can be performed to confirm the diagnosis of toxic multinodular goiter, which can show patchy and irregular uptake and areas of increased uptake. Thyroid ultrasonography should be performed to evaluate the characteristics of nodules in patients with progressively enlarging goiter, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy should be performed on any suspicious nodules.",
