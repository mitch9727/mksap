They exercise regularly and adhere to a Mediterranean diet. The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at age 68 years. Medications are losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and omeprazole.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.Laboratory studiesTotal cholesterol149 mg/dL (3.86 mmol/L)HDL cholesterol70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)LDL cholesterol55 mg/dL (1.42 mmol/L)Triglycerides120 mg/dL (1.36 mmol/L)The patient's 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is 7.1%.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate preventive measure is to continue the patient's current medications (Option D). Modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) include diet, inactivity, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and overweight and obesity. This patient has a healthy lifestyle, well-controlled hypertension, a borderline cardiovascular event risk, and no additional comorbid conditions. They do not require additional pharmacologic treatment currently and should be encouraged to continue their medications and healthy lifestyle habits.Aspirin (Option A) has historically been recommended for primary prevention of CVD and cerebrovascular disease. However, more recently, three trials, ASPIRE, ASPREE, and ASCEND, demonstrated that low-dose aspirin was not associated with a decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Pooled analyses of 10 studies (with >110,000 patients) showed that low-dose aspirin was associated with a 58% increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding, and an additional cohort analysis of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention showed an increase in intracranial bleeding. Therefore, low-dose aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention in patients at risk for bleeding. In 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of CVD in persons older than 60 years. This patient is older than 60 years and has a history of peptic ulcer disease, which would place them at high bleeding risk. Initiation of low-dose aspirin is inappropriate.The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend shared decision making and risk enhancer assessment for patients at borderline risk (10-year estimated cardiovascular event risk of 5% to <7.5%). Although a discussion of statin therapy would be appropriate, this patient's atherosclerotic CVD risk estimation is 7.1%; therefore, immediate initiation of a statin, such as atorvastatin (Option B), without discussion and risk enhancer assessment would not be appropriate.A systematic review completed for the USPSTF in 2021 found strong evidence that vitamin E supplementation (Option C) demonstrated no benefit in cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality and weak evidence of an increase in hemorrhagic stroke. The USPSTF and ACC/AHA recommend against vitamin E supplementation for primary prevention of CVD.",
