  "question_text": "A 42-year-old woman is evaluated during a routine visit. She gained weight after the birth of each of her two children, 1 and 3 years ago, and now has obesity. She also has a history of gestational diabetes. She wants to get back to her prepregnancy weight because she was informed of her long-term risk for diabetes mellitus. Because she works two jobs, she has limited time to exercise or make healthy meals.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. BMI is 30. Other findings are unremarkable.Laboratory studies:Hemoglobin A1c6.1%H",

  "critique": "The most appropriate statement is “It's great that you'd like to lose weight and lower your risk for diabetes. Let's work on that together” (Option C). Motivational interviewing is predicated on the belief that people have within themselves the means to change their behavior. The clinician's role is to partner with the patient, accept and have compassion for their situation, and guide conversations to help them evoke their own reasons for change, instead of imposing reasons for change on the patient. Motivational interviewing skills that guide rather than direct are represented by OARS: Open-ended questions, Affirmations, Reflections, and Summaries (see Table: Core Skills for Motivational Interviewing). This patient has low confidence that she can change her current behavior. On one hand, she wants to lose weight; on the other hand, she does not have time to exercise or plan her meals. This affirming statement acknowledges her current situation, establishes a partnership, and sets the stage for collaboration as a foundation to explore which method of risk factor modification—therapeutic lifestyle changes or pharmacotherapy—she ultimately feels she is able to engage in.Suggesting that the patient walk during her lunch hour (Option A) is not unreasonable. It is, however, a directive given without first eliciting from the patient what she has already tried and what she can fit into her day.Expressing concern about the patient's risk for diabetes (Option B) is important. However, she is already aware of her risk and wants to lose weight to avoid it; it is less productive to tell her what she already knows. An initial collaborative and supportive stance might help the clinician partner with the patient and increase her willingness to accept recommendations.The patient may benefit from pharmacologic therapy to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes, and as stated earlier, it is important to alert the patient about her risk for diabetes (Option D). However, asking her open-ended questions about what she thinks about her situation and what she feels she can and wants to do is more consistent with the tenets of motivational interviewing. After responses are elicited from the patient, the clinician can proceed to make recommendations that are concordant with her desires and abilities.",
