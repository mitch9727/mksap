  "question_text": "A 75-year-old man is evaluated during a posthospitalization visit for ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction, 20%). During the past year, he has been hospitalized four times for decompensated heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome. He has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. He reports fatigue and is no longer able to perform daily household chores. He expresses sadness regarding his quality of life. He was treated for lung cancer 2 years ago. He also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is receiving maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy including empagliflozin, losartan, carvedilol, furosemide, spironolactone, and atorvastatin.On physical examination, he appears chronically ill. Vital signs are normal. BMI is 23. Cardiac examination reveals an S3 but no jugular venous distention or dependent edema. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.Laboratory studies:Creatinine1.5 mg/dL (132.6 µmol/L)H",

  "critique": "A palliative care consultation (Option C) is the most appropriate management for this chronically ill patient with advanced heart failure. Palliative medicine seeks to relieve suffering and maximize quality of life for patients with serious illnesses. It uses an interdisciplinary team care model with a focus on reducing pain and other physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual symptoms associated with advanced disease. Palliative medicine has been shown to improve overall quality of life, physical symptom burden, mood, and patient and caregiver satisfaction with care. Palliative care also reduces hospitalizations; emergency department use; ICU admissions; and potentially burdensome interventions, such as intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and initiation of dialysis, and is associated with more advance care planning. Although referral to palliative care historically occurred in patients with incurable cancer, early initiation and use during other serious illnesses, such as advanced cardiac, pulmonary, or kidney disease, may be associated with substantial advantages. For this patient with advanced heart failure, a palliative care consultation can clarify his goals of care, assist with complex medical decision making (such as consideration of mechanical circulatory support), and help with symptom management.Hospice provides specialized interdisciplinary care to patients with life-limiting illness for whom disease-directed treatments are no longer effective or desired. Hospice is appropriate for any patient with a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease takes its natural course. Although this patient may have limited life expectancy, a hospice consultation (Option A) is premature without first discussing this option with the patient and gaining a better understanding of his values and goals.Increasing the patient's furosemide dosage (Option B) is not likely to improve his symptoms. This patient is on maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy, and he does not have signs of volume overload on examination.This patient is not a candidate for heart transplantation (Option D) based on his age and recent lung cancer. Most centers have an age cutoff of 65 to 70 years. Additionally, with the exception of skin cancer, most programs require that a patient be cancer-free for at least 5 years before a heart transplant can be considered.",
