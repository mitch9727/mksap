Adults aged 50 years or older and adults 19 to 49 years with high-risk conditions (see Table: Indications for Pneumococcal Vaccination) should receive pneumococcal vaccination. Patients who have not previously received a pneumococcal vaccine can receive the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20), the 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV21), or the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15). For patients who received PCV15, such as this patient, PPSV23 should be administered at least 1 year later (a minimum interval of 8 weeks is recommended for patients with immunocompromise, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal leak). This patient meets the age criteria for vaccination and should complete her pneumococcal immunization with PPSV23.Adults aged 50 years or older should receive the two-dose recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Option A) administered 2 to 6 months apart. This patient has received both recommended herpes zoster vaccinations, and a third one is not indicated.The tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine (Option B) is not indicated for this patient at this visit. After a primary vaccination series, patients should receive Td or the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine every 10 years. This patient received the Tdap vaccine 5 years ago and will not be due for a Td vaccination until age 77 years.Patients who receive PCV15 should subsequently receive PPSV23; these patients do not require additional vaccination with PCV20 (Option C) or PCV21.This patient is eligible for PPSV23. Therefore, advising that no vaccines are indicated (Option E) is inappropriate.",
