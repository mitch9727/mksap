  "critique": "The colleague should meet with the new physician and advise him to limit patient contact to the clinical setting (Option A). Social media has become ubiquitous and has changed how many people communicate with one another. However, physicians should keep personal social media accounts separate from professional interactions, especially interactions with patients, and they should behave professionally in both their personal and professional spheres. The colleague should explain to the new physician that befriending patients on social media and providing general medical advice to them may lead to confusion between the personal and professional spheres. This type of communication may also create challenges within the physician-patient relationship and between the practice and the patient.Commenting on social media about the inappropriateness of another person's social media presence (Option B) is not the most professional response. The most appropriate course of action in this case is to provide feedback to the new physician in a respectful and private manner.The most appropriate next step in this case is to help the new physician identify and correct the professional misstep of blurring professional and personal boundaries. It is likely that he will appreciate the advice and direction and will alter his behavior accordingly. He should be reported to the director of the practice (Option C) if there is evidence of inappropriate contact with patients on social media despite feedback.Taking no action (Option D) would be inappropriate. The colleague should aim to be helpful to the new physician by helping him understand appropriate patient-physician relationships and should not disregard this situation.",
