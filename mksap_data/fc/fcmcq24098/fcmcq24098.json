  "question_text": "A 72-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for severe left hip and groin pain after a mechanical (ground-level) fall a few hours ago. Medical history is significant for hypertension and retained shrapnel due to an injury while on active military duty many years ago. His only medication is amlodipine.On physical examination, pulse rate is 110/min. Other vital signs are normal. There is pain with flexion of the left hip, and the patient cannot bear weight.Plain radiographs of the left hip are unremarkable.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient with a possible left hip fracture is to obtain a CT scan of the hip (Option C). Patients who present with hip fractures often have groin pain and inability to bear weight. On examination, the affected leg may appear externally rotated and shortened. Plain radiographs are sufficient to confirm a hip fracture in most cases. However, if initial imaging is negative and clinical suspicion remains high, MRI or CT of the affected limb should be pursued. Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion for acute hip fracture despite normal plain radiography findings. This patient retains metal fragments from a past injury, which limits the use of MRI; therefore, CT of the hip is the most appropriate option to further assess for a fracture.This patient cannot walk and demonstrates classic physical examination findings of an acute hip fracture for which further imaging is indicated. Discharging the patient home without additional imaging (Option A) would be inappropriate.A bone scan (Option B) is a potential imaging option to evaluate for a hip fracture when plain radiographs are negative. However, this imaging modality may result in false-negative results in the acute setting because it may take several days for a bone scan to reveal positive findings after a fracture. Likewise, false positives are also relatively common. Because bone scans take more time to complete and are not usually as readily available as CT or MRI, an operative delay may occur if this imaging method is selected.MRI of the hip (Option D) is the preferred test if initial radiographic imaging for hip fracture is negative but clinical suspicion remains high. MRI is associated with almost 100% diagnostic accuracy in the setting of a negative radiograph. This patient, however, has retained metal fragments in his body and is not eligible for MRI; a CT scan of the hip is the best option in this case.",
