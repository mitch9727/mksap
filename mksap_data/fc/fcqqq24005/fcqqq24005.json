  "critique": "No vitamin supplementation (Option D) is indicated to reduce the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in this patient. Although one third of adults in the United States use supplemental vitamins, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin use, including use of antioxidant combinations, in the prevention of ASCVD. This recommendation applies to multivitamin preparations and to single or paired vitamin/nutrient preparations (except β-carotene). Vitamin supplementation should be used in treating known deficiencies or in clinical situations in which it has been shown to be effective, such as folic acid supplementation in pregnant persons to prevent fetal neural tube defects or vitamin B12 supplementation in persons who consume a vegan diet.The USPSTF recommends against the use of β-carotene (Option A) or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.This patient should be advised that, in healthy adults without special nutritional needs, the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the use of multivitamins (Option B) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. Instead, she should continue to exercise regularly and consume a balanced diet that includes nuts, fruits, legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and fish.In two trials, vitamin E plus selenium (Option C) was associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and cannot be recommended to prevent ASCVD.",
