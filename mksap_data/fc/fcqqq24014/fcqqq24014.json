  "question_text": "A 70-year-old man is evaluated before discharge from the hospital after treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. Medical history is significant for mild dementia. The patient lives alone and has a daughter who lives nearby. Remaining in his home is very important to him.The care team recommends that the patient be discharged to a short-term rehabilitation facility to gain strength and prepare for safe return to his home. The patient refuses. Decision-making capacity is assessed, and he can articulate the risks, benefits, and alternatives to short-term rehabilitation as well as understand his current medical condition.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is to discharge this patient home with home care services (Option C). Patients should be presumed legally competent to make medical decisions unless found otherwise by judicial determination. However, in the clinical setting, physicians must frequently determine a patient's decision-making capacity by assessing the patient's ability to understand the relevant information, appreciate the medical consequences of the situation, consider various treatment options, and communicate a choice. Decision-making capacity should be evaluated for each decision to be made, and frequent reassessment is necessary to confirm previous determinations of capacity. Patients with depression or mild dementia may retain decision-making capacity; however, in such circumstances, the capacity assessment should be performed more cautiously, particularly when a decision may result in serious consequences. In this situation, the assessment reveals that the patient demonstrates sufficient capacity to make decisions; thus, he should be discharged home with appropriate services to ensure his safety. This patient's choice is also consistent with his previously expressed wishes, which lends validity to his decision.Cognitive evaluations, such as the Mini–Mental State Examination (Option A), do not assess capacity. These evaluations are used to detect cognitive impairment.This competent and autonomous patient can make his own choices; therefore, the patient's daughter should not be asked to decide on his behalf (Option B).A psychiatric consultation (Option D) is unnecessary to determine a patient's decision-making capacity; any physician can perform this assessment. However, some hospitals may suggest a psychiatric evaluation in high-stakes situations, such as when a patient requests to leave against medical advice.",
