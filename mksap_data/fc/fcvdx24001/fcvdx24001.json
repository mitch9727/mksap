  "critique": "Xerotic dermatitis (Option D), also called asteatotic eczema, xerotic eczema, or eczema craquelé, usually occurs on the anterior shins of older persons with dry skin. The condition is pruritic and causes the skin to become dry and flaky. When xerotic dermatitis is severe, the skin appears erythematous and cracked, with multiple fine fissures that resemble cracks in porcelain, also described as a \"dried riverbed\" appearance. This dermatitis is an isolated finding more common in winter or dry conditions. Aging is the most common cause; rarely, xerotic dermatitis may occur in association with an underlying condition, such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and malignancy, or as an adverse effect of certain drugs (e.g., retinoids, diuretics, antineoplastic agents).",
