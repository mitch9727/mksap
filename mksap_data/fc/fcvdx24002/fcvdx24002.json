There is evidence of bruising and ulceration, which is beyond the nonblanchable redness characteristic of a stage 1 injury and is most compatible with a stage 2 pressure injury. Pressure injuries represent damage to the skin and underlying tissue caused by unrelieved pressure. Pressure injuries may be classified with the use of a staging system (see Table: Classification of Pressure Injuries); advanced stages are characterized by increasing tissue loss, depth, and ulcer size.",
