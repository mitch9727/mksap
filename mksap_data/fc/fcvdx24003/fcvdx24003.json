  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is actinic purpura (Option A). Actinic purpura is characterized by purpuric macules or patches, most commonly on the forearms, that result from minor trauma. It is caused by age-related capillary fragility and bleeding under atrophic skin and is most common in older adults. There may be associated stellate pseudoscars, which are atrophic scars occurring after skin tears. Sun protection is recommended to prevent further skin damage. In addition to actinic purpura, this patient also has solar lentigines, which are flat, pigmented areas caused by sun exposure.",
