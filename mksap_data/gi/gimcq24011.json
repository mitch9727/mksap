  "question_text": "A 58-year-old woman is evaluated for progressive gastroesophageal reflux disease and occasional dysphagia. She has systemic sclerosis complicated by interstitial lung disease and digital ulcers. She has implemented lifestyle changes, including staying upright after eating and avoiding provocative foods. Medications are famotidine and mycophenolate mofetil.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. She has facial telangiectasias, sclerodactyly, digital pitting with ulceration, and acro-osteolysis of the hands.Upper endoscopy shows erosive esophagitis and a normal stomach and duodenum. Esophageal biopsy specimens are normal.Esophageal manometry shows absent contractility and normal lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management is pantoprazole (Option D). Systemic sclerosis can sometimes result in absent esophageal contractility, which is characterized by 100% failed peristalsis in the presence of normal lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, as seen on esophageal manometry. Patients with systemic sclerosis are at risk for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) because of esophageal dysmotility, typically weak peristalsis or aperistalsis, and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Systemic sclerosis can also cause decreased gastric motility. These physiologic changes can lead to more severe GERD and decreased esophageal clearance of refluxed material. Treatment of absent esophageal contractility and GERD is focused on lifestyle changes, including eating upright and remaining upright for hours after meals; eating frequent, small meals; eating slowly; and avoiding certain solid textures. Medical therapy includes acid-reducing agents for GERD (H2-receptor antagonist and proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) and low-dose antidepressants to reduce chest discomfort. Notably, prokinetic agents are not recommended. This patient has systemic sclerosis with symptoms of reflux and dysphagia. Although she has reflux treated with an H2-receptor antagonist, upper endoscopy showed erosive esophagitis. In addition, manometry showed absent contractility. The next step in the management of this patient includes optimizing acid suppression with a PPI. Rarely, pathologic acid reflux persists despite high-dose PPI therapy.This patient has erosive esophagitis and absent esophageal contractility; medical management with a PPI should be optimized. In patients with systemic sclerosis, antireflux surgery (Option A) is not recommended because, in the setting of absent esophageal contractility, postoperative dysphagia may occur.Botulinum toxin injection into the lower esophageal sphincter (Option B) is a treatment for achalasia, an esophageal motility disorder characterized by complete lack of normal peristalsis of the esophageal body and high pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter. This treatment aims to decrease the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. In patients with systemic sclerosis, this treatment is inappropriate because the lower esophageal sphincter pressure is already decreased as part of the disease pathology.Metoclopramide (Option C) is a prokinetic agent that may improve gastric emptying in the setting of gastroparesis. However, it is not a recommended treatment for absent contractility or GERD.",
