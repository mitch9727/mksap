  "question_text": "A 28-year-old woman is evaluated for a 4-week history of three to four bloody bowel movements daily and associated lower abdominal cramping relieved by stool passage. She reports no fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. She does not use NSAIDs and has no history of recent antibiotic use, travel, or sick contacts.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The abdomen is nondistended. There is mild left-sided abdominal tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. Anorectal examination reveals a small amount of bloody mucus.Laboratory studies show normal complete blood count, C-reactive protein level, and stool pathogen panel.Colonoscopy with biopsy confirms active mild left-sided ulcerative colitis.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient with mild left-sided ulcerative colitis (UC) is oral mesalamine and mesalamine enemas (Option C). Ulcerative colitis typically presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal discomfort, the severity of which is related to the extent and degree of inflammation. The distribution of UC is generally divided into proctitis (involving the rectum only), left-sided colitis (inflammation that does not extend beyond the splenic flexure), and extensive colitis (inflammation extending beyond the splenic flexure). Treatment depends on the extent and severity of inflammation (see Figure: Treatment Framework for Ulcerative Colitis). This patient's stool passage frequency, intermittent hematochezia, normal complete blood count and C-reactive protein level, and normal vital signs categorize her disease as mild. Colonoscopy revealed mucosal inflammatory changes involving the left side of the colon. 5-Aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide, and delayed- and controlled-release mesalamine) are the mainstay of treatment for mild to moderate UC. Mesalamine given orally or topically is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in UC. American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines recommend combined mesalamine therapy (oral and enemas) for induction of remission in mild to moderate left-sided UC, because it is superior to oral mesalamine alone.The anti–tumor necrosis factor agent infliximab (Option A) would not be indicated for this patient with mild, left-sided UC. Infliximab is effective for inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe UC. In patients such as this with mild disease, biologic treatment is reserved for those who do not achieve remission with mesalamine treatment.Mesalamine suppositories (Option B) are effective for induction of remission in patients with ulcerative proctitis. However, this treatment is not appropriate as monotherapy for this patient with left-sided disease.Oral glucocorticoids, such as prednisone (Option D), are commonly used to treat moderate to severe UC and are effective in inducing remission. However, glucocorticoids are not effective as maintenance therapy and have significant adverse effects. Oral prednisone would not be indicated given this patient's mild disease severity and the likelihood of response to mesalamine.",
