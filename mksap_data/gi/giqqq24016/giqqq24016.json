  "question_text": "A 50-year-old woman is evaluated for worsening heartburn symptoms. She reports no weight loss, dysphagia, vomiting, or diarrhea. She takes calcium carbonate as needed for the heartburn symptoms, which achieves complete resolution. One month ago, after evaluation for symptoms of dyspepsia, she completed treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection with optimized bismuth quadruple therapy. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. She currently takes no other medication.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate test to perform next in this patient is a 13C-urea breath test (Option B). Persons treated for Helicobacter pylori infection should undergo testing to confirm eradication at least 4 weeks after completion of therapy, with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy cessation for 2 weeks before testing. H. pylori eradication can be evaluated by using a 13C-urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or gastric biopsy during an indicated upper endoscopy. One month after completion of treatment for H. pylori, this patient presents with worsening heartburn symptoms. As many as 15% of patients have worsening reflux esophagitis following eradication of H. pylori. It is thought that this is because of increased gastric acid secretion following eradication; however, eradication should be confirmed in this patient with testing.A barium esophagram (Option A) may show reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus but is not needed for this patient based on her response to calcium carbonate and low likelihood of anatomic abnormality (age less than 60 years and absence of alarm symptoms).Hydrogen breath testing (Option C) is used to evaluate for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which typically presents with bloating and diarrhea. These symptoms are not present in this patient, so evaluation for bacterial overgrowth is not necessary.The American College of Gastroenterology/Canadian Association of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend against the routine use of upper endoscopy (Option D) in patients younger than 60 years with dyspepsia, even in most patients with alarm features (weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, and vomiting). Endoscopy may be necessary if the patient's symptoms progress; however, it not needed at this time, because the increase in heartburn symptoms is a recognized complication of H. pylori treatment.",
