Pneumomediastinum (air within the mediastinal space) is shown in the image below by the presence of hyperlucent areas (white arrows) surrounding and making more prominent the contours of mediastinal structures, such as the border of the heart and aorta. The air has laterally displaced the mediastinal pleura, which can be seen on the frontal radiograph (left panel) as a long linear opacity (white arrowheads). Subcutaneous emphysema (air within the soft tissues) is also seen (yellow arrow).",
