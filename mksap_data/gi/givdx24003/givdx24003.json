Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by grouped, pruritic, erythematous papulovesicles and erosions that typically occur over the extensor surfaces of the arms, legs, central back, buttocks, and scalp. Because of intense pruritus, erosions and excoriations are the most common clinical finding, as shown in the image below of a different patient.Almost all patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have histologic evidence of celiac disease, but gastrointestinal symptoms occur in only about 25% of patients.",
