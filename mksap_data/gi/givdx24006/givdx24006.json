The macroscopic findings of EoE on endoscopy are nonspecific, but mucosal longitudinal furrowing, esophageal rings, exudates, and mucosal friability has been consistently described. EoE can occur at any age but is most common in children and in adults in the third and fourth decades of life. EoE is more commonly seen in males. Patients often have other atopic conditions, such as asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, and seasonal or food allergies.",
