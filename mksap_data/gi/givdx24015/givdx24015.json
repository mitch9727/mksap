Diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging because hallmark anatomic features, such as pancreatic calcifications, occur in only 25% of patients, and other features of atrophy or duct dilation can occur normally with aging or other disease processes. Imaging with CT or MRI is the initial test of choice.",
