  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is chronic pancreatitis (Option B), as evidenced by chronic coarse calcifications distributed in the body and tail of the pancreas on the frontal plane CT scan. Diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging because hallmark anatomic features, such as pancreatic calcifications, occur in only 25% of patients, and other features of atrophy or duct dilation can occur normally with aging or other disease processes. Imaging with CT or MRI is the initial test of choice.",
