Characteristic imaging findings of AIP include a narrowed main pancreatic duct and parenchymal swelling (“sausage-shaped” pancreas) as shown (arrows). Fulfillment of one or more of the HISORt criteria (diagnostic Histology, suggestive Imaging, Serology with elevated serum IgG4, Other organ involvement, and Response to therapy with glucocorticoids) can be helpful in the diagnosis of type 1 AIP. Patients with type 1 AIP also have elevated levels of IgG4-positive cells in pancreatic tissue (>10 IgG4-positive cells/hpf), and 60% to 80% of patients have associated sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing sialadenitis, or retroperitoneal fibrosis.",
