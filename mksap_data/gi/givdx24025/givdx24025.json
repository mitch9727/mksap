Erythema nodosum most commonly presents as a single or multiple tender, erythematous nodules on extensor surfaces of the lower extremities, as in this case. Other conditions associated with erythema nodosum include streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, and pregnancy. Medications, such as oral contraceptives, may also cause erythema nodosum.
