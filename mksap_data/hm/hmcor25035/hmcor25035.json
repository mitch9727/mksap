Medical history is noncontributory, and she takes no medication.On physical examination, temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), and pulse rate is 125/min; other vital signs are normal.

  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Option D). TTP is caused by an acquired deficiency in ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers. In the absence of ADAMTS13 activity, these multimers form platelet-rich microthrombi in vessels and ultimately lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and resultant end-organ damage. Patients with TTP often present with three or more of the classic pentad of fever, MAHA, thrombocytopenia, kidney dysfunction, and neurologic dysfunction; however, TTP is unlikely in the absence of MAHA and thrombocytopenia. An ADAMTS13 level less than 10% supports the diagnosis of TTP, but the PLASMIC score (Table: PLASMIC Score) is useful in guiding diagnosis while awaiting ADAMTS13 level results. The differential diagnosis for TTP most prominently includes hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is suggested by a preceding diarrheal illness and more severe kidney dysfunction. TTP is associated with a high mortality rate, and therapeutic plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma and empiric glucocorticoids should be started before laboratory confirmation of ADAMTS13 deficiency (completed on pretreatment blood) is available. This patient has MAHA, evidenced by an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, undetectably low haptoglobin level, a negative direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test result, and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, as shown. The combination of MAHA, thrombocytopenia, fever, and kidney dysfunction in this patient strongly suggests the diagnosis of TTP.Aplastic anemia (AA) is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by pancytopenia and reduced bone marrow cellularity (Option A). Although this patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, the leukocyte count is normal. Furthermore, the anemia of AA is hypoproliferative rather than the MAHA seen in this patient.Classic laboratory findings of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Option B) include MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The absence of coagulopathy in this patient as evidenced by the normal INR and activated partial thromboplastin time makes DIC unlikely.Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (Option C) is caused by autoantibodies to platelet surface membranes, and laboratory findings are typically limited to a low platelet count. ITP may occur concomitantly with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Evans syndrome), but it does not present with MAHA as seen in this patient.",
