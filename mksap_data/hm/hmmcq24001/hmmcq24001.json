  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with kidney disease in the setting of multiple myeloma (MM) is a kidney biopsy (Option B). Kidney impairment in MM is defined by a serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dL (177 μmol/L) or creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min. The two main causes of kidney disease in MM are hypercalcemia and cast nephropathy; light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis are less common causes. Cast nephropathy occurs when immunoglobulin light chains produced by monoclonal plasma cells are insufficiently reabsorbed in the proximal tubules and aggregate with protein in the distal tubules, causing tubular and interstitial damage. Cast nephropathy can also cause the nephrotic syndrome. The presence of cast nephropathy makes patients vulnerable to additional kidney injury, especially with volume depletion or exposure to NSAIDs or iodinated contrast. Diagnosis of cast nephropathy is often made clinically, but kidney biopsy may be required, particularly in patients without proteinuria or other potential causes such as diabetes mellitus. This patient has kidney damage in the setting of MM and poorly controlled diabetes. A kidney biopsy is advisable to determine the cause.Abdominal fat pad biopsy (Option A) is an appropriate test when AL amyloidosis is suspected, especially as a low-risk alternative to kidney or endomyocardial biopsy. Although this patient has IgG-kappa myeloma, no cardiac disease is evident, and the bone marrow biopsy shows no evidence of amyloid, making AL amyloidosis unlikely.99m-Technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy (Option C) is positive in patients with transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) amyloidosis and helps distinguish this entity from cardiac AL amyloidosis. This patient has no evidence of cardiac disease and scintigraphy is not indicated.Performing no further testing (Option D) is not the most appropriate course of action for this patient. They have significant kidney dysfunction with several possible causes, including diabetes and myeloma cast nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to establish the cause and determine the treatment plan.",

Medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications are losartan and insulin.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Mild pallor is noted. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation show an IgG monoclonal protein spike of 1.5 g/dL (15 g/L). Bone marrow biopsy reveals 50% clonal plasma cells without Congo red staining.Echocardiogram is normal with an ejection fraction of 58%. Kidney ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis.",
