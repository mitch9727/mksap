  "critique": "The most appropriate test to perform next in this patient with likely light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is an abdominal fat pad biopsy (Option A). AL amyloidosis is a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the production of amyloidogenic free light chains. These light chains can deposit in various organs, including the kidney, heart, skin, and tongue. A myriad of presentations is possible, including the nephrotic syndrome, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, macroglossia, and hepatomegaly. Skin manifestations are present in 30% to 40% of patients and include easy bruising with minor pressure (pinch purpura), periorbital yellow waxy papules and plaques, and dystrophic nails. Diagnosis usually requires biopsy of the affected organ showing characteristic extracellular amyloid deposits, with apple green birefringence with Congo red staining. Initial abdominal fat pad or bone marrow biopsy may be preferred to avoid more invasive biopsies of affected organs such as the kidney and heart. After amyloid is confirmed in tissue, mass spectrometry or other techniques will determine the amyloid type, such as AL, transthyretin, or amyloid A protein. This patient has clinical findings of the nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, peripheral edema) and cardiac amyloid (myocardium with speckled appearance on echocardiogram and late gadolinium enhancement on MRI). The increase in free lambda light chains suggests an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia and AL amyloidosis. Abdominal fat pad biopsy or bone marrow biopsy are the least invasive means of establishing the diagnosis.Endomyocardial biopsy (Option B) would likely show myocardial amyloid deposition and establish the diagnosis of amyloidosis. However, cardiac biopsy is associated with significant risk, and a lower-risk test such as abdominal fat pad biopsy or bone marrow biopsy is more appropriate.Kidney biopsy (Option C) will likely reveal amyloidosis as the cause of nephrotic syndrome; however, a biopsy of this site poses more risk and should generally be considered for the diagnosis of amyloidosis only when safer sites, such as the bone marrow or abdominal fat pad, are unrevealing.99m-Technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy (Option D) is useful in detecting myocardial transthyretin amyloid, which is the most common form of amyloid affecting the myocardium. This scan is not indicated in evaluating patients with suspected amyloidosis who have laboratory features suggesting a light chain cause.",
