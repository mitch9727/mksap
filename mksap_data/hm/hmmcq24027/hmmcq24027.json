  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is babesiosis (Option A), which is caused by the intraerythrocytic protozoan Babesia microti. It is primarily transmitted by the black-legged deer tick and therefore occurs in areas where Lyme disease is endemic, including the Northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States. Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis may result in infections outside of endemic regions. Symptoms are often nonspecific and include fever, fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and cough, typically beginning 1 month after a tick bite. Physical examination may reveal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The hallmark of babesiosis is hemolytic anemia; severe disease may include thrombocytopenia, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and acute kidney injury. The characteristic finding of babesiosis is the presence of the intraerythrocytic tetrad resembling a Maltese cross () on the peripheral blood smear. Polymerase chain reaction testing can be diagnostic if babesiosis infection is suspected but the peripheral blood smear is unrevealing. First-line treatment for babesiosis is atovaquone plus azithromycin; exchange transfusion may be indicated in those with severe infection. This patient has anemia with a decreased serum haptoglobin level and an increased serum lactate dehydrogenase level, suggesting hemolysis. The presence of intraerythrocytic tetrads on the peripheral blood smear in a patient who resides in an endemic area makes babesiosis the most likely diagnosis.Although malaria (Option B) and babesiosis have many similarities, malarial infections acquired in the United States are rare. This patient has not traveled to an area of malaria endemicity, but he does reside in an area where babesiosis is present. The erythrocyte inclusions seen on the peripheral blood smear also suggest babesiosis rather than malaria.Although hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Option C), TTP causes a microangiopathic erythrocyte destruction, and fragmented erythrocytes or schistocytes are seen on the peripheral blood smear. Intraerythrocytic inclusions are also inconsistent with TTP.This patient's negative direct antiglobulin test makes warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) unlikely (Option D). Additionally, the peripheral blood smear in a patient with WAIHA would reveal spherocytes rather than intraerythrocytic inclusions.",

Medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications.On physical examination, temperature is 39.2 °C (102.6 °F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, pulse rate is 112/min, and respiration rate is 16/min. Palpation reveals a mildly enlarged liver.
