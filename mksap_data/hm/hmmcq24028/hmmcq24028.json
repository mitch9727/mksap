He currently feels well and reports no symptoms. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs and other findings are normal.Genetic testing is positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation.",

  "critique": "No treatment other than aspirin (Option D) is needed for this patient with essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a clonal stem cell process associated with a sustained increased platelet count. Leukocytosis can also accompany an increased platelet count in some patients. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in 50% to 60% of patients with ET; 25% to 35% have the CAL-R mutation, and 5% have the MPL mutation. The major risk of ET is the development of thrombotic complications. Treatment for ET may include aspirin and cytoreductive therapy, most commonly with hydroxyurea. Patients with an underlying JAK2 V617F mutation are at greater risk of developing thrombotic complications than those with other mutations seen with ET, and low-dose aspirin is recommended in patients who are JAK2 positive. Aspirin is indicated in patients older than 60 years regardless of JAK2 mutation status and in those with vasomotor symptoms (headache or erythromelalgia). Cytoreductive therapy and aspirin are also indicated in patients older than 60 years or those with a history of thromboembolism. Patients younger than 60 years who are not JAK2 positive or do not have a history of thrombosis can be monitored without aspirin or cytoreductive therapy. This patient has ET based on the presence of sustained thrombocytosis and the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation. Aspirin should be started, but he does not meet criteria for cytoreductive therapy. However, regular surveillance, including laboratory evaluation, is recommended to monitor for progression of ET, and additional treatment may eventually be required.Hydroxyurea (Option A) is commonly used to decrease the platelet count and reduce thrombotic complications in patients with high-risk ET. This patient is younger than 60 years and has no history of thrombotic disease. He is not considered high risk, and cytoreductive therapy is not indicated.Imatinib (Option B) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR::ABL oncoprotein seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It results in excellent long-term control of CML, improved survival, and a decreased need for hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, but it is not indicated in the treatment of ET.Ruxolitinib (Option C) is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that has been shown to reduce spleen volume and symptom burden in patients with polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. It is not indicated for use in ET.",
  "key_points": [
    "Patients with essential thrombocythemia who are at low risk (age <60 years, JAK2 negative, no venous or arterial thrombosis) can be monitored without therapy.",
    "Cytoreductive therapy is indicated for patients with essential thrombocythemia who are older than 60 years or have a history of thromboembolism."
