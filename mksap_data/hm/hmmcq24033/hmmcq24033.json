Type 1 vWD is characterized by quantitatively low levels (<30%) of normally functioning vWF. It is diagnosed by a low vWF antigen level with or without decreased activity. Mucocutaneous bleeding is common. The activated partial thromboplastin time may be prolonged because vWF normally protects factor VIII from degradation. Desmopressin causes release of preformed vWF and factor VIII from endothelial cells and is effective in patients with type 1 vWD with bleeding. It is typically used for mild to moderate bleeding or before minor invasive procedures (e.g., dental procedures). This patient, who has significant menorrhagia, should be treated with desmopressin. Longer-term treatment with either antifibrinolytic therapy (e.g., tranexamic acid) or hormonal contraception should also be considered.Cryoprecipitate (Option A) contains concentrated amounts of vWF and was previously the treatment of choice when desmopressin was ineffective or contraindicated. However, vWF concentrate is a more effective and safer option, and it has supplanted the use of cryoprecipitate. Regardless, this patient should receive desmopressin as first-line therapy.Administration of vWF concentrate (Option C) is not necessary in this patient. vWF concentrate is indicated in patients with type 1 vWD with severe and potentially life-threatening bleeding. vWF concentrates are also appropriate to treat bleeding in patients with type 2B vWD (characterized by an enhanced binding of high-molecular-weight vWF fragments to platelet receptors) and type 3 vWD (severe deficiency) for whom desmopressin is contraindicated or ineffective. This patient with type 1 vWD and non–life-threatening bleeding should be treated with desmopressin before vWF concentrate is considered.Observation (Option D) is not the best option in this patient because she has significant menorrhagia with resultant iron deficiency anemia. Although some patients with bleeding and vWD who are anemic or mildly anemic can be observed, this patient should be treated with desmopressin.",
