  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient with spontaneous bleeding in the setting of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is acquired hemophilia A (Option A). Acquired hemophilia A results from an autoantibody directed against factor VIII, leading to profound functional deficiency. Patients initially have severe and potentially life-threatening bleeding from mucosal sites, large hematomas and ecchymoses, and sometimes postsurgical bleeding. Unlike inherited hemophilia A, hemarthroses are rare. Approximately half of all cases are associated with pregnancy, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. Laboratory features include a prolonged aPTT and a normal prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count. Mixing studies do not correct the aPTT, and factor analysis shows a low factor VIII level. Management usually involves plasma derivatives that bypass the inhibited factor, such as activated factor VII, and long-term immunosuppression. This older patient has spontaneous bleeding in the neck and flank, a prolonged aPTT, and a normal PT. Acquired hemophilia A is the most likely diagnosis.Liver disease (Option B) results in procoagulant and anticoagulant factor reduction. This often results in prolongation of PT and aPTT; however, these results do not correlate with bleeding risk because they do not reflect the parallel reduction in anticoagulant factors. This patient has a normal PT and no clinical evidence of liver disease.Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Option C) usually occurs in patients with severe sepsis, disseminated malignancy, or multisystem organ failure. Laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, a prolonged PT and aPTT, a low plasma fibrinogen level, and an elevated D-dimer level. Other than a prolonged aPTT, this patient has none of the findings of DIC.von Willebrand disease (vWD) (Option D) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or qualitative defects of von Willebrand factor. vWD tends to cause mucocutaneous bleeding similar to that seen in thrombocytopenia. Although an acquired form of vWD exists, it usually presents early in life. An older patient presenting with spontaneous hematoma formation is unlikely to have vWD.",

  "question_text": "A 76-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency department for fullness and discomfort in his left lateral neck. He reports no dysphagia or dyspnea. Medical history is significant for an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 2 years ago. He also has hypertension and dyslipidemia, which are managed with amlodipine and atorvastatin. He reports no recent trauma, and he has no personal or family history of bleeding disorders.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. There is fullness in the left lateral neck and supraclavicular area without lymphadenopathy. Ecchymoses are noted on the right flank.CT scan of the head and neck demonstrates a large hematoma in the lateral neck without impingement on the airway.",
