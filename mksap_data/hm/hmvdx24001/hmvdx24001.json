  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is protein C deficiency (Option B). Protein C is a vitamin K–dependent protein that degrades activated factors V and VIII and has an anticoagulant effect. Protein C deficiency increases the risk of thrombotic events and pregnancy morbidity, often manifesting before age 50 years, particularly in individuals with a strong family history of thrombosis. The half-life of protein C is shorter than many of the other vitamin K–dependent proteins. When warfarin is initiated in patients with protein C deficiency, warfarin-induced thrombotic skin necrosis can result from rapid depletion of protein C, with a subsequent transient hypercoagulable state following the loss of the anticoagulant effect of protein C.",
