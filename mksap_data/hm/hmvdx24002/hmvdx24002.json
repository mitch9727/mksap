  "critique": "This patient most likely has multiple myeloma (Option B). Increased levels of serum proteins, such as the monoclonal immunoglobulins associated with multiple myeloma, will cause rouleaux formation, or stacking of the erythrocytes, as shown.This “stacked-coin” appearance (arrow) of the erythrocytes can be seen in any condition associated with increased plasma proteins, including polyclonal or monoclonal gammopathies. The combined presence of anemia, hypercalcemia, and rouleaux formation strongly suggests multiple myeloma. Erythrocyte agglutination may occur with cold agglutinin disease, but hypercalcemia is not a feature of this disease.",
