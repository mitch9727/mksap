They may be seen in hereditary spherocytosis and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In this patient, the family history of anemia and the presence of splenomegaly are most compatible with hereditary spherocytosis. The larger and lighter pink cells seen on this peripheral blood smear are reticulocytes (blue arrow).",
