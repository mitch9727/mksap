Echinocytes are erythrocytes with relatively few spicules of uniform size and distribution that project from the cell surface (black arrows). They appear contracted and dense on stained peripheral blood smears. Echinocytes are most characteristically associated with uremia and liver disease but may also be an artifact of preparing the peripheral blood smear. Echinocytes are often confused with acanthocytes, but the projections of echinocytes are smaller, more uniform, and more uniformly distributed than those of acanthocytes.",
