  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is sideroblastic anemia. This bone marrow examination is remarkable for the presence of ringed sideroblasts (arrow) (Option C). These cells are erythroid precursor cells with small, blue-staining, iron-containing granules arranged in a ring around the nucleus. Ringed sideroblasts are associated with a variety of disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and hyperferremia. Sideroblastic anemia may be congenital or acquired. Causes of the acquired form include myelodysplastic syndrome, alcohol use disorder, copper deficiency, lead toxicity, or the use of certain drugs (such as linezolid and isoniazid).",
