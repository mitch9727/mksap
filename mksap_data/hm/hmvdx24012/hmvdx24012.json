  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is thrombocytopenia causing petechiae (Option C). Petechiae are round, discrete, hemorrhagic areas typically less than 2 mm in diameter. They are often caused by dermal hemorrhage resulting from thrombocytopenia. As the lesions age and the hemoglobin is metabolized, the color changes from bright red to green to yellow and then fades. Petechiae do not blanch with pressure and are flat and nontender.",
