  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (Option D). TRALI is characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs within 6 hours of transfusion; hypoxemia, fever, and hypotension may also occur. The overt signs of volume overload seen in patients with transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), the most common serious complication of blood product transfusion, are not present. Radiographic findings usually suggest a noncardiac pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome and may resemble those seen in TACO. This patient with fever, hypotension, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates shortly after receiving a blood transfusion likely has TRALI.",
