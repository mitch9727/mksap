In this smear, they are significantly smaller, indicating microcytosis. In addition to the microcytosis, this peripheral blood smear illustrates the other most common findings associated with iron deficiency anemia: hypochromia (increase in the central pallor of cells, black arrow), poikilocytosis (changes in erythrocyte shape, blue arrows), and anisocytosis (changes in erythrocyte size).",
