The presence of macroglossia strongly suggests AL amyloidosis. Skin manifestations are present in 30% to 40% of patients and include generalized waxy appearance; easy bruising with minor pressure (pinch purpura); violaceous discoloration around the eyes (“raccoon eyes”); yellow waxy papules and plaques, especially in a periorbital location; and dystrophic nails.",
