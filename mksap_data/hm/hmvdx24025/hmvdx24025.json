  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis (Option B). The presence of periorbital purpura (\"raccoon eyes\") is not very sensitive but is highly specific for AL amyloidosis. This finding is often elicited by a Valsalva maneuver or minor trauma. AL amyloidosis is a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by production of amyloidogenic lambda or kappa free light chains. These light chains can deposit in various organs, resulting in the clinical presentations of the disease, including skin changes, kidney disease, and cardiac disease.",
