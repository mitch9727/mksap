  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) (Option C). Up to 2% of patients treated with heparin develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and it is most common in surgical patients. Approximately 30% of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia develop HITT. In patients with HITT, venous thrombi occur two to four times more often than do arterial thrombi, although in patients with underlying arterial disease, this ratio is reversed. Thrombi have a propensity to form in areas of vascular damage, such as in vessels in which indwelling catheters have been placed, as in this patient.",
