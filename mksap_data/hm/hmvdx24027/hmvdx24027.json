This patient's bone marrow aspirate shows the presence of many violet granules (black arrow) in the cytoplasm and a high nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio. Granulation of the promyelocytes may be subtle, giving the cells a “dusky” appearance. Folded nuclei and clusters of Auer rods (red arrow) are also noted. These findings are consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia.",
