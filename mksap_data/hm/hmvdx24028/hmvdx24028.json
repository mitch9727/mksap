Lytic lesions are found in nearly 60% of patients with multiple myeloma and most frequently involve the vertebral bodies, skull, thoracic cage, pelvis, and proximal humeral and femoral bones. In contrast, bone lesions in metastatic prostate cancer and Paget disease tend to have significant osteoblastic changes, whereas osteomyelitis is marked by periosteal reaction and bone destruction.",
