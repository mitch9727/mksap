This patient's large area of jaggedly branching, angulated retiform purpura is a manifestation of intravascular clot formation in the small vessels of the skin, leading to overlying skin necrosis. Angulated retiform purpura can be the presenting manifestation of APLAS. A further clue to the presence of APLAS is prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time, as seen with this patient.",
