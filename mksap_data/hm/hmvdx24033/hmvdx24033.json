  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary embolism (Option D). This patient's ECG demonstrates an S1Q3T3 pattern (prominent S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in lead III), which suggests pulmonary embolism. Although the ECG is of limited usefulness for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, abnormalities historically considered to support the diagnosis include an S1Q3T3 pattern, right ventricular strain, and new right bundle branch block (incomplete or complete). The most common ECG finding associated with pulmonary embolism is sinus tachycardia, but this is a nonspecific abnormality.",
