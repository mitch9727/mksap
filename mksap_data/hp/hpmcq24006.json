  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Option B). HCC is the most common liver tumor in patients with cirrhosis. Common risk factors for HCC include all causes of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis (especially untreated hepatitis). Patients with known cirrhosis should undergo screening and surveillance for HCC (see Table: Populations Recommended for HCC Screening and Surveillance) with liver ultrasonography and α-fetoprotein measurement every 6 months. In patients with cirrhosis who have a solid liver mass and an elevated α-fetoprotein level, such as this patient, HCC is the most likely diagnosis. Multiphasic liver CT or MRI is often diagnostic, but a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis in indeterminate cases. This patient has cirrhosis and treatment-naive hepatitis B virus infection, both of which increase his risk for primary liver cancer, most commonly HCC.Focal nodular hyperplasia (Option A) is a benign liver lesion that represents a proliferation of hepatocytes around a central vascular scar. It is more commonly seen in women and in patients without a history of chronic liver disease. It is uncommon in the setting of cirrhosis and is therefore an unlikely diagnosis in this patient.Metastatic colon cancer (Option C) is unlikely in this case. Because of the patient's underlying cirrhosis, a solid liver mass is more likely to be HCC than metastatic colon cancer. In addition, his normal colonoscopy findings 4 years ago decrease the likelihood of a colon cancer metastasis.Cystic lesions of the liver can occur and are often benign. However, this patient's lesion does not have a cystic appearance, making the diagnosis of a solitary hepatic cyst (Option D) less likely. This patient has a solid-appearing mass on both ultrasound and MRI, which is more suggestive of HCC.",
