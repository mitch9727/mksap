Glucocorticoids were initiated on hospitalization, and he is responding appropriately to therapy. He is also taking mesalamine.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.Laboratory studies:Platelet count450,000/µL (450 × 109/L)Alkaline phosphatase400 U/LHMRI of the patient's abdomen shows a 2.2-cm indeterminate liver mass concerning for malignancy as well as features of sclerosing cholangitis, including ductal dilatations. There is no evidence of cirrhosis.Colonoscopy shows findings of active ulcerative colitis but no mass.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in management is liver mass tissue sampling (Option B). Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis are associated with an increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a primary liver malignancy arising from the biliary epithelium. The incidence of intrahepatic CCA has been increasing, with survival rates of approximately 20% at 5 years. The appearance of CCA on multiphasic CT or MRI often varies, and histology is needed to confirm the diagnosis before initiation of treatment. This patient with PSC and ulcerative colitis is presenting with a solid liver lesion that should be evaluated with tissue sampling. Other liver lesions that may present in this patient include hemangioma, adenoma, solitary metastasis, or hepatocellular carcinoma; however, his history of PSC raises a higher suspicion for CCA.This patient first needs a biopsy to diagnose CCA before treatment is considered. Establishing whether the mass is benign or malignant is the next step; in the case of malignancy, staging and then treatment would proceed after diagnosis. Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma should be considered for discussion by a multidisciplinary tumor board. If possible, patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma should be considered for surgical resection (Option D) followed by adjuvant capecitabine. Chemotherapy may be offered to patients who are not candidates for surgical therapy (Option A). Those with early-stage disease in the setting of cirrhosis may be candidates for liver transplantation (Option C).",
