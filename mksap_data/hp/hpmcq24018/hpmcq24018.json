  "critique": "The most appropriate management for this patient is hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) monitoring (Option B). There are four phases of chronic HBV infection, including the immune-control (inactive carrier) phase. Patients in the immune-control phase have a low risk for spontaneous reactivation; thus, periodic monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA is recommended every 6 to 12 months, or sooner if there are symptoms that suggest hepatitis. In addition, the presence of liver fibrosis should be assessed because patients in the immune-control phase may have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. This patient has chronic HBV infection based on a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) result. (Patients with acute HBV also have positivity for HBsAg, but this patient's findings do not suggest an acute infection.) She is in the immune-control phase based on a normal ALT, negativity for HBeAg, positivity for HBe antibody, and low HBV DNA level (<2000 IU/mL). She does not have clinical evidence of cirrhosis (normal platelet count, low Fibrosis-4 score, and no ultrasonographic evidence of portal hypertension). To monitor for reactivation, she should undergo periodic HBV DNA and ALT testing.This patient does not require screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with ultrasonography and α-fetoprotein measurement (Option A). Patients with cirrhosis of any cause should be offered screening if they are eligible for and would benefit from HCC treatment. In addition, guidelines recommend that some patients with chronic HBV infection be offered HCC screening even if they do not have cirrhosis (see Table: Populations Recommended for HCC Screening and Surveillance). This patient does not have cirrhosis and does not meet these criteria.Beginning antiviral therapy with tenofovir (Option C) or entecavir is not indicated. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated if they are in the immune-active or reactivation phase. Patients in the immune-control phase should be treated if they have cirrhosis because liver decompensation may occur in the event of reactivation.Reassurance (Option D) is not appropriate because patients in the immune-control phase have a small risk for spontaneous reactivation and thus should be monitored with periodic HBV DNA and ALT testing.",
