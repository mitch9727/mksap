  "critique": "A diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) requires immediate referral to a liver transplant center (Option D). ALF is defined as severe acute (illness duration <26 weeks) liver injury associated with hepatic encephalopathy and impaired liver synthetic function (usually based on an abnormally elevated INR) in a patient without preexisting liver disease. The prompt recognition of ALF is essential because of high rates of mortality. Early signs of hepatic encephalopathy may include the following:Disordered sleepImpaired attentionMood lability or other personality changes that may be apparent only to close friends and relativesLiver transplantation improves the survival rate; therefore, in patients such as this one, referral to a liver transplant center is essential when ALF is recognized. The main causes of death in ALF are multisystem organ failure and sepsis.Sedatives should generally be avoided in the setting of ALF. If needed, shorter-acting benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam or lorazepam, rather than longer-acting benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide (Option A) and diazepam, should be used.INR does not accurately predict bleeding risk in patients with ALF; patients with liver disease may also have high levels of circulating procoagulants. Clinically significant bleeding in ALF is uncommon. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment. Patients experiencing bleeding or those for whom a high-risk invasive procedure is planned may require blood product replacement with cryoprecipitate to increase fibrinogen levels to greater than 100 mg/dL (1 g/L) and platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count greater than 50,000/µL (50 × 109/L). Because the patient is not bleeding, cryoprecipitate (Option B) is unnecessary.Glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone (Option C), have not been found to improve mortality in ALF of indeterminant cause, and they increase the risk for infection.",
