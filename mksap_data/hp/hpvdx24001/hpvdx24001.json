The patient's ocular findings show Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are circumferential discolorations that occur in the cornea due to copper deposition in the Descemet membrane. The finding is most easily visible at the inferior and superior poles and usually is seen only on slit-lamp examination in early stages. Kayser-Fleischer rings are associated with Wilson disease but are not pathognomonic for it.",
