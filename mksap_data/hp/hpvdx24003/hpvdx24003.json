  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is hepatic abscess (Option B), most likely an amebic abscess. CT scan of an amebic liver abscess will show a heterogeneous lesion that is round to oval with irregular margins and possible peripheral contrast enhancement, as seen in this image. Internal septations are also common (but not well visualized in this image). Amebic abscesses of the liver are found in resource-limited regions of the world or in persons who have emigrated from countries in which amebiasis is endemic. Intestinal infection with amoebae can result in invasion of the portal vein and migration to the liver. Typical symptoms of amebic liver abscesses include right-upper-quadrant abdominal pain and fever. Hepatic imaging and serologic testing establish the diagnosis of amebic liver abscess.",
