  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is gallstones (Option D). The focused ultrasonography shows the liver (on the left) and the gallbladder in long axis with multiple stones present. The stones appear hyperechoic (white) with shadowing artifact posteriorly, consistent with cholelithiasis. The lumen of a normal gallbladder should appear anechoic (black). It is important to scan through the gallbladder to ensure the entire lumen is visualized before determining whether stones are absent. An indeterminate study would occur if the gallbladder cannot be completely visualized, usually because of underdistention secondary to lack of fasting.",
