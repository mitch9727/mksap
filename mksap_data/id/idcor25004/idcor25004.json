She reports no allergies, recent antibiotic use, or recent travel. She can manage oral intake. She has no other medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, temperature is 38.1 °C (100.6 °F), blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 98/min. Right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness is present.Laboratory studies:Leukocyte count12,000/μL (12 × 109/L)HCreatinine1.1 mg/dL (97.2 µmol/L)Urinalysis with microscopy>100 leukocytes/hpf; many bacteriaUrine culture is pending.",

  "critique": "Oral ciprofloxacin (Option C) is the most appropriate treatment for this patient who has acute pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis is associated with abrupt onset of fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and flank or abdominal pain. Hypotension and septic shock may occur in severe cases. Lower urinary tract symptoms, such as urinary frequency and dysuria, may precede pyelonephritis. Urine culture with susceptibility testing is required before initiation of empiric therapy. Patients with pyelonephritis who are hemodynamically unstable; unable to tolerate oral medication; pregnant; or who have obstructive disease, complicating comorbidities, pathogen resistance requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy, or lack of reliable follow-up should be hospitalized. Outpatient management can be considered for patients with pyelonephritis who are medically stable and able to take oral medication. Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin for 7 days or levofloxacin for 5 days) are the only oral agents recommended for empiric outpatient treatment (except in pregnancy). Notably, an initial dose of a long-acting parenteral antibiotic (such as ceftriaxone, 1 g, or a once-daily aminoglycoside) should be given before oral fluoroquinolone courses when local resistance rates exceed 10%. This patient is not severely ill and does not have risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance, including recent antibiotic use, hospitalization, or international travel; she can be treated as an outpatient with ciprofloxacin.Ampicillin (Option A) and first-generation cephalosporins, such as cephalexin (Option B), are no longer used for empiric therapy of pyelonephritis because of unacceptably high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Oral β-lactams have lower efficacy with higher relapse rates but may be alternatives to fluoroquinolones if susceptibility results are known and no other options are available.Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Option D) should be avoided as initial empiric therapy of pyelonephritis because of the high level of Escherichia coli resistance in the community. However, if a fluoroquinolone is contraindicated, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used after pathogen susceptibility is proven.",
