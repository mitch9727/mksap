  "question_text": "A 20-year-old man is evaluated for an 8-week history of fatigue, malaise, myalgia, intermittent temperature up to 37.8 °C (100.0 °F), and occasional cough. He had tetralogy of Fallot repair as a young child, followed by pulmonary valve replacement at age 15 years. He has not seen a physician since then. His only medication is daily enteric-coated aspirin.On physical examination, temperature is 37.1 °C (98.8 °F); all other vital signs are normal. Several decaying teeth are noted. Central venous pressure is normal. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination reveals a grade 2/6 early-peaking crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border and a grade 3 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the upper left sternal border.Laboratory studies:Leukocyte count9000/µL (9 × 109/L)Comprehensive metabolic panel and urinalysis are normal.Chest radiograph shows clear lung fields.ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm and right bundle branch block.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step is to draw blood cultures (Option A). Patients with congenital heart disease are at increased risk for endocarditis, especially those with unrepaired disease or repaired disease with residual defects, a prosthetic patch, or prosthetic valve. Patients may present with nonspecific symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and malaise. Patients with right-sided endocarditis in particular may have an indolent course. A high index of suspicion of endocarditis is warranted in any patient with a history of congenital heart disease with symptoms that might represent endocarditis. At least two sets of blood cultures should be obtained when even a modest probability of endocarditis is present; echocardiography should also be performed. This patient with poor dentition and a bioprosthetic heart valve presents with low-grade temperature elevations, fatigue, and malaise. He is at high risk for endocarditis and should have blood cultures drawn immediately.Although many patients with endocarditis have elevated inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, these findings are nonspecific (Option B). Considering the clinical suspicion for endocarditis in this patient with a prosthetic valve, blood cultures are the most important test to complete in this clinical setting.Vancomycin and cefepime are appropriate empiric antimicrobials in patients in whom prosthetic valve endocarditis is suspected (Option C). Initiating antibiotics before obtaining blood cultures, however, can make diagnosis and treatment of endocarditis more difficult. Whenever possible, blood cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. Empiric antibiotics should be started as soon as possible in the setting of hemodynamic instability, severe sepsis, or septic shock.Clinical observation is not an appropriate choice for this patient (Option D). Although several features of his presentation are reassuring, including the normal temperature and lack of leukocytosis, fever and leukocytosis are not always present in endocarditis, especially when involving right-sided structures and a less virulent organism. This patient is at high risk for endocarditis and must have blood cultures drawn.",
