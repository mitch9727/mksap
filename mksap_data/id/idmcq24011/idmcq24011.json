  "question_text": "A 74-year-old woman is hospitalized with a 1-month history of productive cough and weight loss. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications are semaglutide and rosuvastatin.On physical examination, temperature is 38.2 °C (100.8 °F) and respiration rate is 18/min; other vital signs are normal. Oxygen saturation is 93% breathing ambient air. Crackles are heard in the left upper lobe of the lung.Laboratory studies reveal normal liver function tests.Chest radiograph shows an infiltrate in the left upper lobe with a small cavity.Sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear is positive. Nucleic acid amplification test is positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and negative for rifampin resistance. AFB culture is pending.Visual acuity and color discrimination tests are normal.",

  "critique": "The four-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol is a preferred option for active pulmonary tuberculosis treatment initiation when drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not suspected or known; pyridoxine should be added to this regimen in patients at risk for isoniazid-related neuropathy (Option C). Persons at risk for drug-resistant M. tuberculosis include those who do not take antituberculous medication as directed or do not complete recommended therapy; who had previously treated tuberculosis and again developed active tuberculosis infection; who are from areas where drug-resistant tuberculosis is common; who received an inadequate antituberculous treatment regimen; and who were exposed to an individual with drug-resistant tuberculosis while still infectious. Patients at risk for neuropathy include pregnant individuals; breastfeeding infants; persons with HIV, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or chronic kidney disease; and older adults. This patient has diabetes and is an older adult; therefore, pyridoxine should be included in her treatment regimen for as long as she is taking isoniazid. Rifampin decreases the concentration of statins; however, this effect is greatest for atorvastatin and simvastatin and least for rosuvastatin.Isoniazid and rifampin (Option A) are recommended for the continuation phase of treatment that follows the intensive phase of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This regimen is inappropriate for the intensive phase of therapy because of the possibility of resistance and the need to rapidly reduce the number of actively growing bacilli.A regimen of isoniazid and rifampin, even with the addition of pyridoxine (Option B), would still be inappropriate for initial treatment in this patient.Empiric treatment for active pulmonary tuberculosis infection should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made and should not be delayed for results of AFB culture and sensitivity results (Option D). Mycobacterial cultures require 3 to 8 weeks to grow depending on the growth medium used by the laboratory; additional time is required to determine susceptibility to antituberculous agents when growth is evident. Testing should be done against rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol as first-line antituberculous agents. The empiric treatment regimen can be tailored when sensitivity results become available.",
