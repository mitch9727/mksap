She reports no symptoms, and her medical history is unremarkable. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.Urinalysis shows a leukocyte count of 10/hpf and erythrocyte count of 1/hpf. Urine culture reveals Escherichia coli greater than 100,000 colony-forming units/mL.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this pregnant patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin (Option B). ASB should not be treated in most patients because it neither decreases the frequency of symptomatic infections nor improves other outcomes; inappropriate treatment is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in health care facilities. However, treatment is indicated in patients undergoing an invasive procedure involving the urinary tract and in pregnant persons, such as this patient. ASB during pregnancy increases the risk for pyelonephritis and has been associated with preterm birth and low-birth-weight neonates; therefore, pregnancy is one of the few indications for screening and treating bacteriuria in asymptomatic patients. A urine culture is recommended at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit. Antibiotic therapy should be culture guided, using an antibiotic with a known safety profile in pregnancy. During pregnancy, preferred antibiotics are amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin, cefpodoxime), nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Nitrofurantoin can be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy but should be avoided in the first trimester because of a possible association with congenital anomalies. Although this patient has ASB, she is pregnant and should be treated to prevent adverse outcomes; nitrofurantoin is an appropriate treatment choice because she is in her second trimester.Fluoroquinolones are considered second-line agents for the treatment of cystitis but are generally avoided in pregnancy because of the potential risk of fetal arthropathy. Ciprofloxacin (Option A) would not be the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient.Although ceftriaxone (Option C) is an acceptable antibiotic therapy to use during pregnancy, intramuscular therapy is not needed because oral options are available. Additionally, one dose of medication is unlikely to be sufficient for treatment of ASB.Pregnancy is an indication for treatment of ASB to decrease the risk of symptomatic cystitis, pyelonephritis, and preterm birth. Therefore, providing no treatment (Option D) for this pregnant patient would not be appropriate management.",
