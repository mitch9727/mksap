  "question_text": "A 68-year-old man undergoes follow-up evaluation for urinalysis results obtained as part of mandatory life insurance evaluation. He reports no urinary symptoms of frequency, urgency, or dysuria. Medical history is notable for kidney transplantation 1 year ago and hypertension. Medications are tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and nifedipine.Vital signs are normal, and physical examination findings are unremarkable except for pain and decreased range of motion in his right hip.The previous urinalysis revealed positive leukocyte esterase and a leukocyte count of 10/hpf. A reflex urine culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to all antibiotics tested.",

  "critique": "No further management is needed for this patient (Option D). Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is defined as the presence of at least 105 colony-forming units/mL of a uropathogen from two consecutive voided urine specimens in women or one specimen in men. ASB is common in many populations, including in those with urologic abnormalities such as this patient who underwent a kidney transplantation 1 year ago. ASB treatment neither decreases the frequency of symptomatic infections nor improves other outcomes. Inappropriate treatment is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance, but indications for treatment of ASB include pregnancy and planned urologic surgery in which trauma to the mucosal barrier is expected. Some experts also treat kidney transplant recipients in the first few months following transplantation. This patient does not meet these criteria. In addition, accompanying pyuria in a patient with ASB is not an indication for treatment.Cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and fosfomycin (Options A-C) would all likely be effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, they are all inappropriate treatment options because antibiotic therapy, whether given intravenously or orally, is not indicated in this patient with ASB.",
