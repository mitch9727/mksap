Medical history is noncontributory, and she takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Clustered vesicles with red flare are present on the left half of the nasal tip and nasal bridge, with associated hyperemic conjunctivitis.",

  "critique": "This patient is at risk for vision loss (Option D) subsequent to development of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Herpes zoster (shingles) commonly presents with symptoms of burning, tingling, or itching followed by eruption of clustered, monomorphic vesicles in a dermatomal distribution. The vesicles have a characteristically unilateral appearance and do not cross the midline. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve dermatome, which includes the forehead, upper eyelid, and nasal tip, requires prompt ophthalmologic referral for evaluation of ocular involvement. Untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus can progress to blindness in the affected eye.Herpes zoster infection with involvement of the external ear canal places the patient at risk for development of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. These patients may exhibit facial paralysis, vestibular symptoms, or dysphonia (Option A, Option C). Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not typically associated with nasal tip involvement.Postherpetic neuralgia (Option B) is a complication of herpes zoster presenting as neuropathic pain of greater than 3 months' duration following the resolution of shingles. Risk factors for this condition include severe symptoms at presentation, older age for adults, and possibly immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy. This patient is relatively young, with rather minor symptoms at onset. She does not have features placing her at elevated risk for postherpetic neuralgia.",
