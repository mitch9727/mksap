  "question_text": "A 19-year-old man is evaluated for a painful, progressively enlarging boil of 2 days' duration. The boil developed on his right forearm after a turf abrasion. He is a college football player. Medical history is notable for hypersensitivity allergy to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. A tender, erythematous 4- × 2-cm furuncle is present on the lateral right forearm with 2 cm of surrounding warmth and erythema.",

  "critique": "This patient has a furuncle, and doxycycline (Option D) should be administered in addition to incision and drainage pending culture and susceptibility results. According to the 2014 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, mild purulent infections, such as furuncles without systemic symptoms, do not require antibiotic therapy after drainage. However, based on more recent studies that show improved cure rates, some experts recommend careful consideration of adjunctive antibiotics for mild uncomplicated abscesses rather than incision and drainage alone (particularly if the diameter is ≥2 cm, significant surrounding cellulitis is present, and risk of transmission to others is enhanced, as in contact sports), considering the possible adverse effects secondary to antibiotic use. Because of the increased likelihood that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the causative agent of purulent skin infections such as furunculosis, empiric treatment should include an agent that is active against MRSA, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole would not be recommended for this patient because of his known allergy. Clindamycin can be used as an alternative but is not used empirically by some experts because of possible of MRSA to resistance clindamycin as well as its increased association with Clostridioides difficile infections.Amoxicillin-clavulanate, oral cephalexin, and dicloxacillin (Options A, B, C) have activity against β-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). However, they are not active against MRSA, which should be targeted empirically in the setting of furunculosis until culture and susceptibility results of drainage material are available. These agents could be used if culture indicates infection is caused by MSSA. Additionally, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the oral agent of choice for empiric outpatient treatment of infected dog, cat, and human bite wounds.Rifampin is active against some strains of MRSA, but monotherapy with this agent is never recommended because of the rapid development of resistance (Option E).",
