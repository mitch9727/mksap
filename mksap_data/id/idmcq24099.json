He consumed hummus several times over the last week made by a manufacturer that has recalled the product because of nontyphoidal Salmonella contamination. Medical history is unremarkable.On physical examination, temperature is 37.3 °C (99.1 °F), blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg, pulse rate is 88/min, and respiration rate is 18/min. Abdominal examination reveals increased bowel sounds and mild tenderness to palpation. No abdominal distension, guarding, or rebound is noted.A complete blood count and metabolic panel are normal.Rapid multiplex molecular assay of stool is positive for Salmonella.",

  "critique": "Most uncomplicated nontyphoidal Salmonella diarrheal infections in adults younger than 50 years are self-limited and require only supportive care (Option D). Nontyphoidal Salmonella strains are a common cause of foodborne illness in the United States, usually resulting from ingestion of fecally contaminated water or food of animal origin (including poultry, beef, eggs, and milk) but may be found in other foods as well. Zoonotic infections associated with reptile, amphibian, or poultry exposure are a less common mode of transmission. The incubation period is usually less than 3 days. The clinical presentation typically includes crampy abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea that is not usually visibly bloody, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Antibiotic treatment of otherwise healthy patients with mild symptoms does not hasten recovery and may lead to prolonged asymptomatic shedding of bacteria. Antibiotics are typically reserved for patients with more serious illness (including severe diarrhea requiring hospitalization, bacteremia, high fever, or sepsis) and those at high risk for severe complicated invasive disease (including infants; immunocompromised patients; persons ≥50 years with significant joint disease or valvular, endovascular, or cardiac abnormalities; and persons ≥65 years of age) to decrease symptom duration and risk for extraintestinal spread.An intravenous fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone (Option A) is often initiated for patients with Salmonella infection who develop bacteremia. Local antibiotic susceptibilities should dictate empiric therapy because geographic differences may exist in resistance profiles.When antibiotics are administered for nontyphoidal Salmonella–associated diarrheal infections, a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin (Option B) is often chosen. However, this otherwise healthy patient with mild Salmonella infection should not be treated with antibiotics.Metronidazole (Option C) has activity against some gastrointestinal protozoan parasites, such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia duodenalis, Balantidium coli, and Blastocystis hominis, as well as bacteria such as Clostridioides difficile and Helicobacter pylori. However, metronidazole does not have activity against Salmonella species.Azithromycin, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Option E) are potentially active against nontyphoidal Salmonella–associated diarrheal infections, but they are not indicated for this otherwise healthy patient.",
