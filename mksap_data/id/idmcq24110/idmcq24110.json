  "question_text": "A 52-year-old man is evaluated for several weeks of pain and a nonhealing wound in his left heel, with spontaneous drainage developing over the past few days. The patient stepped on a clean nail when walking barefoot in his home more than 1 month ago. He cleaned the wound thoroughly after the initial injury and received a short course of oral cephalexin for possible cellulitis; a tetanus booster was given. The lesion initially started to heal before reopening. His medical history is otherwise noncontributory.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The left heel is dressed with gauze, and serosanguineous drainage is noted. Beneath the dressing, the wound is the diameter of a pencil and tracks into the soft tissue. Its base is not visible. The surrounding tissue is not erythematous or hot. Both feet are warm with palpable pulses and intact sensation.",

  "critique": "The patient most likely has osteomyelitis (Option B). In osteomyelitis resulting from direct contamination of a wound, the wound may fail to heal or may reopen after healing. Spontaneously opening wounds accompanied by drainage (sinus tracts) are a manifestation of chronic infection. Fever and other systemic manifestations of infection are uncommon but are more likely in patients with acute hematogenous infection. Considering this patient's penetrating injury, subacute presentation of symptoms progressing over several weeks, and spontaneous drainage from the sinus tract, osteomyelitis is a likely diagnosis.Arterial insufficiency (Option A) typically presents with lesions that are dry and well-demarcated, with a “punched-out” appearance and an overlying eschar. Patients with peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or smoking history are at increased risk; none of these risk factors are present in this patient.A pressure ulcer (Option C) is characterized by a lesion that develops in the setting of sustained pressure over bony prominences, including the heel. Pressure ulcers generally occur in nonambulatory patients, particularly in those who are chronically debilitated or with reduced sensation. This patient's presentation is inconsistent with the diagnosis of pressure ulcer.Pyoderma gangrenosum (Option D) lesions typically begin as a small pustule or red nodule that rapidly expands into a painful, exudative ulcer with an edematous, infiltrated, actively inflamed border. The border is characteristically violaceous with an edge that overhangs the ulcer. Pyoderma gangrenosum, which is relatively uncommon, can arise at the site of recent trauma but is generally associated with a systemic disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, or inflammatory arthritis. This patient's wound is not consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.",
