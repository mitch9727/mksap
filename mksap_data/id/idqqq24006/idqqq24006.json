  "question_text": "A 67-year-old woman is evaluated in December for a 2-day history of fever, headache, myalgia, cough, and sore throat. Medical history is notable for COPD. Medications are fluticasone-vilanterol and albuterol. She received a standard-dose influenza immunization in October. She is tolerating oral intake.On physical examination, temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), blood pressure is 145/62 mm Hg, pulse rate is 98/min, and respiration rate is 20/min. The pharynx is erythematous. Lungs are clear to auscultation.A chest radiograph shows no infiltrates, and a nasopharyngeal swab is positive for influenza B.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate oral treatment for influenza A and B is oseltamivir (Option B). The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend initiating antiviral treatment as soon as possible for hospitalized adults with documented or suspected influenza and for outpatients with severe or progressive illness regardless of illness duration. Treatment is indicated as soon as possible for all other patients at high risk for influenza-related complications such as superimposed pneumococcal or Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia or death. Patients at greatest risk for complications include older adults (≥65 years of age), pregnant and postpartum persons, patients with chronic medical conditions (especially chronic lung or heart disease, immunocompromise, neuromuscular disease, or obesity with a BMI >40), and long-term care residents. Treatment of otherwise healthy outpatients can be considered if started within 48 hours of symptom onset. Antiviral therapy in patients with documented influenza decreases recovery time, hospitalization rates, and complications. Neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) have activity against influenza A and B. Baloxavir is a polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitor that can be given as single-dose therapy for uncomplicated influenza A and B. It must be started within 48 hours of symptom onset and appears to be as effective as a 5-day course of oseltamivir. Baloxavir is FDA approved for the treatment of patients at high risk of influenza complications, but it should not be used in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients and is a more expensive option for treatment of outpatients. Baloxavir use has been associated with the emergence of resistance.M2 inhibitors, such as amantadine (Option A) and rimantadine, were the first agents introduced for influenza treatment, but they are only active against influenza A. These agents are no longer recommended for influenza A treatment because of high levels of resistance among circulating strains.Intravenous peramivir (Option C) is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or are otherwise incapable of taking inhaled or oral agents and is not indicated in this patient tolerating oral intake.Zanamivir (Option D) is an inhaled option for influenza treatment of outpatients. However, it is contraindicated in patients with chronic lung disease, such as asthma or COPD, owing to the risk of bronchospasm, so it is not an appropriate choice for this patient.",
