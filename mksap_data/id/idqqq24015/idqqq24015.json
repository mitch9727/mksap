  "critique": "The proper management of the patient's perioperative urinary catheter is to remove it and observe the patient for spontaneous voiding (Option D). Catheters should be used for appropriate indications only (see ). An indwelling urinary catheter is sometimes inserted in the emergency department during trauma evaluation; however, the need for continuing the catheter should be assessed when the initial evaluation has been completed. Early removal of urinary catheters should be considered, when possible, and can be encouraged by computerized reminder systems and nurse-initiated removal protocols. Patients should be monitored closely for their ability to void spontaneously when a catheter is removed.Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention strategies are summarized by the acronym ABCDE:Adherence to general infection control principlesBladder ultrasonography to potentially avoid catheterizationCondom catheter use or intermittent catheterization when appropriateDo not use an indwelling catheter if criteria for use are not metEarly catheter removal when it is no longer indicatedMost studies have not shown definitive benefit of antimicrobial- or antiseptic-coated catheters (Option A) for short- (<14 days) or long-term catheterization; these catheters are more expensive and, in some cases (e.g., nitrofurazone-coated catheters), cause more patient discomfort.Administering antibiotics with the goal of preventing CAUTI (Option B) is not effective and promotes antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungal CAUTIs. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for this patient.If this patient required prolonged immobilization (e.g., multiple traumatic injuries such as pelvic fractures), continuing the indwelling urinary catheter may be appropriate (Option C). However, this is unlikely to be necessary for a patient with a quickly repaired femur fracture.",
