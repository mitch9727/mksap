  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is cytomegalovirus retinitis (Option C). Approximately 60% to 90% of adults have latent cytomegalovirus infection, with reactivation of disease more common in immunosuppressed persons (such as those with AIDS, transplant recipients, and those receiving glucocorticoids). Cytomegalovirus can cause retinitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, colitis, esophagitis, and adrenalitis in severely immunocompromised persons. Cytomegalovirus retinitis in this patient with advanced HIV infection is characterized by yellow-white, fluffy, or granular retinal lesions, often located close to retinal vessels and associated with hemorrhage. Cytomegalovirus retinitis most often presents unilaterally but can become bilateral without treatment. It is the most common manifestation of tissue-invasive infection in persons living with HIV, particularly in those with CD4 cell counts less than 50/μL.",
