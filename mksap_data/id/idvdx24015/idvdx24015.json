  "critique": "This enlarged image from a frontal chest radiograph shows a fungus ball (in this case, an aspergilloma) (Option A). As shown below, a cavitary lesion (arrowheads) contains a predominantly round mass (arrow). The mass represents a fungus ball (also termed a mycetoma or, when caused by the fungus Aspergillus, an aspergilloma) and consists of fungal hyphae and cellular debris. A fungus ball typically appears to be separated from the wall of the surrounding cavity and may move when the patient is imaged in a different position. Fungus balls form in cavitary lesions of the lung and most often present because of conditions such as tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, carcinoma, or lung abscesses. They may be asymptomatic or present with complications, such as hemoptysis.",
