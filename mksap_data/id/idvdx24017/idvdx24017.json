Purpura fulminans is a severe complication of meningococcal disease. Meningococcal-induced microvascular thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation can lead to widespread hemorrhage into the skin, which can evolve into painful purple geographic lesions. The lesions may become necrotic, with the formation of bullae and vesicles. Meningococcemia is frequently accompanied by associated bacterial meningitis.",
