The chest radiograph shows the bilateral presence of innumerable 1- to 3-mm nodules, predominantly seen within the lower lung fields (black arrows). These findings, although not specific, are typical of dissemination of tuberculosis through the vasculature or the lymphatic vessels. The small nodules have been likened to millet seeds, from which the term miliary is derived. Slight lower lobe predominance is likely a result of the effects of gravity on blood flow.",
