  "critique": "The most likely sputum finding is Candida species (Option C). The image demonstrates pseudohyphae and budding yeast forms, which are characteristic of Candida. Although Candida species can involve the lung as part of a disseminated infection, Candida is a rare cause of primary pneumonia and usually represents colonization when isolated from a sputum sample.Aspergillus fumigatus shows acutely branching hyphae with septations. Blastomyces dermatitidis is seen as large, round, budding yeast with a broad base. Coccidioides immitis is identified by evidence of thick-walled, round structures. Mucor species have broad, irregularly branched hyphae without septations.",
