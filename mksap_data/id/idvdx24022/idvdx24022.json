Although Candida species can involve the lung as part of a disseminated infection, Candida is a rare cause of primary pneumonia and usually represents colonization when isolated from a sputum sample.Aspergillus fumigatus shows acutely branching hyphae with septations. Blastomyces dermatitidis is seen as large, round, budding yeast with a broad base. Coccidioides immitis is identified by evidence of thick-walled, round structures. Mucor species have broad, irregularly branched hyphae without septations.",
