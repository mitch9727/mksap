  "critique": "Cryptococcus neoformans (Option D) is present in this patient's cerebrospinal fluid specimen. The image demonstrates how India ink can outline the clear capsule around a yeast form of C. neoformans. C. neoformans is inhaled and causes an initial pulmonary infection. Healthy persons generally contain the initial infection because of intact cell-mediated immunity; however, immunocompromised persons are at risk for dissemination. Risk factors for dissemination include HIV or AIDS, organ transplantation, glucocorticoid treatment, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, and kidney injury. The central nervous system is the most common site of disseminated cryptococcosis. This patient most likely has cryptococcal meningitis, as evidenced by the triad of headache, fever, and positive India ink preparation of the cerebrospinal fluid; however, the sensitivity of India ink positivity varies in different patient populations. Serum cryptococcal antigen is positive in more than 95% of infected patients and should be obtained in all patients to confirm the diagnosis.",
