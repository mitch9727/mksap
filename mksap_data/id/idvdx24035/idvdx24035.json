  "critique": "The cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain specimen suggests a diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes meningitis (Option B). The image demonstrates many gram-positive, rod-shaped organisms characteristic of L. monocytogenes. Listeria rods are typically short and may occur singly or in short chains. Additionally, Listeria may show gram-variable staining. These characteristics may lead to the mistaken identification on Gram stain as Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, corynebacteria, or, when it stains variably, Haemophilus species. L. monocytogenes is an uncommon cause of meningitis in adults; however, the risk increases in older adults and those with altered cell-mediated immunity.",
