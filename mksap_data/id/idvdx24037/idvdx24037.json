Staphylococcus aureus– and Streptococcus pyogenes–associated exotoxins result in cytokine production that can result in TSS. Staphylococcal TSS is associated with tampon use, nasal packings, surgical wounds, skin ulcers, burns, catheters, and use of injection drugs. Streptococcal TSS is associated with skin and soft-tissue infection, particularly necrotizing fasciitis. Clinical features of TSS may include chills, malaise, fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, and multiorgan involvement.",
