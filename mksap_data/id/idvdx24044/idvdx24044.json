Babesiosis and malaria should be considered in patients with intracellular erythrocyte inclusions, fever, and hemolytic anemia. A history of a tick bite is consistent with the transmission of babesiosis, whereas malaria is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. The characteristic finding of babesiosis is the intraerythrocytic tetrad, or Maltese cross, as shown. In addition, vacuolated, pleomorphic rings without pigment or gametocytes are characteristic of Babesia infection.",
