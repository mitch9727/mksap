Grouped vesicles (small, clear, fluid-filled blisters) on an erythematous, edematous base are characteristic. They often become cloudy pustules before rupturing, leaving behind clustered erosions (shown) that usually completely involute within 3 to 5 days. This patient's type of HSV skin infection is referred to as herpes gladiatorum and is typically associated with contact sports.",
