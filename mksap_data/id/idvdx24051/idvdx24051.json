  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is tuberculosis (Option D). The frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation. A left pleural effusion is also present. Reactivation (postprimary) pulmonary tuberculosis may be associated with thin-walled cavities or cavities found within an area of patchy airspace opacity. Most tuberculous pulmonary cavities do not contain fluid, but up to 20% may demonstrate an air-fluid interface because of bacterial superinfection or bleeding.",
