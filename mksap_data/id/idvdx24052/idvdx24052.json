  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is Clostridioides difficile colitis (Option A), as evidenced by pseudomembranes (severe inflammation of the inner lining of the colon) seen on this patient's colonoscopy. Diagnosis is usually established by testing stool from persons who have unexplained new-onset diarrhea occurring three or more times per day. In general, colonoscopy is not performed in patients with typical disease and positive laboratory evaluation. Colonoscopy may be useful if a suspected alternative diagnosis requires direct visualization and biopsy.",
