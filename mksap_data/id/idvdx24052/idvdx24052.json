Diagnosis is usually established by testing stool from persons who have unexplained new-onset diarrhea occurring three or more times per day. In general, colonoscopy is not performed in patients with typical disease and positive laboratory evaluation. Colonoscopy may be useful if a suspected alternative diagnosis requires direct visualization and biopsy.",
