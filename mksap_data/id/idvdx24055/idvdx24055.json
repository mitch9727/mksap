  "critique": "The sputum specimen Gram stain demonstrates gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci, a finding characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) (Option D). Diagnostic studies to identify a causative organism are not routinely indicated in outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but should be considered in non-ICU hospitalized patients when this information would alter therapy. All patients with CAP who require admission to the ICU should undergo diagnostic evaluation to confirm a microbial cause. Interpretation of sputum Gram stain and culture is hampered by the presence of oropharyngeal colonization, and growth may reflect nonpathogenic organisms. A good-quality sputum culture obtained before antibiotic initiation is suggestive or diagnostic in up to 80% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia; sensitivity decreases after antibiotic therapy.",
