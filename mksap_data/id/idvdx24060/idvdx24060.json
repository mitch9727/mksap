Osler nodes are tender, red-purple nodules located on the pulp of the digits, or occasionally on the hands or feet, which are associated with infective endocarditis (most commonly, subacute forms of endocarditis). Osler nodes are composed of microabscesses and immune complex deposition in the papillary dermis, together with microemboli in the nearby dermal arterioles, compared with Janeway lesions, which are nontender, macular, often hemorrhagic lesions.",
