Oral hairy leukoplakia is typically recognized by its occurrence on the lateral portions of the tongue (although other oral sites may also be involved) as white painless plaques that cannot be scraped off. Oral hairy leukoplakia is a manifestation of Epstein-Barr virus infection of the squamous epithelium of the tongue and is not considered to be premalignant. It is relatively specific for HIV infection but can also occur in other immunodeficiency states.",
