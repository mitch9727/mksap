  "critique": "Mediterranean spotted fever (Option D) is a febrile illness caused by Rickettsia conorii that is transmitted by the bite of the dog tick and is endemic to countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Illness presents with fever, chills, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, and a necrotic ulceration (sometimes referred to as a tache noire) seen at the site of the tick bite. A maculopapular and sometimes petechial rash develops several days after this initial prodrome. Diagnosis can be made by serology or molecular assay on a skin biopsy of the rash or eschar and should be suspected in patients with characteristic cutaneous findings after travel to an endemic region. Treatment with doxycycline is recommended.",
