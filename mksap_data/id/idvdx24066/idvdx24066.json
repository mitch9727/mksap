  "critique": "Kaposi sarcoma (Option B) is a vascular malignancy of the lymphatic endothelium associated with human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infection in patients with severely impaired adaptive immunity. HHV-8 infection is predominantly seen in endemic regions of the globe (such as equatorial Africa) and among men who have sex with men. Progression to Kaposi sarcoma most commonly occurs in patients with advanced HIV infection who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Mucocutaneous lesions are typically dark red, violaceous, or brown papules and macules that may ulcerate. Because of their vascular nature, lesions often bleed easily during biopsy for histopathology.",
