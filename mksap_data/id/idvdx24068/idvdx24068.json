It is caused most commonly by β-hemolytic streptococcal species, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, and usually follows a traumatic insult to the skin, which is often minor. Symptoms and signs include poorly demarcated erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings.",
