  "question_text": "A 40-year-old man is evaluated for an 18-month history of anxiety at work. He says that while he is in the office, he constantly worries about \"everything, including the day-to-day little things.\" He realizes his level of worry is unnecessary, but he cannot stop himself from worrying, and it is affecting his day-to-day functioning at work and home. He also has difficulty sleeping, is unable to concentrate on tasks for a long time, and feels drained by the end of the day. He does not feel depressed and reports no anhedonia. He currently takes no medications. He does not drink alcohol or use nonprescribed substances.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.Laboratory studies:Thyroid-stimulating hormone2.5 µU/mL (2.5 mU/L) Thyroxine, free1.0 ng/dL (12.9 pmol/L)",

  "critique": "This patient has generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and in addition to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the most appropriate treatment is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, such as escitalopram (Option D). GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety about activities or events (occupation, school) that a patient finds difficult to control, occurs more days than not for at least 6 months, causes significant distress and functional impairment, and is associated with physical symptoms. CBT and pharmacotherapy are equally effective in the treatment of moderate to severe GAD, but combination therapy may be more effective than either alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), buspirone, and tricyclic antidepressants are all effective in the treatment of GAD (see Table: Pharmacotherapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder). SSRIs and SNRIs are preferred first-line medications because they have fewer adverse effects than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike buspirone, effectively treat comorbid behavioral disorders. For patients with severe GAD leading to profound functional impairment or with severe comorbid mood disorders, a combined approach of pharmacotherapy with referral to psychotherapy is preferred, and further evaluation by a psychiatrist is recommended. This patient's symptoms are consistent with GAD. A combination of CBT and first-line pharmacotherapy, such as the SSRI escitalopram, is the most appropriate treatment.Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Option A), are not the most appropriate next step in treatment because of the potential for adverse effects. They are an appropriate option in GAD only for patients who cannot tolerate first-line medications.Buspirone (Option B) would not be the most appropriate choice because SSRIs and SNRIs are preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for GAD. Buspirone can be used as a second-line or add-on therapy with an SSRI but is effective only for anxiety; it has no effect on comorbid behavioral disorders.Clonazepam (Option C) is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Benzodiazepines can be effective for short-term control of severe symptoms during the initial treatment phase but are not first-line therapy, nor are they appropriate for long-term treatment (>2-4 weeks) because of adverse effects, most notably an increased risk for dementia and the potential for addiction.",
