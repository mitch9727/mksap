  "question_text": "A 68-year-old man with benign prostatic hyperplasia is evaluated for a persistently slow urinary stream, straining to urinate, and incomplete emptying. He has instituted several behavioral changes, including stopping drinking caffeine after noon and stopping drinking fluids 4 hours before bedtime. His International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was in the severe range at 23 last year, and his tamsulosin dose was increased from 0.4 mg to 0.8 mg daily. The IPSS has improved but remains in the severe range at 21. He is unhappy with his quality of life. He has no other medical problems and takes no other medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The prostate is not enlarged on digital rectal examination.Laboratory studies:Prostate-specific antigen1.0 ng/mL (1.0 µg/L)",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient is urology referral for consideration of surgical treatment (Option C). For patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and bothersome moderate to severe symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] >8), pharmacotherapy with α1-blockers, such as tamsulosin, is appropriate. When symptoms remain troublesome despite α1-blocker therapy, a trial of combination therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitors (dutasteride and finasteride) is appropriate in patients with an enlarged prostate, as demonstrated by a prostate volume greater than 30 mL on imaging, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level greater than 1.5 ng/mL (1.5 µg/L), or enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination (DRE). The addition of a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor may also be considered. Otherwise, surgical therapy is indicated in patients with persistent symptoms affecting quality of life. Surgical treatment most commonly includes transurethral resection of the prostate; other options include vaporization of the prostate, prostatic urethral lift, laser enucleation, and water vapor thermal therapy. BPH complications, such as urinary retention or persistent gross hematuria, may also indicate the need for surgery. This patient has severe BPH symptoms without clinical evidence of a significantly enlarged prostate, and symptoms have not adequately responded to α1-blockers. Surgical treatment is indicated.Finasteride (Option A) would not be the most appropriate treatment. Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and decreases the size of the prostate. Symptom relief usually requires at least 6 months of therapy. It is effective in patients with an enlarged prostate by DRE, imaging, or PSA level (>1.5 ng/mL [1.5 µg/L]). This patient does not have an enlarged prostate based on his DRE, and finasteride is not indicated.Oxybutynin (Option B) is not the most appropriate treatment. In patients with primarily irritative symptoms (frequency, urgency, nocturia), overactive bladder may also be contributing to symptoms, and antimuscarinic agents like oxybutynin can be considered. This patient has primarily obstructive symptoms rather than irritative symptoms, and oxybutynin is not likely to be effective.Offering no additional treatment (Option D) is not appropriate for this patient. He has a high IPSS and is unhappy with the effect of his symptoms on his quality of life. Given the failure of medical therapy and the presence of many effective surgical options, he should be referred for surgery.",
