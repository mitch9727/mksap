  "critique": "This patient with a breast mass on clinical breast examination (CBE) but negative mammogram should be referred to a breast surgeon for possible biopsy or excision (Option B). Imaging of a breast mass may include diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasonography. In the evaluation of a breast mass, mammography is the first test performed in most women aged 30 years or older and men aged 25 years or older. The mammogram may demonstrate a mass, asymmetric density, or abnormal or pleomorphic calcifications potentially indicating breast cancer; the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) is used for reporting all breast imaging findings (see Table: BI-RADS Assessment Categories). Regardless of the BI-RADS category, however, any suspicious finding on CBE should be evaluated by biopsy or excision, even if no mass is identified on imaging. This patient has a palpable mass on examination and should be referred for consideration of biopsy or excision despite the negative mammogram.Breast MRI (Option A) is not recommended for the initial evaluation of a breast mass. Breast MRI does have utility in breast cancer screening, such as for women at very high risk for breast cancer (see Table: MRI Breast Cancer Screening Recommendations) and in select patients with established breast cancer. However, in the evaluation of a breast mass, mammography is the recommended first-line imaging modality in women older than age 30 years, whereas breast ultrasonography is recommended for women younger than age 30 years and those who are pregnant.Repeating the clinical breast examination in 6 weeks (Option C) would be of limited utility. Although findings may suggest a benign rather than malignant lesion, the predictive value of clinical breast examination is poor. All women presenting with a palpable mass should be further evaluated by imaging followed by biopsy, if indicated.Because of the discordance between this patient's physical examination and imaging findings, it would be inappropriate to recommend no further evaluation (Option D). Although mammography has high predictive value, false-negative results are possible and any concerning clinical examination findings should be further evaluated through biopsy or excision.",

  "question_text": "A 42-year-old woman is evaluated because of a quarter-size right breast mass that she first noticed 2 months ago. She does not have any other symptoms, including breast pain or skin changes. She has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. A palpable 1.5-cm, round, firm mass is noted in the right breast at the 2 o’clock position. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination is normal.Mammogram reveals a BI-RADS category of 1: negative for any abnormality. Breast ultrasonography shows no abnormalities.",
