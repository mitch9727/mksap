  "question_text": "A 28-year-old woman comes to the clinic to establish care. She has no acute concerns or chronic health conditions. She has two children, and her last pregnancy 2 years ago was complicated by gestational diabetes. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test 2 months after delivery was normal. She is sexually active and monogamous with her husband and uses a levonorgestrel intrauterine device, which was placed 1 year ago, for contraception. Her last cervical cancer screening, 2 years ago, was normal. She is up to date with vaccinations.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "Given this patient's history of gestational diabetes, is it most appropriate to screen for diabetes (Option D). Patients with a history of gestational diabetes are at increased risk for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease and should be screened more aggressively than an average-risk patient. This should be done initially with a fasting blood glucose level or a 2-hour, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between 4 and 12 weeks postpartum and then every 1 to 3 years with a hemoglobin A1c level or fasting plasma glucose level annually or with a 2-hour, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test every 3 years. Patients should additionally be counseled on risk mitigation, including the importance of a healthy lifestyle and obtaining a normal weight. Beyond gestational diabetes, patients should also be assessed for a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension. Similar to gestational diabetes, these conditions increase the risk for future cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, unlike gestational diabetes, there are no clear guidelines on screening or preventive measures for women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy other than lifestyle modification and close monitoring for the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This patient has a history of gestational diabetes and should be screened for the development of diabetes every 1 to 3 years.This patient is only 28 years of age and has no family history of breast cancer; therefore, breast cancer screening (Option A) is not recommended. Although there is debate among professional societies about exactly when to begin breast cancer screening, none recommend beginning screening before age 40 years in average-risk women.Because this patient had normal results on cervical cancer screening 2 years ago, she is not due for repeat cervical cancer screening (Option B). Patients should undergo cervical cancer screening every 3 years if screening is done with cytology alone or every 5 years if human papillomavirus–based testing is used.Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea (Option C) is not the most appropriate next step for this patient. Routine screening for these infections is recommended for women younger than age 25 years or those older than 25 years who are at increased risk. This patient is 28 years old and reports only one monogamous sexual partner. Therefore, screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea is not recommended.",
