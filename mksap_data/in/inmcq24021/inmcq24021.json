He has tried to quit several times and is looking for the most efficacious approach. He has hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Medications are lisinopril, atorvastatin, and aspirin.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "Varenicline (Option E) would be the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment for this patient to support smoking cessation. Varenicline is a partial nicotinic receptor agonist that has been shown to be more effective as tobacco cessation monotherapy than bupropion or nicotine replacement monotherapy. The combination of varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be the most effective strategy, and treatment with varenicline can be initiated even before a person stops smoking. Pharmacologic therapy should be provided along with behavioral interventions because combining behavioral counseling with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either modality alone. Effective counseling and behavioral resources include problem-solving guidance (such as developing a quit plan and overcoming barriers), motivational interviewing, social support, and telephone quit lines. This patient wishes to stop smoking and should be treated with varenicline in combination with behavioral therapy and nicotine replacement.Bupropion (Option A), a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor with nicotinic receptor activity, is less effective for smoking cessation than varenicline or combination NRT with long- and short-acting nicotine forms and would not be the first choice for this patient. However, it is a reasonable choice for individuals who have had short-term success with it in a previous quit attempt, have concomitant depression, or wish to minimize postcessation weight gain.The 24-hour nicotine patch (Option B) is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Although NRT is a recommended option in helping patients quit smoking, it is most effective as a combination of a long-acting form (nicotine patch) and a short-acting form (nicotine gum or lozenge). The patch provides sustained withdrawal symptom relief for 24 hours, whereas the short-acting nicotine product is added as needed to control breakthrough cravings or other withdrawal symptoms. The long-acting patch alone would not be the most appropriate therapy for this patient, who should receive varenicline combined with nicotine replacement as first-line therapy.Nortriptyline (Option C), a tricyclic antidepressant, is not indicated for this patient. Nortriptyline has shown moderate efficacy in aiding smoking cessation in individuals who cannot use a first-line agent or who need an adjunct to first-line therapy. Adverse effects include dry mouth and sedation. This patient has no contraindications to varenicline and should receive first-line therapy.Sertraline (Option D) would not be appropriate for this patient because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not been shown to be effective for smoking cessation.",

    "Nicotine replacement therapy is recommended for smoking cessation; when used as monotherapy, it is most effective as a combination of a long-acting form (nicotine patch) and a short-acting form (nicotine gum or lozenge)."
