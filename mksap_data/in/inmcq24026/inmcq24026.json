  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient who has major depressive disorder (MDD) is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus sertraline (Option B). For diagnosis of MDD, patients must have five or more of the following symptoms (at least one of which must be depressed mood or anhedonia) nearly every day or all of the time during the same 2-week period:Depressed moodAnhedoniaInsomnia/hypersomniaWeight loss/gain, appetite increase/decreaseFatigue/decreased energyPsychomotor agitation/retardationDecreased concentrationFeelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guiltRecurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attemptFor initial acute therapy of MDD, psychotherapy (CBT or interpersonal therapy) or a second-generation antidepressant such as sertraline is indicated, with the choice of treatment based on a discussion of adverse effects, cost, accessibility, and patient preferences. However, combination therapy with psychotherapy and medication is more effective than either treatment modality alone and should be pursued when feasible. This patient has depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, and decreased concentration and meets the criteria for MDD; combination therapy with CBT and pharmacotherapy should be offered.CBT alone (Option A) would not be the most appropriate treatment. Although CBT is an effective first step in the treatment of depression, combination CBT and pharmacotherapy would be more effective.Ketamine (Option C) is not the most appropriate treatment option in this patient. Ketamine and its enantiomer, esketamine, are glutamate receptor modulators useful in patients with MDD with suicidal ideation as well as treatment-resistant depression. They are distinguished by their immediate onset of antidepressant effect. They are not, however, considered first-line pharmacotherapy for MDD.Pharmacotherapy alone with sertraline (Option D) is an effective first step in the treatment of depression, but sertraline combined with CBT is more effective.",

    "In patients with major depressive disorder in whom combination therapy with psychotherapy and second-generation antidepressant therapy is not possible, the choice between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is based on a discussion of adverse effects, cost, accessibility, and patient preferences."
