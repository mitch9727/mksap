  "question_text": "A 25-year-old patient is evaluated for a 2-day history of itchiness of the eyes with increased redness and drainage. They additionally have upper airway congestion, sneezing, and clear rhinorrhea, all of which began 4 days ago. They have no visual changes and do not wear contact lenses or use eyedrops. They work in a day care center. They have no history of allergic rhinitis or other medical problems and take no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Examination of the eyes shows conjunctival injection and irritation with clear discharge and crusts on the upper and lower eyelashes bilaterally. Swelling is noted in the nasal passages. The oropharynx is clear. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "critique": "This patient has nonspecific viral conjunctivitis associated with an upper respiratory tract infection, and the most appropriate treatment is cold compresses to the eyes (Option B). Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye and may be due to infectious and noninfectious causes (Table: Cardinal Features of Eye Conditions That Cause Red Eye). Viral conjunctivitis is commonly spread through direct contact and often occurs concomitantly with a viral respiratory tract infection. Symptoms include erythema due to enlarged veins, clear discharge, and discomfort. A foreign body sensation in the eyes and pruritus also may occur. Symptoms may begin in one eye and then spread to the contralateral eye. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial infection, allergic conjunctivitis, response to an irritant, and autoimmune disease. Bacterial conjunctivitis has similar symptoms, but the ocular discharge is typically purulent. Allergic conjunctivitis also has a presentation similar to that of viral conjunctivitis but tends to be more seasonal and not associated with other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection other than rhinorrhea. Therapy for viral conjunctivitis is supportive and includes cold compresses; antibiotics are not indicated. Saline or antihistamine-containing ophthalmic drops may also be helpful. Symptoms are usually mild and resolve within 1 to 2 weeks. Failure to improve or suspicion of herpes simplex virus infection, which frequently causes eyelid vesicles, should prompt referral to an ophthalmologist. This patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest viral conjunctivitis. They have no findings (e.g., a history of vasculitis, visual changes, or contact lens use) that predispose them to a more serious cause of their symptoms. Symptomatic treatment with cold compresses is the most appropriate management.Ciprofloxacin eyedrops (Option A) would not be the most appropriate management. They have no findings suggestive of a bacterial infection, and antibiotic eyedrops should not be used to treat viral conjunctivitis as prophylaxis against secondary bacterial infection.Eyedrops that contain glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone (Option C), are not indicated for viral conjunctivitis. They may have a limited role in complicated ocular disease but should be prescribed only in consultation with an ophthalmologist.Ophthalmologic consultation (Option D) is not indicated because the patient has no findings to suggest a more complex inflammatory condition. They have no visual disturbances, do not wear contact lenses, and have no significant medical history of autoimmune or vascular disease.",
