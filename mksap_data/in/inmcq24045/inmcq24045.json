  "question_text": "A 65-year-old woman is evaluated because of increasing difficulty driving at night. She describes halos around oncoming headlights and difficulty discerning street signs and other vehicles. She has no difficulty driving during daylight hours. She has worn reading glasses for a decade and has noted no significant change in her ability to read small print. She has no headaches, eye pain, floaters, or flashing lights. She is physically active and plays golf regularly without limitation. She has no other medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Visual fields and acuity are normal bilaterally. The red reflex is absent, and it is difficult to visualize the retina. The remainder of the examination is normal.",

  "critique": "The most likely cause of this patient's visual changes is cataracts (Option B). Cataracts result from lens opacification and are a leading cause of blindness. The frequency of cataracts increases with age, but ultraviolet light exposure, alcohol use, and smoking are also risk factors. They frequently cause glare sensitivity, halos around lights, and vision impairment, particularly at night and when reading road signs. Examination reveals lens opacification along with a diminished or absent red reflex. Asymptomatic cataracts require no treatment. Patients with vision-impairing cataracts should be referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration of phacoemulsification with intraoperative lens replacement. This patient is experiencing visual changes that interfere with her ability to drive a vehicle at night. Her age, the description of seeing halos around bright objects, and the absent red reflex are consistent with cataracts. Referral for ophthalmologic evaluation and consideration of surgery are appropriate measures.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Option A) most frequently presents as painless central vision loss that may manifest as a central scotoma or difficulty with reading or facial recognition. It typically progresses to blindness over years to decades, although the more aggressive wet form can do so in weeks to months. AMD is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient with vision changes limited to the night.Primary open-angle glaucoma (Option C) is the second-leading cause of blindness in the United States. It is characterized by atrophy of the optic nerve with associated increase in intraocular pressure. Patients have a gradual loss of vision, initially in the peripheral fields, but vision loss may not be noticed until the central fields are affected. Although glaucoma could cause visual disturbances like those the patient is experiencing, they would most likely not be limited to only nighttime; cataracts are a more likely explanation.Retinal detachment (Option D) is secondary to the separation of the retinal neurosensory layer from underlying structures. It usually presents acutely with visual symptoms of unilateral flashing lights and floaters. It commonly occurs in patients with myopia, a positive family history, past cataract surgery, and other retinal disorders. It is an ocular emergency requiring immediate referral to an ophthalmologist (see Figure: Retinal Detachment). This patient with chronic symptoms is unlikely to have retinal detachment.",
