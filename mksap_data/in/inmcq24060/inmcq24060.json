  "critique": "The most appropriate next immediate diagnostic test to perform is to differentiate sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss using Weber and Rinne tests (Option D). Sudden hearing loss and potential sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) occurring with an onset of less than 72 hours should be evaluated urgently. Patients often present with ear fullness, tinnitus, and/or vertigo. Examination should include inspection of the ear canal and tympanic membrane (TM) to identify causes of conductive hearing loss (such as cerumen, effusion, foreign body, otitis, and TM perforation) and cranial nerve testing. In addition, tuning fork testing to determine whether hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural in origin is an important step in the evaluation of sudden hearing loss. Correct performance of Weber and Rinne tests is crucial for best test performance (see Table: Distinguishing Between Conductive and Sensorineural Hearing Loss). When the diagnosis of SSNHL is confirmed, the patient should undergo audiometry (within 14 days of symptom onset) and MRI with internal auditory canal protocol with contrast to evaluate for acoustic neuromas. This patient experienced sudden-onset hearing loss and tinnitus 1 day ago, and the most appropriate next step is to evaluate them for SSNHL using Weber and Rinne testing.Audiometry (Option A) is not the most appropriate next step. Audiometric confirmation of SSNHL should be done within 14 days of symptom onset, although some experts recommend that it be completed within 72 hours. However, tuning fork testing should be done first in this patient to differentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing loss.CT of the head (Option B) is not the most appropriate next step in management. The American Academy of Otolaryngology guidelines recommend against performing head CT in the evaluation of SSNHL. High-resolution CT of the temporal bones along with auditory brainstem response testing is an acceptable alternative in patients who cannot undergo MRI, but this is not the case with this patient.MRI of the brain, brainstem, and internal auditory canals (Option C) is not the most appropriate next step. Patients with SSNHL should undergo MRI of the retrocochlear structures, but physical examination to confirm the diagnosis of SSNHL should be completed first.",

  "question_text": "A 55-year-old patient is evaluated in the emergency department 1 day after the sudden onset of hearing loss in the right ear. They also have constant right-sided tinnitus but no vertigo, diplopia, headache, or other neurologic symptoms. They have no medical conditions and take no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The external ear canals are clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are normal with no perforation. Hearing to finger rub and whisper testing is diminished on the right side. Neurologic examination, including cranial nerve testing, is otherwise normal.",
