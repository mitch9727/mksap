  "question_text": "A 31-year-old man is evaluated during a follow-up visit for depression. He previously experienced two episodes of major depressive disorder that were effectively treated with fluoxetine. Three months ago, he presented with recurrent depression symptoms. His PHQ-9 score was 14, indicating moderate depression. Fluoxetine was initiated and titrated to an effective dosage. The patient now reports significant improvement in his symptoms. His PHQ-9 score is 6, indicating mild depression; he reports no adverse effects from the medication. He has had no manic symptoms.",

  "critique": "Long-term continuation of fluoxetine at the current dosage, which has been effective for symptom management, is appropriate for this patient with recurrent episodes of depression (Option C). Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association recommend long-term maintenance therapy for patients with three or more episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD), persistent depressive disorder, or residual depressive symptoms despite appropriate treatment. The same antidepressant and dosage that were effective in the treatment of acute depression should be continued for long-term maintenance therapy. Therefore, this patient should continue his current treatment with fluoxetine at the same dosage.Ketamine infusion (Option A) has been shown to improve depressive symptoms and may help reduce suicidal ideation in patients with severe MDD for whom at least two previous adequate trials of antidepressant medications at therapeutic doses have failed. This patient has had significant improvement in his symptoms while taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy, so this form of treatment is not indicated.Switching to another antidepressant medication, such as bupropion (Option B), for long-term maintenance is not indicated unless the patient develops intolerable adverse effects from the initial medication. This patient is not experiencing any adverse effects of fluoxetine and has experienced significant symptom improvement. Therefore, switching to a different agent is not indicated.Discontinuing fluoxetine (Option D) is not the most appropriate management. This patient has had three episodes of depression, so SSRI therapy should be maintained to prevent recurrence. Additionally, discontinuing fluoxetine abruptly is not recommended because of the risk for medication discontinuation syndrome, even if the patient is not a candidate for long-term therapy. The most common discontinuation symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, headache, and nausea. Although fluoxetine has the lowest incidence of discontinuation syndrome, therapy should be tapered rather than abruptly stopped.",

    "The American Psychiatric Association recommends long-term maintenance therapy for patients with three or more episodes of major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or residual depressive symptoms despite adequate therapy; the antidepressant dosage that was effective in acute treatment should be continued for long-term maintenance if symptoms are well controlled on the medication."
