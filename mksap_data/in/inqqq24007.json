  "question_text": "A 35-year-old woman is evaluated during a routine follow-up examination for hypothyroidism and requests a prescription for an oral contraceptive pill. She is in a new sexual relationship. She has regular menstrual cycles occurring every 4 weeks and is expecting her next menses in several days. Cervical cytology obtained 2 years ago for cervical cancer screening was normal. She has hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 67 years.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. BMI is 25. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.",

  "critique": "Pregnancy testing (Option D) is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Strategies to reduce unintended pregnancy require assessing pregnancy risk, counseling patients regarding contraceptive options, and ensuring correct and consistent use of contraceptives. Most women can start most contraceptive methods at any time. Available contraceptive methods include hormonal contraception, barrier contraceptives, and sterilization. Few examinations or tests are needed before starting a contraceptive method other than a thorough history and blood pressure and BMI measurements. A pregnancy test should be obtained if more than 7 days have elapsed since the start of the last menses. This patient's last menstrual period was 4 weeks ago, and she should therefore receive pregnancy testing before starting a contraceptive.Although this patient has a family history of breast cancer, advising against hormonal contraception (Option A) is not the most appropriate management. Hormonal contraceptives include daily oral pills, transdermal patches, the vaginal ring, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, the subdermal implant, and intrauterine devices. Contraindications to combination products include a personal history of breast cancer, advanced liver disease, migraine with aura, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Estrogen-containing preparations are contraindicated in women older than age 35 years who smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day. A family history of breast cancer is not a contraindication for hormonal contraception.In healthy women of reproductive age, mammography (Option B) is not needed before beginning hormonal contraception. In 2024, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that all women undergo screening mammography every other year from age 40 to 74 years. This patient currently has no indications for mammography.Performing a pelvic examination and cervical cancer screening (Option C) is not the most appropriate next step. According to the USPSTF, cervical cancer screening in women aged 21 to 65 years may be accomplished with cytology every 3 years or with high-risk human papillomavirus testing either alone or combined with cytology every 5 years. The 2020 American Cancer Society guidelines also list cervical cytology testing every 3 years as an acceptable screening strategy for women aged 25 to 65 years but recommend human papillomavirus testing either alone or combined with cervical cytology every 5 years as acceptable alternatives. This patient's cervical cancer screening result was normal 2 years ago, and she does not need repeat screening at this time.",
