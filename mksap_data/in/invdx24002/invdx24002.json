Lesions may also be purpuric, hyperkeratotic, bullous, or ulcerated. There is typically no vaginal involvement. Common symptoms include itching (which can be debilitating), dysuria, and dyspareunia. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Women with lichen sclerosus are at increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.",
