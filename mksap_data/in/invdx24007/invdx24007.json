  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is viral conjunctivitis (Option D), which typically presents as unilateral, painless, diffuse redness of the eye associated with a watery or mucoserous discharge. On examination, inflamed and dilated (injected) conjunctival blood vessels are seen, with mild crusting at the lateral commissure and inferior eyelid. Inspection of the retracted lower eyelid may also show a follicular (“bumpy”) appearance of the lid (tarsal) conjunctiva. Vision and pupillary reflexes are preserved.",
