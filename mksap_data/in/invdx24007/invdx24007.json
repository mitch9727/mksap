On examination, inflamed and dilated (injected) conjunctival blood vessels are seen, with mild crusting at the lateral commissure and inferior eyelid. Inspection of the retracted lower eyelid may also show a follicular (“bumpy”) appearance of the lid (tarsal) conjunctiva. Vision and pupillary reflexes are preserved.",
