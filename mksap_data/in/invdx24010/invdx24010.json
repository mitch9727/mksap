  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is a cataract (Option A), recognized as opacification of the normally optically clear lens behind the pupil and iris. Cataracts should be suspected in patients presenting with painless gradual worsening of visual acuity. Glare sensitivity and vision impairment may be especially noticeable at night. In addition to lens opacification, direct ophthalmoscopy will show a diminished red reflex, and an obscured funduscopic examination. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide.",
