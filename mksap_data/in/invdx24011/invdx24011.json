  "critique": "This patient most likely has orbital cellulitis (Option B), as characterized by periorbital erythema and swelling. Orbital cellulitis can be distinguished from preseptal cellulitis (periorbital cellulitis) by the presence of pain with eye movements, ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and vision impairment; orbital cellulitis involves the extraocular muscle and fatty tissue, whereas preseptal cellulitis does not. The diagnosis of orbital cellulitis can be confirmed by CT of the orbits and sinuses and should prompt immediate referral to an ophthalmologist.",
