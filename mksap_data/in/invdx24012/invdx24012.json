  "critique": "Trichomoniasis (Option D) is the most likely diagnosis because of the motile trichomonads (arrow) seen on this vaginal wet mount. Trichomonads are slightly larger than leukocytes, are usually oval or pear shaped, and have flagella. Women with trichomoniasis may be asymptomatic or have copious vaginal discharge that is malodorous, pale yellow or gray, frothy, and associated with vulvar itching and burning. Microscopy with examination of a wet mount can establish the diagnosis when positive, but false-negative test results are common. The CDC recommends nucleic acid amplification testing as the primary diagnostic test for trichomoniasis.",
