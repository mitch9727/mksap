  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (Option B), as demonstrated by the copious purulent discharge seen in the image. Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by an abrupt onset and extensive purulent discharge. It is usually associated with gonococcal infection in a sexually active patient. It is vision threatening, and emergent ophthalmology referral is necessary. Keratitis, iritis, and scleritis typically do not cause copious purulent drainage.",
