  "critique": "This patient most likely has streptococcal pharyngitis (Option D). Most cases of pharyngitis are caused by viruses with features consistent with a viral infection, including concomitant cough, conjunctivitis, coryza, hoarseness, and oral ulcers. Less than 15% of pharyngitis cases are caused by bacteria, most often group A Streptococcus pyogenes. The presence of three or more Centor criteria (fever by history, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough) should prompt testing for streptococcal infection using a rapid antigen detection test. Scarlet fever refers to the presence of a diffuse erythematous papular “sandpaper” rash that begins in the axillae and groin, spreads centrally, and then to the extremities (typically not involving the palms and soles). A strawberry tongue may also be present. The combination of pharyngitis and a diffuse erythematous rash makes streptococcal infection a leading diagnostic possibility.",
