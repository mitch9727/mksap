Patients with corneal ulceration usually have pain, a prominent foreign body sensation, and excessive blinking and tearing. Although not seen on this image, pus may be visible in the anterior chamber (hypopyon). Anterior uveitis causes pain, redness, and hypopyon but is not associated with the corneal changes seen in this image. Episcleritis and conjunctival hemorrhage cause a red eye but are not painful.",
