Episcleritis is characterized by a red, flat or nodular, superficial lesion that allows visualization of the underlying vasculature. The lesion is usually not painful. Episcleritis is typically a self-limited condition, is not associated with systemic disease, and does not threaten vision. In contrast, scleritis is often associated with underlying inflammatory diseases, causes severe pain, and can threaten vision.",
