Patients present with intense pain, photophobia, ciliary injection (redness at the junction between the cornea and sclera; “ciliary flush”) (arrow), an irregularly shaped pupil, and miosis. Anterior uveitis may be caused by extension of an infection from another part of the eye or may be associated with an underlying disease, such as the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, sarcoidosis, herpes zoster, tuberculosis, or syphilis. In contrast to uveitis, episcleritis does not cause pain, and scleritis causes scleral edema and a violaceous discoloration of the globe.",
