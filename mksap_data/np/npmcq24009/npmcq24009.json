  "critique": "The most appropriate management for this patient's elevated blood pressure (BP) is shared decision making (Option C). For older adults, multiple guidelines exist that can assist in management decisions (). These differing recommendations must be balanced with the burden of comorbidity and frailty, daily pill burden, quality of life, and patient preferences. For this patient, a shared decision-making discussion that incorporates guideline recommendations with the patient's level of risk, values, and preferences will help to inform further antihypertensive management decisions.Adjusting medications to target a systolic BP <130 mm Hg (Option A) as recommended by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) without first engaging in shared decision making with this patient is inappropriate. Although this patient may benefit from improved BP control to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the ACC/AHA guidelines also suggest considering comorbid conditions, life expectancy, patient preferences, and risk-benefit ratio before determining individual BP targets.Discontinuing hydrochlorothiazide (Option B) or continuing current medical therapy (Option D) may place this patient at increased risk for cardiovascular events. A discussion regarding the risks and benefits of antihypertensive therapy in the context of differing guidelines as well as patient preferences is needed before making further decisions on antihypertensive management.",
