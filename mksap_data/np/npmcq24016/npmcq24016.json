  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with stage 1 hypertension and a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) ≥10% is to begin a first-line antihypertensive such as amlodipine (Option C). This patient's average blood pressure (BP) measurement by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and office BP measurements taken 3 months apart are consistent with a diagnosis of stage 1 hypertension (). The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guideline recommends lifestyle modifications in addition to pharmacologic treatment for patients with stage 1 hypertension (BP ≥130/80 mm Hg) and clinical cardiovascular disease or a 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥10%; the target office BP goal is <130/80 mm Hg. Recommended first-line agents include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker because these agents have been shown to reduce clinical events. This patient should be started on a first-line antihypertensive such as amlodipine.Observation and rechecking BP in the office in 3 months (Option A) or repeating 24-hour ABPM in 6 months (Option B) could be considered in the setting of white coat hypertension, elevated BP, or stage 1 hypertension with low 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. However, this patient has confirmed stage 1 hypertension associated with a 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥10%; pharmacologic therapy should be initiated now.Although this patient should be started on pharmacologic therapy, clonidine (Option D) and metoprolol (Option E) are not considered first-line antihypertensives. There are not robust data comparing β-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), peripheral- or central-acting α-blockers (e.g., clonidine), vasodilators, aldosterone receptor antagonists, or loop diuretics to the four first-line drug classes previously mentioned. Therefore, these drug classes are not recommended as first-line therapy but can be used if a compelling indication exists (β-blockers for post–myocardial infarction or heart failure; aldosterone receptor blockers for heart failure; loop diuretics for advanced chronic kidney disease) or as add-on therapy for resistant hypertension.",

  "question_text": "A 45-year-old man is evaluated during a follow-up visit for hypertension. At his last office visit 3 months ago, his blood pressure was 136/84 mm Hg. Subsequent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed an average blood pressure of 129/78 mm Hg. He has hyperlipidemia for which he takes atorvastatin. He is a current smoker with a 15-pack-year history.On physical examination, blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 82/min. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.Chemistry panel results are normal, and urine dipstick results show no protein.His calculated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is 13%.Lifestyle modifications and smoking cessation are advised.",
