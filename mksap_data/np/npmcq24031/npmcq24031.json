  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next is lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography (Option C). This patient presents with the nephrotic syndrome, a hypercoagulable state, and has asymmetric lower extremity edema, which is suspicious for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, significant edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia. In addition to albuminuria, patients with the nephrotic syndrome excrete several low-molecular-weight anticoagulants (e.g., antithrombin III, protein S) and fibrinolytics (e.g., plasminogen). Hepatic overproduction of proteins as an intrinsic response to hypoalbuminemia leads to hyperlipidemia and increased levels of procoagulants (e.g., factors V and VIII, fibrinogen). As a result, patients with the nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk for pulmonary, lower extremity, and renal vein thromboses. Clots are most commonly seen in patients with membranous nephropathy, but any patient with nephrotic-range proteinuria and significant hypoalbuminemia (typically serum albumin level <2.5 g/dL [25 g/L]), such as this patient, should be considered at risk, especially early in the course of the disease. Because this patient's presentation is suspicious for DVT, a lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate for DVT is the most appropriate test at this stage.D-dimer level (Option A) will be elevated in inflammatory states such as the nephrotic syndrome and would therefore not be useful as a screening test for DVT in this case.Although this patient will likely need a kidney biopsy (Option B), evaluation for a DVT is more urgent at this time. In addition, if the result of serologic testing for phospholipase A2 receptor antibody is positive and the serum creatinine level remains within normal limits, the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, the most common form of the nephrotic syndrome associated with clots, can be made without the patient undergoing kidney biopsy.If pulmonary embolism is suspected in a patient with normal kidney function, a CT angiography is preferred over ventilation-perfusion scanning (Option D). Initial imaging with lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography is faster and more specific to his examination findings.",
