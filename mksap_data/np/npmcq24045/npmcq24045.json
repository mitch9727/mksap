  "critique": "No further management (Option D) is needed in this patient whose laboratory findings reflect expected physiologic changes in pregnancy. Several normal physiologic changes occur during pregnancy:Sodium and water retention increase plasma volume, augmenting renal blood flow and increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by up to 50%. With the GFR increase, serum creatinine levels decrease.Proteinuria increases, with the upper limit of normal increasing from 150 mg/24 h in nonpregnant individuals to approximately 200 mg/24 h in pregnant individuals. Proteinuria values greater than 300 mg/24 h are considered abnormal.Changes in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response and osmolality (reset osmostat in which the threshold for ADH secretion is lowered) cause mild hyponatremia (decrease in serum sodium of 4.0-5.0 mEq/L [4.0-5.0 mmol/L]) with a decrease in serum osmolality by 8.0 to 10 mOsm/kg HO.Chronic respiratory alkalosis caused by progesterone-induced hyperventilation commonly decreases P to 27 to 32 mm Hg (3.6-4.3 kPa). Kidney compensation results in decreased serum bicarbonate levels between 18 to 20 mEq/L (18-20 mmol/L), with a serum pH of approximately 7.45.This patient is at 12 weeks' gestation, and her serum creatinine level, degree of proteinuria, mild hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis reflect normal physiologic changes during pregnancy; these changes do not require further management.Nephrology consultation (Option A) is not indicated. This patient's laboratory abnormalities are consistent with expected physiologic changes during pregnancy, and no further evaluation is needed.ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril (Option B), are used to slow the progression of kidney disease and treat microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. However, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy because they are teratogenic and should not be used to treat proteinuria in pregnancy. Regardless, in this patient, the proteinuria is most likely a result of pregnancy and not diabetes, because her urine albumin-creatine ratio 3 months ago was normal.Sodium bicarbonate (Option C) may be indicated in some patients with metabolic acidosis. This patient's primary disorder is most likely a respiratory alkalosis with a compensatory metabolic acidosis and is a normal physiologic finding; therefore, no treatment is required.",
