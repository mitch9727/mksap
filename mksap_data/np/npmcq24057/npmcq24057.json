  "question_text": "A 50-year-old woman with alcohol-associated cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus is evaluated in the hospital for acute kidney injury and oliguria. She was admitted 4 days ago with altered mental status, decreased oral intake, and a draining ulcer on her left foot. On admission, a diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole were initiated for the ulcer, and outpatient furosemide and spironolactone were withheld. On hospital day 2, albumin infusions were initiated for 2 days. Other inpatient medications are pantoprazole, lactulose, insulin glargine, and insulin lispro.On physical examination, temperature is 37.7 °C (99.9 °F), blood pressure is 98/68 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 102/min. She has lethargy, confusion, and jaundice. Asterixis is present. The abdomen is protuberant and tense. There is pitting edema to the knees. The left foot has a 4- × 3-cm plantar ulcer draining pus.Laboratory studies:Blood urea nitrogen32 mg/dL (11.4 mmol/L)HCreatinine1.6 mg/dL (141.4 μmol/L)HHospital day 20.9 mg/dL (79.6 μmol/L)Hospital day 10.5 mg/dL (44.2 μmol/L)LSerum sodium128 mEq/L (128 mmol/L)LUrine sodium<20 mEq/L (20 mmol/L)Urinalysis with microscopySpecific gravity 1.030; trace protein; no blood, leukocyte esterase, or nitrites; no cells or castsKidney ultrasound shows normal-sized kidneys without hydronephrosis.",

  "critique": "The most likely cause of this patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is hepatorenal syndrome-AKI (HRS-AKI) (Option C). HRS occurs in the setting of portal hypertension and is characterized by increased renal vasoconstriction and peripheral and splanchnic arterial vasodilation. Tubular function is preserved; hematuria and proteinuria are absent, and urine sodium concentration is typically low. Urine sediment findings associated with HRS and other causes of AKI are described in Table: Causes of Acute Kidney Injury and Urine Sediment Findings. HRS-AKI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is characterized by an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) and/or 50% or higher from baseline within 48 hours, bland urinalysis, and normal kidney ultrasound. Lack of improvement in kidney function after diuretic withdrawal and 2 days of volume expansion with intravenous albumin supports the diagnosis. This patient's urinalysis and kidney ultrasound findings, as well as lack of improvement in serum creatinine despite diuretic withdrawal and albumin infusion, make HRS-AKI likely.In acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) (Option A), urine sediment examination usually reveals leukocytes, erythrocytes, and leukocyte casts. Although ciprofloxacin and pantoprazole are associated with AIN, this patient's urine microscopy findings are not consistent with the diagnosis.Although acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (Option B) due to vancomycin or prerenal azotemia are considerations, ATN is unlikely. ATN is associated with renal tubular epithelial cells and casts and/or coarse granular or muddy brown casts on urine microscopy, which are not seen here.Prerenal AKI (Option D) should be considered given the decreased oral intake, outpatient diuretics, high blood urea nitrogen-to-serum creatinine ratio, urine sodium level <20 mEq/L (20 mmol/L), and bland urinary sediment. However, withdrawal of diuretics and volume expansion with albumin have not improved kidney function, which excludes prerenal AKI and supports HRS-AKI.",
