  "critique": "Cystoscopy (Option A) is the most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient. Hematuria, defined as 3 or more erythrocytes/hpf in the urine sediment, may be microscopic (detectable only on urine testing) or macroscopic (grossly visible). Macroscopic hematuria should prompt urology referral even if self-limited and even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Macroscopic hematuria is most often of nonglomerular origin and may indicate a malignancy. Management is guided by classification of risk for urothelial cancer as low/negligible, intermediate, or high (see ). Patients with low/negligible risk should have a repeat urinalysis within 6 months. Patients with intermediate risk require renal ultrasonography and cystoscopy. Patients with high risk require cystoscopy and CT urography, if there are no contraindications, or MR urography. This woman had an episode of gross hematuria and would be classified as having high risk, so she requires cystoscopy and CT urography.Kidney biopsy (Option B) in a patient with hematuria is not indicated in the absence of evidence of glomerular disease or change in kidney function. This patient's normal kidney function and absence of dysmorphic erythrocytes, erythrocyte casts, or proteinuria rules out a significant glomerular process. Furthermore, this patient has no systemic symptoms to suggest systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune disease that would lead to glomerular hematuria. Her normal serum creatinine level and lack of systemic symptoms make other kidney diseases unlikely.Kidney ultrasonography (Option C) is an appropriate imaging modality for evaluating patients with intermediate risk, but it is not preferred for evaluating high-risk hematuria, as in this patient. Doppler ultrasonography is not indicated because renal vein thrombosis is not suspected (normal kidney function, no flank pain, and no risk factors for thrombosis).Routine cytologic evaluation of urine (Option D) is not recommended in the initial evaluation of hematuria in a high-risk patient, as it does not exclude the need for cystoscopy.",
