  "critique": "Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) (Option A) is the most appropriate way to correct this patient's hyperkalemia in the setting of anuric-oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI). IHD, typically delivered three to six times a week for 3 to 5 hours per session, allows for rapid correction of electrolyte disturbances and rapid removal of drugs or toxins. This patient has severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes, which should be corrected urgently to prevent lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Calcium, insulin, and dextrose are only temporizing measures and will not remove potassium from the body; only dialysis will do so. Continuous kidney replacement therapy, a type of dialysis, might be considered if the patient cannot tolerate IHD, but it removes fluid and solutes at a much slower rate.Intravenous furosemide (Option B) can induce urine potassium loss by increasing urine flow and sodium delivery to the distal nephron for exchange with potassium. However, this patient is nearly anuric and unlikely to respond to furosemide.Sodium bicarbonate (Option C) causes a shift of hydrogen ion from the intracellular fluid compartment to the extracellular compartment, causing an opposing net intracellular potassium shift to maintain electroneutrality. The effect of bicarbonate is transient and ineffective in end-stage kidney disease or severe AKI.Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Option D) is a cation exchange resin that removes potassium through the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of action is hours to days, and its effectiveness is disputed. It is contraindicated in patients such as this with recent bowel surgery because of an increased risk for intestinal necrosis.",
