Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with mutations in the tumor-suppressing genes TSC1 or TSC2 and resulting tumors in many organs, primarily the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin, and lungs. Most patients have cutaneous findings, including hypopigmented macules (ash-leaf spots), angiofibromas, shagreen patches, and fibrous forehead plaques. Epilepsy is present in most patients with tuberous sclerosis, and cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems are also common.",
