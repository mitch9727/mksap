Abdominal CT scan in this patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease shows enlarged kidneys with multiple bilateral cysts (appearing as hypodense lesions), with disruption of the architecture of the left kidney due to large cysts that make it minimally recognizable on imaging. The extent of cyst formation may be appreciated in the coronal view, as shown above. The image shown below illustrates the gross pathologic appearance of polycystic kidneys.",
