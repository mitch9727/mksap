  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is acute tubular necrosis (Option B). Urinalysis with microscopic examination of urine sediment can provide clues to the cause of acute kidney injury. This patient's urine sediment shows multiple pigmented granular (muddy brown) casts, which are highly suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. The backbone of all urine casts is a matrix composed of Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin). These cylindric casts form in the distal tubular lumen. Necrotic cells and debris, originating in the more proximal parts of the nephron, are also present within the casts. The severity of acute kidney injury correlates with the number of casts and presence of renal tubular epithelial cells.",
