  "critique": "Hypertensive retinopathy (Option B) is most compatible with the funduscopic findings shown. This funduscopic examination shows the generalized arteriolar narrowing (white arrows) compared with venule diameter (black arrows) characteristic of hypertensive retinopathy. The degree of retinal arterial narrowing is assessed by comparing arteriolar diameter relative to retinal venule diameter (arteriole-to-venule ratio); venule diameters do not vary substantially in most patients with hypertension. An arteriole-to-venule ratio less than 2:3, which is present in this case, suggests relative arteriolar narrowing. Arteriolar narrowing is associated with an increased risk for stroke. Evidence also indicates that arteriolar narrowing is associated with coronary artery disease and kidney damage. The finding of hypertensive retinopathy is usually indicative of several years of uncontrolled hypertension.",
