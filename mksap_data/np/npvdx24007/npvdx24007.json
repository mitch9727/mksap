  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is fibromuscular dysplasia (Option B). The patient's renal angiogram shows typical fibromuscular disease manifested by the \"string of beads\" sign. Kidney duplex ultrasonography is a reasonable imaging modality for suspected renovascular hypertension if performed by an experienced sonographer. Magnetic resonance or CT angiography has higher diagnostic utility but can be harmful in patients with severe chronic kidney disease given the risk for contrast nephropathy and gadolinium-induced nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Kidney intra-arterial angiography is the gold standard and can be considered if results of other noninvasive tests are negative, clinical suspicion is high, and an invasive procedure is contemplated.",
