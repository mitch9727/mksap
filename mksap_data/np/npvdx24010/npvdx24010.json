  "critique": "The abdominal CT scan demonstrates hydronephrosis (Option A) of the right kidney. Also depicted is cortical thinning of the right kidney, best seen on coronal imaging (shown below), suggesting that the hydronephrosis has been chronic.Ultrasonography is the preferred initial diagnostic study for most patients to evaluate for hydronephrosis, although CT may be indicated if an obstructing stone is suspected or in patients with anatomically abnormal kidneys (such as in polycystic kidney disease), in whom ultrasonography results may be difficult to interpret. CT may also be indicated in patients with hydronephrosis detected by ultrasonography to help define a cause of hydronephrosis, such as distal ureteral obstruction, that may be more effectively seen on CT.",
