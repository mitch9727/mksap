  "critique": "The most likely cause of this patient's renal calculi is struvite (Option C). Struvite crystals typically have a “coffin lid” appearance.Struvite stones occur in the presence of urea-splitting bacteria, such as Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Ureaplasma, or Staphylococcus species. These bacteria split urea into ammonium, which markedly increases urine pH and results in the precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite); the urine pH will be greater than 7.5. Struvite stones commonly produce staghorn calculi (stones that bridge two or more renal calyces) and occur most frequently in older women with chronic urinary tract infections. Because struvite stones are large and grow rapidly, they do not pass into the ureter to cause pain typical of smaller stones.",
