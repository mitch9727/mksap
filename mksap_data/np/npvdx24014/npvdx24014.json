The optic fundus shows changes of arteriosclerosis, which is characterized by arteriovenous nicking and arteriolar narrowing. Nicking is defined as the disappearance of a short segment of the venule where it is crossed by the arteriole and by a 90°-angle crossing of the arterioles and venules. The white arrow in the image shown identifies an area of nicking. Narrowed arterioles may appear as a \"copper wire.\" Retinal arteriosclerotic changes are seen in hypertensive retinopathy.",
