Oval fat bodies are a hallmark finding in the nephrotic syndrome, and the Maltese cross pattern is seen only under polarized light. Patients typically describe slowly progressive edema, and laboratory testing reveals proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia; serum creatinine level is rarely elevated.",
