  "critique": "Calcium oxalate (Option A) is the most likely composition of this patient's kidney stone. The urine sediment shown contains envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals, which are associated with hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate stone formation. These crystals can also be seen with ethylene glycol ingestion. Hyperoxaluria can be primary (genetic enzyme deficiency) or can result from increased dietary oxalate intake or absorption; decreased calcium in the gastrointestinal tract (as occurs with a low-calcium diet); or binding of calcium to fatty acids (as occurs with malabsorption syndromes). It can also occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery or with use of the weight-loss drug orlistat, which allows increased absorption of oxalate. Additionally, high intake of vitamin C, which is metabolized to oxalate, can cause hyperoxaluria.",
