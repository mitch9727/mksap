  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is osteitis fibrosa cystica (Option B). In this patient's radiograph, the humerus shows changes of osteitis fibrosa cystica characterized by bone cysts and radiolucent lytic areas of the long bones caused by brown tumors. Brown tumors represent a collection of osteoclasts and fibrous material that appears brown secondary to hemosiderin deposition. Other classic radiographic skeletal changes include subperiosteal resorption of bone, most prominently at the phalanges of the hands, as shown.Osteitis fibrosa cystica is caused by abnormally high bone turnover in secondary hyperparathyroidism and increases the risk for fracture. Patients can be asymptomatic, or they may have bone pain.",
