  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is medullary nephrocalcinosis (Option B). Sjögren disease is a common cause of type 1 (hypokalemic distal) renal tubular acidosis. In type 1 renal tubular acidosis, hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia result from increased calcium and phosphate release from bone due to buffering of acid. Reduced tubular calcium resorption in the context of acidosis exacerbates hypercalciuria. Increased proximal reabsorption of citrate in the context of acidosis and hypokalemia causes hypocitraturia. Citrate usually inhibits calcium crystallization; therefore, hypocitraturia, in addition to hypercalciuria, increases the risk for calcium phosphate stones and nephrocalcinosis.",
