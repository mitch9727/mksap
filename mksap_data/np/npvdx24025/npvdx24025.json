  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is IgA vasculitis (Option B) (also known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura), which presents with the classic tetrad of rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and kidney disease. The characteristic rash begins as crops of erythematous patches, which eventually coalesce and develop into painless, palpable purpura. Dependent areas, such as the lower extremities, are most commonly affected. In children, the diagnosis is often made empirically because the differential diagnosis of vasculitis in this population is extremely limited. In adults, however, the diagnosis should be confirmed with tissue biopsy (kidney or skin) because the presentation of IgA vasculitis can be mimicked by other forms of vasculitis. Adults with IgA vasculitis have higher rates of kidney involvement than do children.",
