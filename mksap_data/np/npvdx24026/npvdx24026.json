  "critique": "Cystine stones (Option B) are a relatively uncommon type of stone and result from cystinuria, an autosomal recessive disease. Patients commonly present in childhood or adolescence. The diagnosis should be suspected in young patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis or with a strong family history of nephrolithiasis. Cystine stones are recognized by pathognomonic hexagonal crystals in the urine. They may also form staghorn calculi and are less radio-opaque than calcium-containing stones.",
