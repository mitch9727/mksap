  "question_text": "A 55-year-old woman is evaluated for a change in headache pattern. She has a 35-year history of migraine. Initially, her headaches were infrequent, hemicranial, throbbing, and preceded by a homonymous visual scotoma. She had associated photophobia and nausea. Over the last 9 months, she has developed daily headaches. These headaches are holocranial and aching, without migrainous, autonomic, or neurologic features. Approximately twice a week, she has severe headaches that are typical of her longstanding migraines. She takes naproxen once or twice weekly, when a headache limits her ability to work. She takes no other medications.Vital signs and other physical examination findings, including results of funduscopic and neurologic examinations, are unremarkable.A brain MRI is normal.",

  "critique": "This patient with a history of typical migraines and evolution of daily headache, in the absence of medication overuse, likely has chronic migraine (Option A). Chronic migraine is defined as a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that meets full migraine criteria on at least 8 of those days or responds to migraine-specific medication (triptans or ergot alkaloid derivatives). Most patients describe the milder pain on the other headache days as often lacking typical migraine features or severity. Transformation from episodic to chronic migraine occurs at an annual rate of about 3%. Risk factors are older age, female sex, head trauma, major life stressors, obesity, chronic pain, mood and anxiety disorders, and inadequate acute migraine management. Medication or caffeine overuse and nicotine use also increase the transformation risk. Chronic migraines require holistic management, including reduction or avoidance of triggers. Pharmacologic therapies for prevention include β-blockers, topiramate, migraine-specific monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor, and CGRP receptor agonists. This patient has risk factors for migraine transformation, and she meets the criteria for chronic migraine.Hemicrania continua (Option B) is a continuous unilateral headache that is unremitting for longer than 3 months. Because it is accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic features, this headache type is categorized with cluster headache as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia. This patient's headaches lack the pain characteristics and autonomic features of hemicrania continua.Medication overuse headache (Option C) results from frequent use of analgesic medications in some patients with migraine or tension-type headache. Medication overuse is defined as the use of triptans, ergot alkaloids, opioids, or combination analgesics 10 or more days per month or simple analgesics 15 or more days per month. This patient's twice-weekly use of a simple analgesic does not constitute medication overuse.Chronic tension-type headache (Option D) is defined as long-lasting or unremitting headaches occurring at least 15 days per month, accompanied by pain with at least two of the following characteristics: bilateral location, pressing or tightening quality, mild or moderate intensity, and absence of aggravation by routine physical activity. No more than one of the features of photophobia or phonophobia may be present, and the headache cannot be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. This patient has severe pain and photophobia during her worst episodes, precluding the diagnosis of chronic tension-type headache.",
