He did not seek medical care at the time of the injury. Since the collision, he has had episodic dizziness and recurrent headaches lasting minutes to hours. Symptoms are gradually improving but have not completely resolved. He has no medical conditions and takes no medications.Physical examination findings, including vital signs and results of a neurologic examination, are normal.",

  "critique": "This patient who sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) should avoid returning to sports until his symptoms have completely resolved (Option A), at which point exercise may be reintroduced gradually. Mild TBI, also known as concussion, typically causes temporary neurologic impairment without evidence of structural damage on neuroimaging (if indicated). Symptoms are typically physical (e.g., headache and vomiting), cognitive (e.g., poor concentration and confusion), emotional (e.g., depression and anxiety), or related to sleep (e.g., insomnia and fatigue). Next to accidents, sporting activities are the second most common source of TBI in young adults. When TBI is suspected, athletes must be removed immediately from play. Patients should be advised to exercise as tolerated after 1 to 2 days of rest and to escalate mental activities after 3 to 5 days. Return to sport should occur only after the patient has had complete resolution of symptoms, normalization of physical examination findings (if initially present), and tolerance for usual daily activities. Full return to high-impact play should occur only after a patient is asymptomatic and demonstrates tolerance for a gradual reintroduction of exercise.Although this patient is improving rapidly, he remains symptomatic, so he should not yet return to play (Option B).Indications for head CT (Option C) in the setting of acute head injury include older age, severe symptoms, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 15, focal neurologic findings, posttraumatic seizure, coagulopathy, persistent drowsiness or amnesia, or certain dangerous mechanisms of injury (such as a fall from height or ejection from a vehicle). This patient does not meet criteria for neuroimaging.Neuropsychological testing (Option D) is indicated in the assessment of patients with persistent symptoms 4 to 6 weeks after a mild TBI. This patient is recovering quickly and does not require further evaluation at this time.",
