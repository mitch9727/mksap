  "question_text": "A 72-year-old man is evaluated for progressive walking difficulties and imbalance that started 3 to 4 months ago. He also reports chronic mild neck stiffness. He drinks one to two alcoholic beverages each day. Medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Medications are metformin, empagliflozin, valsartan, and atorvastatin.On physical examination, vital signs are within normal limits. Grip strength is 4+/5 bilaterally; otherwise, strength is 5/5 in the arms and legs. Sensation to pinprick is diminished in a gradient to both knees. Sensation to vibration is diminished to the knees and absent to the ankles bilaterally. Biceps and patellar reflexes are 3+ with 5 beats of clonus at both ankles. Hoffman sign is positive. Gait is wide based and ataxic.Laboratory studies:Vitamin B12502 pg/mL (370 pmol/L)Hemoglobin A1c6.8%H",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next is MRI of the cervical spine (Option D) to assess possible spinal stenosis and myelopathy. Chronic compressive myelopathy may be caused by spinal stenosis due to osteoarthritic spinal disease. It most often affects the cervical and lumbar regions, and thoracic cord involvement is rare. The presentation of chronic myelopathy is variable and includes progressive weakness, spasticity, distal numbness, and bladder impairment; it should be considered in older patients with gait dysfunction or weakness. Some with lumbar stenosis describe symptoms similar to vascular claudication (pseudoclaudication) with exertional groin, thigh, or buttock pain. Compressive myelopathy is an upper motor neuron process. Examination reveals upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses), but lower motor neuron signs (atrophy, hyporeflexia) can occur near the level of compression. MRI of the spinal cord with and without contrast at the suspected region of compression is the preferred means of diagnosing compressive myelopathy. In this patient with neck pain and sensory ataxia, MRI of the cervical spine is the best test to assess whether myelopathy from cervical stenosis is present.Electromyography/nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCSs) (Option A) may be able to indicate whether a peripheral neuropathy is contributing to this patient's presentation, particularly given his risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus and alcohol use. However, EMG/NCSs are not a primary test for assessing possible myelopathy, and they would not determine the cause of this patient's myelopathy, if present.Lumbar puncture with high-volume cerebrospinal fluid removal (Option B) would be a reasonable test if normal-pressure hydrocephalus were a leading possibility. Although normal-pressure hydrocephalus does present with gait abnormalities, it often has concomitant cognitive changes and urinary incontinence, neither of which is present in this patient.Methylmalonic acid measurement (Option C) may help determine the likelihood of vitamin B12 deficiency when vitamin B12 levels are borderline low. This patient, however, has a high-normal serum vitamin B12 level, and deficiency is unlikely to be causing this patient's symptoms. Additionally, although vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a sensory ataxia secondary to dorsal column involvement, it would not typically cause hyperreflexia.",
