  "question_text": "A 62-year-old woman is evaluated for a 1-year history of progressive weakness in her right upper extremity. She has noticed problems with fine motor tasks, such as buttoning or opening a bottle, and her handwriting has become smaller. Her grip remains strong, and she reports no sensory loss. She has no other medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The examination reveals normal muscle strength in individual muscles. On the right side of her body, muscle tone is increased in the right upper extremity, and rapid alternating movements are slow and decrementing in amplitude. There is no atrophy, sensory loss, or tremor. Deep tendon reflexes are normal.MRI of the brain is normal.",

  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is Parkinson disease (Option D). Most patients with Parkinson disease describe subjective “weakness” resulting from slowness and stiffness rather than loss of strength in individual muscles. Common findings in Parkinson disease include the presence of asymmetric bradykinesia (decreasing amplitude of repetitive movements), rigidity (increased tone), and micrographia (small handwriting). Importantly, the absence of tremor does not rule out Parkinson disease; one third of patients never develop tremor. A clear therapeutic response to levodopa is highly supportive of the diagnosis. Alternatively, a lack of response to increasing dosages from a starting point of 500 mg/d to 1000 mg/d for at least 1 month makes the diagnosis of Parkinson disease highly unlikely. This patient demonstrates asymmetric bradykinesia, rigidity, and micrographia as well as normal strength on examination, all of which are consistent with the diagnosis of Parkinson disease.Patients with brachial plexitis (Option A) present with subacute scapular pain associated with weakness and atrophy in the muscles of the shoulder girdle and upper extremities. Systemic infection, surgery, and trauma are common predisposing conditions. The lack of pain, normal strength, and normal muscle bulk make brachial plexitis an unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms.Cervical myelopathy (Option B) can cause asymmetric weakness, but objective muscle strength weakness is usually present on examination. Other findings absent in this patient that would suggest cervical myelopathy include neck pain, sensory changes, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses.Weakness in myasthenia gravis (Option C) is symmetric and typically involves proximal muscles and the oculomotor and bulbar regions. Patients with myasthenia experience fluctuating weakness, so it is possible for muscle strength to appear normal on examination despite subjective report of intermittent weakness. However, some features of this patient's condition, such as increased muscle tone, micrographia, and asymmetry, are not expected in patients with myasthenia.",
