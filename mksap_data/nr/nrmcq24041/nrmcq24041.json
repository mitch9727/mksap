  "question_text": "A 72-year-old patient is evaluated in the emergency department for sudden-onset confusion of 3 hours' duration. The patient is accompanied by their daughter, who has lived with them for the past 2 years to assist with daily activities. The daughter reports that the patient is typically oriented to place but not time or date and has poor short-term memory. The patient is usually calm and cooperative but woke up this morning agitated and unable to recognize their daughter; they tried to leave their home wearing only their pajamas. Medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease, and their only medication is donepezil.On examination, the patient is anxious and agitated. They refuse to answer questions or let anyone perform additional evaluation.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step is redirection and reassurance (Option D). Delirium is a common cause of behavioral changes in dementia; patients with dementia are especially susceptible to delirium given their already decreased cognitive reserves and cognitive vulnerability to minor infectious, metabolic, electrolyte, and iatrogenic changes. Therefore, a full medical evaluation is warranted in the setting of behavioral changes; however, symptoms of delirium can pose a challenge to obtaining a medically appropriate evaluation for management. When a patient with dementia exhibits behavioral symptoms, nonpharmacologic behavioral interventions are first-line therapy. Distraction; redirection; calm, reassuring responses to anxious comments and gestures; and a calm, soothing environment are often enough to elicit cooperation from the patient. Physical restraints and pharmacologic treatment should be avoided. This patient with Alzheimer disease is at increased risk for delirium, which is the most likely cause of their sudden-onset confusion. Calm redirection and reassurance may allow for further examination to diagnose and manage the underlying medical condition that is likely causing the delirium.Benzodiazepines like diazepam (Option A) are a common cause of delirium in patients with dementia and should be avoided as a means of behavior management. Instead of improving behavioral symptoms, these medications may worsen confusion, delay care, and result in prolonged hospitalization.If nonpharmacologic behavioral interventions are unsuccessful and severe refractory agitation or behavioral symptoms are delaying care, treatment with the minimum effective dose of an antipsychotic like haloperidol (Option B) can be considered. Typical and atypical antipsychotics, however, have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality in patients with dementia and should be used very sparingly.Physically restraining (Option C) an agitated patient with dementia may exacerbate their behavior and increases the likelihood of escalation of care. Escalating care often requires more staff assistance and increases the likelihood of administration of pharmacologic measures, which should be avoided if at all possible.",
