  "question_text": "A 65-year-old man is evaluated for a 7-month history of short-term memory loss. His daughter says that he has become increasingly less social over the past year and now spends most of his day at home watching television. She notes that he goes days without bathing or changing his clothes, and she recently started bringing him meals because of noticeable weight loss over the past few months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 23/30; he has difficulty drawing the hands on a clock and recalls all five words only with clues and choices. The remainder of the neurologic examination is normal. He is mildly depressed, with a PHQ-9 score of 6.Results of laboratory studies, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and serum vitamin B12 levels, are normal.Sertraline is initiated.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step is further evaluation with brain MRI (Option B). The differential diagnosis for cognitive impairment is very broad and includes vascular, inflammatory, metabolic, and oncologic causes. When evaluating a patient with cognitive impairment, the diagnostic process includes a full clinical history, cognitive testing, neuroimaging, and laboratory studies. Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count; metabolic profile; and serum vitamin B12, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Syphilis testing with a treponemal antibody test should be considered in patients who are at high risk. A brain MRI should also be performed; if brain MRI is contraindicated, then head CT is appropriate. Such an evaluation is necessary even when cognitive impairment occurs concurrently with mood and behavioral disturbances. Depression itself is a common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults but can also accompany other causes. This patient has significant cognitive impairment and should undergo neuroimaging with brain MRI in addition to the laboratory testing already completed.Amyloid PET scan (Option A) is not a component of the initial evaluation of possible dementia and should not be done in this patient. Amyloid PET scans assess the degree of amyloid deposition in the brain and may support a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease but are not currently indicated in this patient.Lumbar puncture (Option C) can be used when an inflammatory or infectious cause of cognitive changes is suspected or, in some patients when the diagnosis is uncertain, to evaluate possible Alzheimer disease. Performing a lumbar puncture without the clinical presentation or imaging suggesting an inflammatory or infectious cause, however, would be premature in this patient.Depression is a common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults, and the sertraline may help treat this patient's mild depression. However, further evaluation is needed to determine whether depression is a prodromal symptom of a degenerative disorder, the result of structural changes, or a primary psychiatric disorder (Option D).",
