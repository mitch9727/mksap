  "question_text": "A 77-year-old woman is evaluated for a 6-week history of intermittent headaches and blurry vision. The headaches consist of mild holocranial aching and occur nearly daily. Associated symptoms include neck pain, mild photophobia, and horizontal diplopia. Her family notes that she is occasionally confused and believes that she is sleeping excessively. She has had no trauma other than a fall on an icy sidewalk 6 weeks ago. Medical history is remarkable only for alcohol use disorder, although she has abstained for 5 years. She takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are symmetric; ptosis is absent. She has mild papilledema and exhibits partial right cranial nerve VI palsy. Tandem gait is ataxic.",

  "critique": "Recurrent headaches with focal neurologic signs and symptoms in an older patient after a fall are highly suggestive of a subdural hematoma (Option D). In a subdural hematoma, blood collects in the subdural space after tearing of the bridging veins, which become stretched with aging and cerebral atrophy. An age older than 60 years, coagulopathy or anticoagulant use, and a history of alcohol use disorder are risk factors. Presentations may be acute, subacute, or chronic. With chronic subdural hematoma, the most common symptoms are headache, altered mental status, dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and vomiting. Among focal findings, the presence of papilledema and a “falsely localizing” cranial nerve VI palsy indicate elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Neuroimaging is required to confirm the diagnosis. Management may be supportive and focused on symptoms for patients with small hematomas and limited functional impairment. In patients with chronic hematomas, a hematoma thicker than 10 mm, a midline shift greater than 5 mm, and significant neurologic compromise are all indications for neurosurgical drainage. This patient had a remote fall and now has daily headaches, neck pain, and signs of increased ICP. A subdural hematoma is the most likely diagnosis.Epidural hematoma (Option A) typically presents as a neurologic emergency in association with acute trauma. Most patients present with a brief “lucid interval,” lasting minutes to hours, followed by rapid and dramatic neurologic compromise over several hours. Headache with nausea and vomiting is followed by mental status deterioration and often stupor and coma. Ipsilateral cranial nerve III palsy and contralateral hemiparesis indicate transtentorial (uncal) herniation. Diagnosis is confirmed by noncontrast head CT. Most patients require urgent surgical evacuation.An intracranial tumor (Option B) may account for many of this patient's symptoms, including the headaches and signs of increased ICP. Given her recent fall, alcohol use disorder, and the lack of medical illness predisposing her to an intracranial mass lesion, such as malignancy, a subdural hematoma is a more likely diagnosis.Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (Option C) typically presents as thunderclap headache (reaching maximum intensity within 1 minute), neck pain or stiffness, nausea and vomiting, and sometimes loss of consciousness. This patient's subacute presentation over the course of 6 weeks is inconsistent with SAH.",
