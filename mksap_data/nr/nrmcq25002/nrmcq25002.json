  "question_text": "An 18-year-old man is evaluated for a history of daily staring episodes. The episodes occur without warning and last 5 to 10 seconds. He is unaware of the events, as he will continue previous conversations or activities immediately after they end. The episodes are so frequent that he cannot pay attention in his classes, and his academic performance has suffered. Medical history is significant for a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure 6 months ago. He takes no medications.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal.",

  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is absence seizures (Option A). These seizures are characterized by staring episodes that are typically brief (lasting <15 seconds), occur without an aura or warning, have no postictal confusion, and are frequent (occurring daily or multiple times a day). Absence seizures are generalized seizures; patients do not have awareness during them and may not recall that they are occurring. Absence seizures may also be associated with other generalized seizure types, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures. They may occur as the only seizure type in school-aged children and are often confused with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or focal impaired consciousness seizures, but they are also commonly seen in young adult–onset epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. This patient has brief staring spells of which he is unaware and that occur without warning and without postictal symptoms. This clinical presentation is most consistent with absence seizures.Like absence seizures, atonic seizures (Option B) may occur without warning and have no postictal confusion. However, patients with atonic seizures experience a sudden loss of muscle tone that often results in a fall. Additionally, atonic seizures are even more brief than absence seizures, often lasting less than 2 seconds. This patient's symptoms are not consistent with atonic seizures, as atonic seizures would not explain his staring episodes, altered awareness, or abrupt cessation of speech or behavior.Focal impaired consciousness seizures (Option C) may also present as staring episodes and must be distinguished from absence seizures. In contrast to absence seizures, focal impaired consciousness seizures are longer (>30 seconds in duration), often have a preceding aura or warning, are infrequent (weekly or monthly), and usually include postevent confusion or disorientation (Table: Differentiation of Seizure Types Presenting as Staring Episodes). The shorter duration, frequent occurrence, and lack of warning or postictal confusion of this patient's staring episodes make focal impaired consciousness seizures an unlikely cause.Focal preserved consciousness seizures (Option D) are localized seizures that have varying symptoms and physical manifestations depending on the site of origin in the brain. By definition, awareness is always preserved in these seizures, so staring and altered awareness should not occur. A diagnosis of focal preserved consciousness seizures would not explain this patient's symptoms.",
