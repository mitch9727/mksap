  "question_text": "A 51-year-old woman is evaluated for increasingly poor ambulation since being diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis 4 years ago. She has been taking ocrelizumab, baclofen for multiple sclerosis–related spasticity, and a vitamin D supplement since that time.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Muscle strength is 4/5 in the left hip flexor, knee flexor, and ankle dorsiflexor. Gait is slow and deliberate with the assistance of a cane; left leg swing is noted. All other physical examination findings are unremarkable.",

  "critique": "This patient should receive dalfampridine (Option A). She has primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) with increasingly poor ambulation. Maintaining mobility in patients with MS is essential for maintaining overall quality of life, and an active, healthy lifestyle can help stave off future disability. Physical therapy is useful to ensure gait safety and improve walking ability and endurance. Assistive aids, such as braces, canes, walkers, and electrostimulatory walk-assist devices, can be useful for many patients. Dalfampridine, a voltage-gated potassium channel antagonist, has been shown to be effective in improving walking speed, leg strength, and gait in patients with MS and impaired gait. This medication theoretically helps boost conductance through demyelinated axonal pathways, which may provide greatest benefit to long axons, such as those providing motor signals to the legs. Dalfampridine should be avoided in patients with epilepsy and kidney impairment.Dextromethorphan-quinidine (Option B), used off-label in MS, is effective against pseudobulbar affect, a less common symptom related to MS, which manifests as uncontrolled fits of laughter or crying without distinct or appropriate triggers. This symptom can act as a significant impediment to social interaction in patients with MS. Given that this patient is not experiencing pseudobulbar affect, use of dextromethorphan-quinidine would not be appropriate.Memantine (Option C) is used frequently in moderate to severe Alzheimer disease to boost cognition but has not been shown to improve cognitive dysfunction or gait impairment in patients with MS.Modafinil (Option D) is frequently used to treat MS-related fatigue but has no impact on muscle strength or walking ability.",
