Her boyfriend says she has periods of wide-eyed staring, chewing motions, and repetitive grabbing of her clothes with the right hand. The patient sometimes experiences a strange but familiar feeling before the episodes but does not remember the episodes themselves, which last approximately 45 to 60 seconds and are followed by exhaustion and sleepiness for 20 minutes.All physical examination findings are normal.",

  "critique": "This patient is experiencing focal impaired consciousness seizures (formerly called focal unaware, complex partial, focal impaired awareness, or focal dyscognitive seizures) (Option C). These seizures typically are infrequent, are associated with “warning” symptoms (aura, which may consist of an epigastric rising sensation or a feeling of déjà vu), last longer than 30 seconds, have associated mouth or limb automatisms (semipurposeful repetitive movements), and are followed by confusion or exhaustion. Patients who experience this type of seizure often have no memory of the episode itself.Absence seizures (Option A), a type of generalized-onset seizure, may also present with staring and confusion but typically are more frequent (occurring multiple times per day), last less than 15 seconds, and are associated with immediate recovery, to the point that patients and witnesses may not realize a seizure has occurred. Absence seizures are most characteristic of childhood absence epilepsy, which typically resolves by puberty, but can also occur in adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes.Atonic seizures (Option B) involve the abrupt loss of muscle tone and typically are associated with falling down and a brief loss of consciousness lasting only a few seconds. Atonic seizures are one cause of “drop attacks,” in which the patient will suddenly, and without warning symptoms, drop to the ground. Persons with drop attacks can rise on their own and typically report no loss of consciousness. Other causes of drop attacks include cataplexy, vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack, and vestibular pathologies. This patient's episodes last approximately 45 to 60 seconds and are followed by exhaustion and sleepiness for 20 minutes. This pattern is not consistent with atonic seizures.Myoclonic seizures (Option D) generally consist of a single jerk of the entire body or a limb, usually last less than 1 second, and are associated with retained awareness and no postictal confusion. This pattern is not consistent with this patient's presentation.",
