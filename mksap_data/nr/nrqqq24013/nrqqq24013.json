  "question_text": "A 35-year-old man is evaluated for a 3-year history of epilepsy. Seizures typically occur twice monthly, last 2 minutes, and are characterized by staring, lip smacking, and confusion; approximately once every 6 months, the patient experiences a whole-body convulsion marked by incontinence and prolonged confusion for several hours. Treatment with oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine has been largely ineffective. He no longer drives or works because of the seizures.On physical examination, vital signs and results of a neurologic examination are normal.Results of routine outpatient electroencephalography (EEG) are normal. Brain MRI shows right hippocampal atrophy.",

  "critique": "This patient is having ongoing focal impaired consciousness seizures (formerly called focal unaware, complex partial, or focal impaired awareness seizures) due to temporal lobe epilepsy despite taking two antiseizure drugs and should be referred to an epilepsy center for video electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring (Option D). Because his epilepsy is drug resistant, he may be a candidate for epilepsy surgery. In appropriately chosen surgical candidates, particularly patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, resection can lead to seizure freedom in 60% to 70% of patients. Video EEG is the first step in determining candidacy for surgery by confirming that the seizures seen on video EEG match the location of abnormal findings on MRI. Video EEG should be performed next in this patient with drug-resistant epilepsy.Although levetiracetam (Option A) and topiramate (Option B) are reasonable options for treating focal impaired consciousness seizures, the chance of seizure freedom from an additional drug is less than 10%. Therefore, these medications are unlikely to be effective management options for this patient.Vagus nerve stimulation (Option C) is a palliative measure and is unlikely to result in seizure freedom. It should be offered only if resection is not an option.",
