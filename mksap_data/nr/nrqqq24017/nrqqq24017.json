  "question_text": "A 76-year-old man is evaluated for recent worsening of balance. He reports no dizziness or lightheadedness. He has an 8-year history of Parkinson disease treated with carbidopa-levodopa and entacapone.On physical examination, vital signs are normal; no orthostatic decrease in blood pressure is noted. The patient has masked facies, a resting tremor, and bradykinesia. No choreiform dyskinesia is noted on examination. Gait assessment reveals mild shuffling without freezing. Findings from cognitive, cerebellar, sensory, and reflex examinations are unremarkable.",

  "critique": "The pull test (Option B), which is the most sensitive predictor of the risk for backward falls in patients with Parkinson disease, should be performed next for this patient. During this test of postural stability, the examiner throws the patient off balance by pulling backward on the patient's shoulders; the test is considered positive if the patient topples into the examiner's arms or takes more than two corrective steps. Additional factors, including insufficient control of motor symptoms, dyskinesia, and orthostatic hypotension, can also contribute to falls in Parkinson disease. In this patient without any evidence of freezing of gait or lower body dyskinesia, the pull test would be appropriate to assess for postural instability.The head impulse (or thrust) test (Option A) involves asking the patient to focus visually on a distant object; the examiner then suddenly turns the head approximately 20 degrees. An abnormal response, indicating a peripheral vestibular lesion, is movement of the eyes off of the target followed by jerking of the eyes back to the target (corrective saccade). This patient's lack of vertigo and dizziness makes a vestibular cause less likely and testing unnecessary.A positive Romberg test (Option C), defined as severe unsteadiness elicited by eye closure in a patient standing comfortably, indicates impairment of large sensory pathways at the spinal cord or peripheral nerve level. The absence of abnormal findings on sensory and reflex examinations makes a sensory ataxia less likely in this patient.Tandem gait (Option D), in which a patient walks in a straight line, may be intact in the early phase of Parkinson disease. An impaired tandem gait, however, can indicate cerebellar or sensory ataxia or other causes of imbalance but is not a sensitive or specific predictor of backward falls.",
