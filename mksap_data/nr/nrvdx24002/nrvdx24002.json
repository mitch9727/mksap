The defining characteristics of neurofibromatosis type 1 (von Recklinghausen disease) are multiple cutaneous neurofibromas (benign nerve sheath tumors), café au lait macules, iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), and axillary/groin freckles. Cutaneous neurofibromas are recognized as soft, sessile, or pedunculated tumors, with most occurring on the trunk. They may vary in number from just a few to several hundred, and they increase in number and size with age. They do not carry malignant risk but may be cosmetically significant. Other manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 include hypertension, epilepsy, malignancies (soft tissue sarcomas, central nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors), and cognitive deficits.",
