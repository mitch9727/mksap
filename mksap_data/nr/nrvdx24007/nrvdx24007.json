  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is subdural hematoma (Option D). Subdural hematoma is readily visualized on CT scan of the head as a high-density crescentic collection across the hemispheric convexity. Subacute and chronic subdural hematomas may appear as isodense or hypodense crescent-shaped lesions that deform the surface of the brain. The images shown below reveal a crescentic lesion over the left hemisphere (red arrows). In contrast to a subdural hematoma, an epidural hematoma produces a convex pattern inward toward the brain parenchyma on CT scan because expansion of the hematoma is limited by firm dural attachments at the cranial sutures in the epidural space.",
