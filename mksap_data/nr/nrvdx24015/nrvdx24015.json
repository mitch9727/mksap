  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is epidural hematoma (Option A). This patient's CT demonstrates the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma with a hyperdense collection with a convex appearance. An epidural hematoma arises when an arterial structure is breached and blood collects between the dura mater and skull in this “lentiform” fashion. Lateral extension is limited by dural attachments at the skull sutures, and expansion occurs inward toward the brain parenchyma. Most epidural hematomas involve a laceration of the middle meningeal artery from a temporal bone fracture.",
