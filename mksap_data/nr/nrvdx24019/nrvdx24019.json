  "critique": "This patient has a subdural hematoma (Option D). Subdural hematomas may occur as a result of acute trauma with bleeding from the subdural veins and resultant accumulation of blood in the subdural space. The blood tracks along the subdural space and is seen as a crescentic high-attenuation finding along the exterior of the brain parenchyma (white arrow). When large, a subdural hematoma may cause significant brain edema and midline shift (yellow arrow). In contrast, epidural hematomas are seen as lentiform densities external to the dura, as spread of the blood is limited by the dural sutures. Intracerebral hemorrhage appears as blood within the brain parenchyma, whereas the blood in subarachnoid hemorrhages is seen in the subarachnoid space and sometimes the ventricles.",
