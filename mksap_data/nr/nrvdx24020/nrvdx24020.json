Multiple sclerosis is characterized by inflammatory damage to the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves with clinical symptoms caused by interruption of axonal pathways by inflammatory lesions. These lesions may be seen on a standardized brain MRI protocol as well as spinal cord imaging. This MRI demonstrates the periventricular demyelinating plaques (arrow) of multiple sclerosis, seen as hyperintense lesions on FLAIR sequence.",
