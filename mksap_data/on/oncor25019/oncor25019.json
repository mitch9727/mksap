  "question_text": "An 18-year-old woman is hospitalized for a 1-month history of night sweats, weight loss of 4.5 kg (10.0 lb), and new jaw mass which has increased in size. She emigrated to the United States 2 years ago from Papua New Guinea. She has no medical conditions and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. She has a palpable left jaw soft tissue mass that is approximately 8 cm in diameter. Cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy is observed.Laboratory studies:Hemoglobin9.8 g/dL (98 g/L)LLeukocyte count15,000/μL (15 × 109/L)HPlatelet count75,000/μL (75 × 109/L)LCreatinine0.8 mg/dL (70.7 µmol/L)Lactate dehydrogenase350 U/LHCT scan shows a 3-cm left cervical lymph node conglomerate and 8-cm left jaw mass. Biopsy of the left jaw soft tissue mass reveals a monomorphic, intermediate-size mature lymphocytes. Genetic testing reveals translocation of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with Burkitt lymphoma is Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Option B). The endemic form of Burkitt lymphoma is a common cause of pediatric and adolescent cancer and is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. It is endemic in areas where malaria is holoendemic, such as Papua New Guinea and equatorial Africa, although the exact mechanism of this prevalence is not clearly understood. It commonly presents as a rapidly expanding jaw mass, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and night sweats. Biopsy findings of monomorphic, intermediate-size, mature B cells that have translocation of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8 on genetic testing are pathognomonic for Burkitt lymphoma. Various aggressive multiagent chemotherapy regimens with rituximab have been associated with high cure rates. This patient presents with the classic clinical and biopsy findings of Burkitt lymphoma, and it would be most appropriate to test for Epstein-Barr infection.Adenovirus (Option A) is not associated with lymphomas but may be a complication for patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to obtain adenovirus PCR testing in this patient.Hepatitis C virus (Option C) is associated with splenic marginal zone lymphoma. When this type of lymphoma is diagnosed in patients with hepatitis C, targeting this infection with antiviral agents is recommended. This patient has endemic Burkitt lymphoma, not splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Therefore, hepatitis C virus PCR testing would not be the most appropriate test to perform in this patient.Human herpesvirus 8 (Option D) has been associated with Kaposi sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma in patients with HIV infection. This patient does not have Kaposi sarcoma or primary effusion lymphoma, so human herpesvirus 8 PCR would not be the most appropriate test to perform next.",
