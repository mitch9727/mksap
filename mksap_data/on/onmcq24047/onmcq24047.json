  "question_text": "A 61-year-old man is evaluated for abdominal pain radiating to his back. The patient otherwise feels well. He has a family history of ovarian cancer in his sister and prostate cancer in his father. He has no other medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The liver edge is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin.Laboratory studies:Complete blood countNormalCreatinineNormalTotal bilirubinNormalContrast-enhanced CT scan shows a 5-cm mass in the body of the pancreas and multiple hypodense liver lesions consistent with metastases. CT-guided percutaneous biopsy specimen from a liver lesion reveals adenocarcinoma consistent with pancreaticobiliary origin.",

  "critique": "This patient should receive germline testing for BRCA pathogenic variants (Option A). Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer will be found to have a heritable cancer predisposition variant, the most common of which is a BRCA variant. All patients with pancreatic cancer are now recommended to undergo germline testing for BRCA, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, and microsatellite instability (Lynch syndrome). A family history of first-degree relatives with ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, such as in this patient, increases the likelihood of a heritable predisposition variant. In addition, the presence of a BRCA variant would offer the additional therapeutic option of treatment with a poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. The presence of a heritable variant would have important implications for the patient and his family, and testing should be completed.Whole-body PET/CT (Option B) is not the most appropriate next test for this patient. PET/CT is not part of the routine management for pancreatic cancer and, with liver metastases clearly identified, would not be expected to add any clinically useful information.Testing for CA 19-9 (Option C) is not indicated for this patient. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker used as a means of surveillance in patients with resected pancreatic cancer or to indicate response or progression in metastatic disease. It has a limited role in the initial diagnostic evaluation of possible pancreatic cancer, especially in a patient with easily evaluated liver metastases on CT.This patient does not require testing for PD-1 and PD-L1 (Option D). PD-1 and PD-L1 are potential markers for efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, these markers are not relevant in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. With the rare exception (<1%) of patients who have mismatch repair–deficient cancer, currently available immune checkpoint inhibitors are not active in pancreatic cancer.",
