  "question_text": "A 68-year-old man is evaluated before starting treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma. He has a good performance status and no contraindications to chemotherapy but is worried about the negative effect chemotherapy might have on his quality of life. He has read a study regarding the chemotherapy regimen that has been recommended for him, which concluded that the three-drug regimen was found to offer a highly statistically significant benefit in terms of overall survival. However, the three-drug regimen also resulted in more nausea, vomiting, skin rash, and fatigue than a two-drug regimen. The patient has no other medical problems and takes no medications.",

  "critique": "The survival difference reported in this study is unlikely to be due to chance (Option D). Patients and clinicians often conflate the terms significant and substantial. The term significant is objective when used to describe statistical significance. The statistical significance of a finding refers to the degree of certainty that the difference is real and not due to random chance. The phrase statistically significant, however, is often misinterpreted to denote clinical significance. It is used in an unqualified manner, such as a report of “a significant improvement in survival,” which refers to the statistical significance of the finding. Statistical significance, however, does not indicate that there is a clinically significant difference. An improvement in survival of 1 week, for example, may be statistically significant but not necessarily clinically significant.It would be incorrect to assume that patients who received the three-drug regimen had a greater chance of cure (Option A). An improvement in overall survival does not necessarily mean that any of the patients were cured, or that there was a difference in cure between the treatment arms.Similarly, it cannot be assumed that patients who received the three-drug regimen had a greater chance of relief of tumor-related symptoms (Option B). The study reported a difference in overall survival but did not report the impact of the treatment on specific tumor-related symptoms.There is not enough information to state that the survival difference reported in this study is large (Option C). A finding reported as statistically significant is unlikely to have resulted from random chance, and one that is “highly statistically significant” is very unlikely to have resulted from random chance. However, the absolute difference in outcomes could still be quite small, especially if the study population is large. Thus, a statement that a finding is highly significant assures the certainty of the finding but does not provide information about the magnitude of the difference.",
