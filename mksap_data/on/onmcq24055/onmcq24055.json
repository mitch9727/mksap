  "question_text": "A 45-year-old woman is evaluated after screening mammography revealed a 2-cm × 3-cm spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Biopsy revealed invasive estrogen receptor–negative, progesterone receptor–negative, HER2-positive ductal carcinoma. She has no other medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. A palpable 2.5-cm × 3-cm mass is noted in the right breast. There are no palpable axillary lymph nodes.Results of laboratory studies are normal.Axillary ultrasound shows no suspicious lymph nodes.",

  "critique": "This patient should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with HER2-directed therapy (Option B). Approximately 15% to 20% of all breast cancers overexpress HER2 receptors. These tumors had historically been associated with poor prognosis; however, with the development of HER2-directed therapies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, patient outcomes have improved dramatically. In the adjuvant setting, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy decreases the risk for cancer recurrence by 53% and the risk for death by 34%. For patients with tumors larger than 2 cm or with positive lymph nodes, neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab is the standard of care. Patients with no residual disease at the time of surgery have an excellent prognosis and often complete a year of treatment with trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab. Patients with residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy have a greater recurrence risk, and adjuvant HER2-directed therapy can reduce recurrence. Neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab is indicated in this patient with a HER2-positive tumor greater than 2 cm.Neither neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (Option A) nor neoadjuvant HER2-directed therapy alone (Option C) would be an appropriate approach for this patient. Patients with HER2-positive tumors larger than 2 cm or with positive lymph nodes should undergo neoadjuvant therapy with the combination of chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy. Neoadjuvant treatment with either HER2-directed therapy or chemotherapy alone would be inadequate treatment for this patient.Surgery (Option D) without neoadjuvant therapy is not the best approach for this patient. Neoadjuvant therapy is standard of care for those with HER2-positive breast tumors 2 cm or larger or with lymph node involvement. Following neoadjuvant therapy, patients with no residual disease at the time of surgery have an excellent prognosis and often complete a year of adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab. Patients with residual disease after preoperative therapy have a greater recurrence risk, and adjuvant HER2-directed therapy is also used in this setting.",
