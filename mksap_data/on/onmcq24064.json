He also reports a 4-week history of progressive low back pain. The patient has metastatic prostate cancer with bone involvement, for which he is being treated with leuprolide and abiraterone.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Saddle paresthesia is present along with increased reflexes and decreased strength in the lower extremities bilaterally.Treatment is initiated with high-dose intravenous dexamethasone.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management would be immediate MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines (Option C). Neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) develops in approximately 2.5% of patients with metastatic cancer. The most common types of cancer that cause ESCC in adults are lung, breast, and prostate cancers; myeloma; and lymphoma. Pain, often radicular and worse with recumbency, is present in more than 80% of patients and usually precedes neurologic symptoms by several weeks. Neurologic symptoms include weakness, sensory loss, and bowel or bladder dysfunction (retention or incontinence). This diagnosis should be considered in all patients, particularly those with a history of cancer, who present with these symptoms. The absence of neurologic signs should not delay evaluation, and early recognition is critical to maintain neurologic function. When ESCC is suspected, high-dose intravenous dexamethasone should be started immediately, followed by urgent MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines. This patient has a known history of prostate cancer with bone metastases, and his presentation suggests malignancy-related spinal cord compression; urgent MRI of the entire thecal sac should be performed.A bone scan (Option A) should not be obtained at this time. Bone scans are helpful in defining the extent of bony metastatic disease in prostate cancer and can be used to monitor disease progression and treatment response. Bone scans can confirm the presence of vertebral metastatic disease. However, they do not allow for diagnosis of ESCC and are not useful in this clinical situation.Measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (Option B) is not the next most appropriate step in the management of this patient. Although a PSA level can help determine response to therapy and provide evidence of recurrent disease, it is not otherwise helpful in the diagnosis of ESCC.This patient should not undergo lumbar MRI alone (Option D). Based on the clinical findings of saddle paresthesia and lower extremity weakness, the patient likely has ESCC in the lumbar region. However, MRI of this region alone may miss other concomitant lesions that could be contributing to the neurologic dysfunction. Additionally, a sensory level, if present, is typically one to five levels below the actual level of cord compression. MRI of the entire thecal sac is the test of choice to assess the possibility of ESCC.PET/CT (Option E) is not indicated because the optimal imaging modality to assess for ESCC is MRI. ESCC is an emergency, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to preserve neurologic function. Depending on the setting, PET/CT can be considered after the evaluation and treatment of ESCC.",
