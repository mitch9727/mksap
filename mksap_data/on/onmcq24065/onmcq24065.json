  "question_text": "A 53-year-old woman is evaluated in the emergency department for 3-week history of progressive dyspnea, central chest pain, and bilateral lower extremity edema that is now limiting her activities of daily living. She has metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, for which she has been treated with daunorubicin and is now receiving paclitaxel.On physical examination, temperature is 37.8 °C (100.1 °F), blood pressure is 90/70 mm Hg, pulse rate is 110/min, and respiration rate is 19/min. Oxygen saturation is 98% with the patient breathing ambient air. Inspiration leads to a fall in systolic blood pressure of 15 mm Hg. Jugular venous distention is noted. Cardiac examination reveals a regular rhythm and tachycardia. The patient has 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.Results of laboratory studies are normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate management for this patient is transthoracic echocardiography (Option D) to assess for cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is secondary to malignancy in 13% to 23% of cases. Malignancy-associated cardiac tamponade is often subacute (developing over days to weeks) because the effusions accumulate slowly. Patients may initially be asymptomatic and then develop symptoms, such as dyspnea, chest discomfort, and fatigue with further fluid accumulation. Symptoms from malignancy-associated cardiac tamponade may be inappropriately attributed to nonspecific systemic signs of cancer or heart failure, and a high index of suspicion is key to early diagnosis. The initial test of choice in suspected cardiac tamponade is echocardiography, which can demonstrate the presence of a pericardial effusion and changes suggesting a hemodynamic impact of the effusion, such as right atrial and ventricular collapse. This patient has known metastatic cancer, and her symptoms and findings on examination, including elevated jugular venous pressure and a fall in blood pressure with inspiration, are concerning for malignancy-associated cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography is the most appropriate next test to perform.Obtaining CT angiography of the chest (Option A) would not be the most appropriate management. CT angiography would be the preferred test for suspected pulmonary embolism but provides little data on possible tamponade other than the presence and size of a pericardial effusion. Echocardiography is the preferred option.Furosemide (Option B) is contraindicated because of the possibility of cardiac tamponade. Although patients with tamponade often have jugular venous distension, diuretic therapy decreases preload, which can result in hemodynamic collapse in patients with tamponade. Furosemide would be appropriate if heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is seen on echocardiography, but the possibility of cardiac tamponade needs to be addressed before diuretics are given.Checking an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level (Option C) is not indicated for this patient. She is at risk for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction because of previous treatment with daunorubicin, but the clinical findings are more consistent with cardiac tamponade, and this possibility must be addressed urgently with echocardiography.",
