  "question_text": "A 55-year-old man is hospitalized for a 6-month history of progressive shortness of breath, weakness, cough, and an 18.1-kg (40.0 lb) weight loss. He is too weak to do any household chores.On physical examination, the patient is cachectic and frail. BMI is 20. Oxygen saturation is 93% with the patient breathing 2 L/min of oxygen through nasal cannula. Breath sounds are normal. Palpation reveals hepatomegaly.Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status is 3. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows a large right upper lung mass with associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, multiple osseous metastatic lesions, and multiple hepatic lesions. Liver biopsy results confirm metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Tumor genomic profiling reveals no driver alteration.",

  "critique": "Patients with a poor performance status owing to lung cancer with no driver alteration and those with irreversible end-organ damage are unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy or immunotherapy; these patients should be considered for hospice care (Option B). This patient has advanced metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with several months of symptoms before hospitalization and very poor performance status. In such patients, the most appropriate intervention is hospice care consultation. Additionally, goals of care should be discussed, as well as the low likelihood of efficacy associated with systemic treatment.Ablation of liver metastases (Option A) plays no role in the management of patients with NSCLC and poor performance status, particularly in the setting of extensive extrahepatic cancer, such as in this patient.Platinum-based chemoimmunotherapy (Option C) is associated with significant potential toxicity in patients with poor performance status and is not recommended. Patients with poor performance status due to lung cancer that has a treatment-naïve driver alteration should be considered for urgent initiation of targeted therapy.Considering the presence of obvious extensive metastatic disease, radiation treatment (Option D) would be recommended only for palliation. However, this patient is experiencing systemic effects from his cancer and does not have any specific lesion needing local palliation.",
