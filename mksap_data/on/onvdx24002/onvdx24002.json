  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is lung cancer (Option B). PET/CT is a standard component of initial staging for all patients with non–small cell lung cancer and is useful for assessing mediastinal nodes and identifying distant metastatic disease. This patient's PET/CT scan shows enhanced uptake of the 18-fluorodeoxyglucose marker (seen as red on the image), indicating increased metabolic activity consistent with high likelihood of malignancy. Abnormal 18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake is not seen elsewhere on the scan. Resection of this lesion showed an adenocarcinoma with no evidence of spread to hilar or mediastinal nodes.",
