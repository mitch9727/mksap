Mycosis fungoides has various presentations; the most common presentation consists of persistent and/or progressive large, often pruritic, scaly patches or plaques that vary in size, shape, and color. Lesions occur on both sun-exposed and sun-protected skin. Diagnosis is made by skin biopsy. In contrast, Sweet syndrome, which can occur in the setting of hematologic malignancies, appears as painful, red-to-violaceous “juicy” papules and plaques, most commonly in the facial area and on the extremities.",
