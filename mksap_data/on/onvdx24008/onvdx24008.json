Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is manifest as flattening of the normal angle between the base of the nail and the cuticle and swelling of the distal digit. Also known as clubbing, it can occur in lung cancer as well as in other pulmonary conditions, such as bronchiectasis, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and tuberculosis. It can also be seen in nonpulmonary disorders, including congenital heart disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This patient with clubbing, cough, and hemoptysis most likely has lung cancer.",
