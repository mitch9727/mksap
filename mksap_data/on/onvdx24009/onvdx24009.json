The key to diagnosis of CLL is recognition of an increased blood leukocyte count resulting from increased numbers of mature lymphocytes and “smudge cells” on peripheral blood smear. Smudge cells, as demonstrated in this image (upper left of center and bottom left of center) are caused by mature-appearing peripheral lymphocytes that are abnormally fragile and become damaged during slide preparation.",
