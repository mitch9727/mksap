  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is Hodgkin lymphoma (Option B). Hodgkin lymphoma represents approximately 10% of lymphomas. The nodular sclerosing subtype is most common and frequently presents with enlarged mediastinal, cervical, and/or supraclavicular nodes. Patients may also have B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), although these are most commonly seen in older patients with more advanced disease. The diagnosis is established with a lymph node biopsy specimen showing Reed-Sternberg cells, malignant cells that originate from germinal center B cells and are seen in an inflammatory infiltrate. This patient has an anterior mediastinal mass (arrows) consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.",
