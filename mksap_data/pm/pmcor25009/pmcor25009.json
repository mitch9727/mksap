  "question_text": "A 51-year-old man is evaluated for a 3-month history of worsening lower-extremity edema. He reports no chest pain, dyspnea, or cough. He has obesity and a 15-pack-year smoking history. He has no known medical problems and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. BMI is 42. Breath sounds are diminished at the bases. No adventitial sounds are heard. Heart sounds are normal. Moderate jugular venous distention and bilateral pitting edema of the legs are noted.Laboratory studies:Hematocrit51%Hemoglobin17 g/dL (170 g/L)B-type natriuretic peptide90 pg/mL (90 ng/L)Creatinine0.9 mg/dL (79.6 µmol/L)ElectrolytesSodium139 mEq/L (139 mmol/L)Potassium4.1 mEq/L (4.1 mmol/L)Chloride100 mEq/L (100 mmol/L)Bicarbonate30 mEq/L (30 mmol/L)HArterial blood gasespH7.36LPco253 mm Hg (7.0 kPa)HPo252 mm Hg (6.9 kPa)LUrinalysis findings are within normal limits.Chest radiograph shows reduced lung volumes.",

  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient with elevated BMI, daytime hypercapnia, and evidence of right heart failure is obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) (Option C). OHS is characterized by daytime hypercapnia (arterial Pco2 >45 mm Hg [6.0 kPa]) that is thought to be a consequence of diminished ventilatory drive and capacity related to extreme obesity. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is usually but not always superimposed. Biventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and volume overload are common. An elevated serum bicarbonate level and erythrocytosis may be clues to the diagnosis. Weight loss is the cornerstone of management of OHS, and bariatric surgery can be considered. Additionally, positive airway pressure therapy is indicated for patients with OHS. No definitive trials have compared continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). However, the most recent guideline recommends CPAP as initial therapy for overlapping OSA and obesity hypoventilation, although BPAP might be warranted for patients without coexisting OSA. Supplemental oxygen may need to be added. This patient's elevated BMI puts him at risk for OHS, and his daytime hypercapnia, in the absence of other apparent causes of hypoventilation, confirms the diagnosis.Central sleep apnea (CSA) (Option A) is defined by intermittent reduced central drive to breathe due to loss of output from central respiratory generators in the brainstem and is not a hypoventilation syndrome. In CSA, the response to arterial Pco2 is exaggerated, resulting in ventilatory overshoot, hyperventilation, and reduction of the arterial Pco2 to a level at which respiratory efforts cease. As a result, patients with CSA are generally normocapnic or slightly hypocapnic on blood gas testing. Because this patient is experiencing daytime hypercapnia, CSA is not the most likely diagnosis.Long-standing, severe COPD (Option B) may lead to carbon dioxide retention and hypercapnia. However, despite this patient's smoking history, he lacks other clinical findings consistent with a diagnosis of COPD, such as dyspnea, cough, sputum production, or hyperinflation on chest radiograph.Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (Option D) is defined by sleep interruption resulting from repetitive upper airway narrowing or collapse. OSA often coexists with OHS, and polysomnography is required to determine the extent of OSA and to titrate positive airway pressure therapy. However, OSA alone cannot account for this patient's daytime hypercapnia.",
