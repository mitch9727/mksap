  "question_text": "A 44-year-old woman is evaluated for follow-up of pulmonary embolism diagnosed 4 months ago. She continues to have dyspnea on exertion and lightheadedness with walking up more than one flight of stairs. Her only medication is apixaban.On physical examination, pulse rate is 100/min; other vital signs are normal. Jugular venous distention is present. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia and splitting of the S2 heart sound. Lung sounds are clear. No lower extremity edema is noted.Echocardiogram shows right ventricular dilation with reduced function. Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 54 mm Hg. Left ventricular function is normal. Ventilation-perfusion scan shows multiple mismatched defects. Chest CT scan demonstrates rapid tapering of several lobar arteries with chronic thrombi in the right upper lobe and webbing within distal branches of the right lower lobe and lingula.Right heart catheterization confirms precapillary pulmonary hypertension.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient with newly diagnosed chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is to refer her for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) (Option D). In CTEPH, chronic thrombi within the pulmonary arteries result in physical obstruction of the pulmonary arterial tree along with abnormal pulmonary angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. When significant, the resultant pulmonary hypertension causes right-sided heart failure and increased mortality. Although all patients with CTEPH should receive lifelong systemic anticoagulation, PTE is the only potential curative therapy, with about half of patients being eligible for surgery. PTE normalizes pulmonary hemodynamics and improves functional capacity in about one-third of patients undergoing surgery. Patients with newly diagnosed CTEPH should be referred for evaluation of PTE candidacy by a multidisciplinary expert team. In patients who are deemed inoperable by one expert center, referral for a second opinion is recommended. This patient's presentation is consistent with CTEPH, with right-sided heart dysfunction, precapillary pulmonary hypertension, and chronic thrombi and rapid tapering of pulmonary vasculature on CT angiogram. She should be referred for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.Lifelong anticoagulation is indicated in CTEPH to prevent recurrent thromboembolism. Factor Xa inhibitors, such as apixaban, are the preferred option in venous thromboembolic disease, and there is no reason to switch to warfarin (Option A). In addition, anticoagulation alone does not address the pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction of CTEPH, and this patient requires an evaluation for PTE.Patients with nonoperative, persistent, or recurrent CTEPH following PTE may benefit from pulmonary vasodilator therapy, but this patient should be evaluated for surgery before consideration of vasodilator therapy. In addition, although bosentan (Option B) has a role in the initial treatment of mild to moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, riociguat decreases pulmonary vascular resistance and improves functional capacity in CTEPH and is the preferred vasodilator option in patients with nonoperative, persistent, or recurrent CTEPH following PTE.Similarly, in patients with nonoperative, persistent, or recurrent CTEPH, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (Option C) may provide hemodynamic and functional benefits when given along with pulmonary vasodilators. It, however, should not be offered before surgical evaluation by a multidisciplinary CTEPH team.",
