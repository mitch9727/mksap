  "question_text": "A 71-year-old man is evaluated for left-sided chest discomfort and worsening dyspnea. He had a similar presentation 1 month ago, when a left pleural effusion was noted and thoracentesis removed 1 L of bloody fluid; pleural fluid analysis showed an exudative effusion with negative cultures and cytology findings. He reports no fever, night sweats, weight loss, lower extremity edema, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient has a 20-pack-year smoking history and quit smoking 50 years ago. He worked as an automotive mechanic for 40 years.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. No jugular venous distention is present. Lung auscultation reveals dullness to percussion over the left lower hemithorax and decreased breath sounds over the left lower lung; the right lung is clear. Heart sounds are normal, and no lower extremity edema is noted.Chest radiograph is shown.Thoracentesis is again performed, with removal of 1200 mL of fluid. Analysis demonstrates an exudative effusion; cytology and culture findings are again negative.CT scan of the chest reveals no lung masses or abnormal lymphadenopathy. Pleural thickening is noted on the left side.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with a recurrent exudative pleural effusion and likely asbestos exposure is thoracoscopic pleural biopsy (Option D). Malignant pleural mesothelioma should be suspected in the setting of recurrent exudative pleural effusion and a history of asbestos exposure. In patients with possible malignant pleural effusion, the overall sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology for malignancy is 60% but varies depending on the type of cancer. Pleural cytology sensitivity for mesothelioma is low (29%), and invasive diagnostic testing is often necessary. Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy has a greater than 90% sensitivity for diagnosing pleural malignancy and should be pursued when pleural fluid cytology is unrevealing. This patient has a recurrent exudative pleural effusion, pleural thickening on CT scan, and a history of possible asbestos exposure as an automotive mechanic, raising concern for mesothelioma. Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.Echocardiography (Option A) is not an appropriate test in this patient. Although heart failure is a common cause of recurrent pleural effusion, the fluid is typically transudative. This patient also does not have findings on history or examination suggestive of heart failure.Flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy (Option B) is not indicated in this patient. It is an appropriate procedure for obtaining tissue from mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in the diagnosis and staging of patients with known or suspected thoracic malignancy but is not helpful in the diagnosis of pleural disease and possible mesothelioma.Measurement of the pleural fluid triglyceride level (Option C) is helpful in the diagnosis of chylothorax. Chylothorax is secondary to lymphatic obstruction or disruption and typically has a milky appearance. Although chylothorax is a cause of recurrent exudative effusion, the appearance of the fluid (bloody) and clinical history in this patient are not consistent with this diagnosis.",
