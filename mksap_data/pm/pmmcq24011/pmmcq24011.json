  "question_text": "A 28-year-old man is evaluated for a 4-month history of shortness of breath. It has progressed since onset, and he now notes dyspnea with walking up stairs. He has had no chest pain, cough, or orthopnea but has noticed occasional lower extremity edema at the end of the day. He does not smoke tobacco. His mother has pulmonary hypertension attributable to a variation in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2. He has no medical history and takes no medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. No jugular venous distention or hepatojugular reflux is present. Cardiac examination reveals an accentuated pulmonic closure sound and a soft systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Lung sounds are normal. No lower extremity edema is noted.Chest radiograph is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient suspected of having pulmonary hypertension (PH) is transthoracic echocardiography (Option C). The diagnostic approach to PH begins with assessment of a patient's clinical symptoms and physical examination. When PH is suspected, current guidelines recommend transthoracic echocardiography, which is inexpensive, noninvasive, and able to assess several parameters related to right ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressure. Although no single parameter is highly specific, echocardiography also allows determination of an estimate of whether the patient has a high, intermediate, or low likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). If suspicion for PAH is intermediate or high, a pulmonary artery catheterization is indicated to confirm the diagnosis. Testing for other causes of PH, including chronic lung disease, left heart disease, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, may also be indicated depending on the clinical scenario. This patient has a family history of PAH, symptoms consistent with PH, and an accentuated pulmonic closure sound; he should be evaluated with transthoracic echocardiography.Up to 10% of patients with PAH have heritable forms of the disease. An autosomal dominant variation in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) is most common, although penetrance is variable and as low as 20% in men. Once PAH is diagnosed, genetic testing (Option A) is important to identify the cause, but a positive BMPR2 result would not confirm that this patient's symptoms are a result of PAH, especially given the variable penetrance. Transthoracic echocardiography followed by pulmonary artery catheterization is necessary to diagnose PAH before genetic testing is done.Although right heart catheterization (Option B) is indicated in patients suspected of having PAH, it is invasive and should not precede echocardiography as a first-line test. If the echocardiogram suggests an intermediate or high risk for PAH, further evaluation with right heart catheterization would be appropriate, but echocardiography is the best first test.Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning (Option D) is indicated in patients with PH, but it is not a first-line test. Only if the echocardiogram suggests PH should V/Q scanning be considered to rule out chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.",
