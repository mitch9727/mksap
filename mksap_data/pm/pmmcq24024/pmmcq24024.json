  "question_text": "A 66-year-old patient is evaluated in the emergency department for sudden-onset dyspnea and left-sided pleuritic chest pain that developed at rest. The symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 6 hours. The patient has a 70-pack-year history of tobacco use and continues to smoke two packs per day. They have hypertension, dyslipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, simvastatin, metoprolol, and apixaban.On physical examination, temperature is 37.2 °C (99.0 °F), blood pressure is 160/84 mm Hg, pulse rate is 95/min, and respiration rate is 20/min. Oxygen saturation is 90% with the patient breathing ambient air. Pulmonary examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side with hyperresonance to percussion and absent tactile fremitus.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with a likely pneumothorax is chest radiography (Option C). Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or result from trauma or a procedure. A primary pneumothorax occurs in someone without known underlying lung disease. A secondary pneumothorax occurs in someone with an established lung disease, such as COPD. Symptoms include sudden onset of dyspnea and sharp pleuritic chest pain and are typically more severe with secondary pneumothorax because patients have less respiratory reserve. Prompt recognition of the signs and symptoms of a pneumothorax is important to prevent patient deterioration. When pneumothorax is suspected, patients who are stable from a respiratory and hemodynamic standpoint should undergo bedside upright chest radiography as the first test of choice. The radiograph will also quantify the size of the pneumothorax, which will help to direct treatment. This stable patient has a likely pneumothorax that is probably from undiagnosed COPD, and they should undergo chest radiography.Arterial blood gas studies (Option A) are indicated when it is necessary to assess acid-base status or partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, such as in suspected ventilatory failure. In this case, arterial blood gas studies will likely demonstrate hypoxemia but will not help differentiate the cause of the symptoms and are not necessary.Bedside chest ultrasonography (Option B) is commonly used for suspected pneumothorax when patients are unstable and concern is present for tension physiology. In such patients, absence of lung slide and/or a lung point helps to diagnose a pneumothorax. Although chest ultrasonography is very sensitive, a lung point is not always present and other conditions can cause the lack of lung slide on ultrasound. Therefore, for stable patients, chest radiography is the diagnostic modality of choice over ultrasonography.CT of the chest (Option D) is the most accurate modality to diagnose a pneumothorax because it can easily distinguish between bullae and pleural gas. It should be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty but is not the best first step. In addition, although CT is a preferred test for many patients with possible pulmonary embolism, this patient is unlikely to have a pulmonary embolism because they are anticoagulated, and a pulmonary embolism would not explain the findings seen on pulmonary examination.",
