He reports no chest pain or shortness of breath. He has a 50-pack-year history of smoking and stopped smoking 4 years ago. He has a history of COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 2/group B). Medications are inhaled fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanterol.Physical examination findings, including vital signs, are normal except for lung auscultation showing uniformly decreased breath sounds and a prolonged expiratory phase.CT scan revealing a 5-cm mass is shown.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in management of this patient with a spiculated lung mass is PET/CT (Option A). PET/CT uses the radionuclide fluorodeoxyglucose, which accumulates within highly metabolically active cells, such as cancer cells, and can be visualized as discrete areas of uptake. PET/CT is widely used to evaluate the likelihood of malignancy in lung nodules, to stage lung cancer, and to evaluate for metastatic disease from other nonthoracic malignancies. PET/CT often identifies unsuspected mediastinal or metastatic disease in lung cancer, which informs staging and reduces the number of noncurative surgeries performed. Similarly, in patients with radiographic evidence of advanced-stage disease for whom diagnosis and staging are best accomplished with a single invasive test, PET/CT can help determine the best location for biopsy. This patient's presentation of recurrent hemoptysis with a sizable lung mass on imaging is highly concerning for lung cancer. PET/CT would help both to determine the best location for biopsy and to stage the cancer if present.The risk for cancer in this patient with a history of tobacco use and a large lung mass is high. Limiting evaluation to follow-up imaging with repeat CT in 3 months (Option B) without performing additional testing to diagnose and stage the suspected cancer would result in unnecessary delays in diagnosis and potential treatment.In patients who have peripheral lung nodules (<3 cm) with high risk for cancer, surgical referral for resection (Option C) is often warranted. Factors that favor proceeding directly to surgical resection include a low risk for N2 or N3 disease based on previously performed comprehensive PET/CT. This patient has a lung mass greater than 3 cm and is therefore at higher risk for occult metastatic disease. This would warrant additional evaluation to look for metastatic disease before surgery.Sputum cytology (Option D) has poor sensitivity for the detection of lung cancer and is infrequently used, although it may have a role in patients who are not candidates for biopsy or other diagnostic testing. Sputum cytology would not be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient who, although chronically ill, is able to undergo other means of testing.",
