  "critique": "The most appropriate next diagnostic step in this patient with possible tuberculous pleuritis is pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (ADA) testing (Option B). Pleural effusion from tuberculosis can be due to primary infection or, more commonly, reactivation disease. Pleural fluid typically is exudative, with a predominance of lymphocytes on cell count. Diagnosis is challenging because acid-fast smear and culture are often negative. ADA is an enzyme present in lymphocytes that is elevated in most tuberculous pleural effusions (sensitivity, 90%). In geographic areas with low prevalence, pleural fluid ADA has a high negative predictive value (98.9%) for excluding tuberculosis. In areas of high prevalence, a high pleural fluid ADA level (>40 U/L) carries a positive predictive value of 98%. False-positive results can occur because pleural fluid ADA level is sometimes elevated in other disorders, such as malignancy, bacterial empyema, and parapneumonic effusions. This patient has a unilateral lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion and was born in a country with a high prevalence of tuberculous. Determining the pleural fluid ADA level is an important next step in assessing for tuberculosis as the cause of the pleural effusion.If the pleural fluid ADA is high and smear and culture for acid-fast bacilli are negative, pleural biopsy (Option A) is a reasonable next diagnostic step. Biopsy yields a positive mycobacterial culture in more than 70% of tuberculous effusions; histology may also establish the diagnosis if caseating granulomas are seen. Given its more invasive nature, however, biopsy is a second-line procedure for this patient.A pleural fluid triglyceride level above 110 mg/dL (1.24 mmol/L) suggests chylothorax. A chylothorax usually results from a disruption of the thoracic duct secondary to thoracic surgery or trauma or, less frequently, from malignancy and lymphatic malformations. None of these is a likely diagnosis in this patient, and pleural fluid triglyceride level measurement (Option C) is not the best next test.Transthoracic echocardiography (Option D) is a useful test when heart failure is the suspected cause of a pleural effusion. Effusions from heart failure are due to increased hydrostatic pressure and are usually transudates. This patient has an exudative effusion (), and heart failure is not a likely cause of the effusion; transthoracic echocardiography is not indicated.",
