  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient is a long-acting bronchodilator such as tiotropium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (Option A). Appropriate treatment of COPD requires frequent reassessment of disease severity. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) combined assessment () stratifies patients into categories A, B, and E based on symptom severity and history of exacerbations. The GOLD patient category that is determined then directs the appropriate pharmacologic therapy (). For patients in group A, which is characterized by mild symptoms and one or fewer exacerbations not requiring hospitalization per year, appropriate therapy includes a short- or long-acting bronchodilator. A long-acting agent is generally preferred, although patients with very mild or infrequent symptoms can be managed with as-needed use of a short-acting agent. Both long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and LAMAs are appropriate choices in this patient group. This patient with mild symptoms ( and ) is in group A and has insufficient symptom control with a short-acting bronchodilator. Prescribing a long-acting bronchodilator, such as tiotropium, is the most appropriate next step.Although GOLD severity groups A and B both indicate low risk, patients in group B demonstrate a greater symptom burden; therefore, combination LABA and LAMA therapy, such as umeclidinium-vilanterol (Option B), is recommended. This patient, however, has only mild symptoms with dyspnea walking uphill and is in group A. Monotherapy with an inhaled LABA or LAMA is the appropriate choice.Patients with two or more exacerbations or one or more exacerbations leading to hospitalization per year are categorized as group E regardless of symptom severity and should receive combination LAMA and LABA therapy. Triple therapy with a LABA; a LAMA; and an inhaled glucocorticoid, such as inhaled umeclidinium-vilanterol-fluticasone (Option C), may be considered if blood eosinophil count is 300/μL (0.30 × 109/L) or higher. This approach would not be the best next step in treatment for this patient with group A COPD.Short-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol, are appropriate in COPD as a rescue inhaler and for use in patients with mild and infrequent symptoms. However, most patients with COPD require controller therapy rather than as-needed albuterol. This patient, however, has had progression of symptoms and should begin receiving a long-acting bronchodilator rather than continuing as-needed albuterol alone (Option D).",

  "question_text": "A 64-year-old woman is evaluated for shortness of breath. She has a history of COPD (FEV1 68% of predicted), which is treated with albuterol on an as-needed basis. Although she previously had infrequent symptoms, over the past 6 months she has had consistent dyspnea while walking uphill but can walk on a level surface without dyspnea. She now uses the albuterol inhaler several times per week. She has never had an exacerbation of COPD. She has a 45-pack-year history of tobacco use and quit smoking 4 years ago. She has no other medical history and takes no other medications.On physical examination, vital signs and oxygen saturation are normal. Scattered expiratory wheezing is noted on lung auscultation.",
