Pulmonary manifestations often include chronic productive cough, recurrent sinusitis, and recurrent pulmonary infections requiring recurrent courses of antibiotics. This chest radiograph demonstrates findings consistent with a diagnosis of CF. There are diffusely thickened bronchial walls (arrows) and pairs of parallel linear opacities (“tram tracks”) (arrowheads), consistent with bronchiectasis. Also seen are diffusely distributed patchy areas of airspace consolidation as well as mild hyperinflation of the chest.",
