The scan is at a level just below the carina. It shows marked enlargement of lymph nodes in both hila (white arrows) and enlargement of a subcarinal lymph node (black arrow). Stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis is generally asymptomatic. Approximately 50% of all patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis are asymptomatic, with the disease incidentally detected on chest imaging performed for unrelated indications. (AAo = ascending aorta; DAo = descending aorta; LMB = left mainstem bronchus; RMB = right mainstem bronchus; RPA = right pulmonary artery.)",
