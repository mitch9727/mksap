The 3-cm nodular lesion seen at the base of the right lung is smooth, sharply circumscribed, and homogeneous in density; it is not associated with notable hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Nodular lung lesions are often caused by bronchogenic carcinoma or metastatic cancer. However, given this patient's age and nonsmoking status, a congenital or developmental lesion, such as an arteriovenous malformation, is more likely. In this case, a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest demonstrated the presence of an arteriovenous malformation.",
