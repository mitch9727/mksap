Bullae, which are most commonly caused by cigarette use, appear as hyperlucent areas on CT and are sharply demarcated from surrounding lung by a thin wall. In this case, the bullae have caused compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe and a leftward shift of the mediastinum. Bullae may represent severe localized disease or be associated with widespread emphysema. Bullectomy may be a treatment option for patients with localized disease.",
