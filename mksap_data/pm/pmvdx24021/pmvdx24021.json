  "critique": "This patient's chest CT scan demonstrates bullous lung disease (Option A). Bullae, which are most commonly caused by cigarette use, appear as hyperlucent areas on CT and are sharply demarcated from surrounding lung by a thin wall. In this case, the bullae have caused compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe and a leftward shift of the mediastinum. Bullae may represent severe localized disease or be associated with widespread emphysema. Bullectomy may be a treatment option for patients with localized disease.",
