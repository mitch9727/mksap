  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is radiation pneumonitis (Option C), which typically occurs 4 to 12 weeks after initial radiation exposure. High-resolution CT in radiation pneumonitis will demonstrate ground-glass opacities, usually within the field of radiation exposure. A well-defined nonanatomic demarcation between normal and abnormal lung consistent with the radiation field is pathognomonic but not always present. This patient's chest CT scan shows a nonanatomic straight-line demarcation between involved and noninvolved lung parenchyma (red arrows). Patients with radiation pneumonitis present with cough, shortness of breath, and a new radiographic infiltrate. Fever, pleuritic chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss are accompanying nonspecific symptoms. Differential diagnosis often includes infection and drug-induced lung injury.",
