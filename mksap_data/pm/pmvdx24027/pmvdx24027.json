  "critique": "This ultrasound video shows findings consistent with pulmonary edema (Option C). It demonstrates vertical hyperechoic lines extending downward from the pleural line, similar to lasers or searchlights, known as B lines.Analogous to Kerley B lines on a chest radiograph, a diffuse B-line pattern suggests interstitial thickening, most often caused by fluid or pulmonary edema. This ultrasound also depicts a hyperechoic (bright white) horizontal line in the near field moving with respiration (“lung sliding”), which is a normal finding. Lung sliding and a B-line pattern throughout exclude pneumothorax. Similarly, a pleural effusion most often appears as an anechoic (black) region in dependent areas cephalad to the diaphragm.",
