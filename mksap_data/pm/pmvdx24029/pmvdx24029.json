  "critique": "These chest radiographic findings are consistent with an obstructive lung disease, such as COPD (Option C). The frontal chest radiograph shows hyperinflation with increased lucency and decreased vascularity throughout both lung fields. The lateral chest radiograph demonstrates flattening of the diaphragm and an increased retrosternal air space. However, COPD is a clinical rather than radiographic diagnosis, and an appropriate history and pulmonary function test results are required to establish the diagnosis.",
