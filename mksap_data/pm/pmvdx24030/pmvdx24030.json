  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is a solitary pulmonary nodule (Option D). This image from contrast-enhanced CT of the chest reveals a well-circumscribed nodule within the left upper lobe. Nodules are less than or equal to 30 mm in size, whereas masses are greater than 30 mm. Differentiating an enhancing nodule from a vessel may be difficult without the use of multiple contiguous images. Vessels, however, become progressively smaller in diameter with distance from the hilum, whereas the contrast-enhanced finding shown is clearly larger than vessels much closer to the hilum. No other discrete nodular infiltrates are noted on this image, making aspergilloma and pneumonia unlikely.",
