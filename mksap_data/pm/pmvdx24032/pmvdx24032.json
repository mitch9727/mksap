An edge demarcating the abrupt end of parenchymal lung tissue (white arrowheads) is seen. The air-filled pneumothorax is lateral to this edge and darker than the adjacent lung, which lies medial to the edge. The catheter tip is approximately at the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium (black arrow).",
