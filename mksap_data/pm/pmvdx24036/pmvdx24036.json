  "critique": "The most likely electrocardiographic diagnosis is right atrial enlargement (Option C). ECG findings characteristic of right atrial enlargement are tall (≥2.5 mm) and peaked P waves (P pulmonale) in leads II, III, and/or aVF, as seen in this patient's ECG. Although not seen on this ECG, a P wave greater than 1.5 mm tall in V1 or V2 may also indicate right atrial enlargement. Chronic lung disease leading to cor pulmonale, tricuspid stenosis, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary hypertension are the major causes of right atrial enlargement.",
