  "question_text": "An 88-year-old woman is evaluated for a 10-year history of worsening pain in the bilateral hands and knees. She has 30 minutes of stiffness in the morning. The pain is worst in the evening and with activity. Physical and occupational therapy have provided minimal benefit. She has hypertension, and her only medication is amlodipine.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Firm enlargement of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints is present bilaterally, and first carpometacarpal joint tenderness is noted bilaterally. There is bony enlargement of the medial knees, with crepitus on range of motion. The medial joint-line of each knee is tender to palpation.Radiographs of the hands show joint-space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis at the bilateral first carpometacarpal joints, and at multiple proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. Radiographs of the knees show medial joint-space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and small bone cysts. There is a small left-sided effusion.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands and knees is a topical NSAID, such as diclofenac (Option D). Patients with OA are typically older than age 50 years. OA is characterized by insidious onset of intermittent symptoms, which become more persistent and severe over time. The most common symptom is joint pain exacerbated by activity and alleviated with rest. Self-limited morning stiffness lasts less than 30 minutes, in contrast to the prolonged morning stiffness of inflammatory arthritis. The most commonly affected joints are in the hands (distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and first carpometacarpal joints), feet (first metatarsophalangeal and midfoot joints), knees, hips, and cervical and lumbar spine. Joint examination may reveal joint-line tenderness, crepitus, decreased range of motion, bony enlargement without synovitis, and/or joint effusion (most commonly in the knees). Radiographic features include asymmetric joint-space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, and bone cysts. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Arthritis Foundation (AF) guidelines recommend topical NSAIDs as first-line therapy for OA in the hands and knees. Topical NSAIDs are not effective for hip OA and have limited efficacy in OA of other sites. This patient's findings are consistent with OA of the hands and knees, and she should be offered a topical NSAID, such as diclofenac, as first-line therapy.Oral NSAIDs, such as meloxicam (Option A), are endorsed by the ACR/AF for treatment of hand, knee, and hip OA but should be used with caution in patients older than age 50 years and in those with comorbidities, such as hypertension. Trying topical NSAIDs before meloxicam is more appropriate in this patient.Methotrexate (Option B) is first-line therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by prolonged morning stiffness and synovitis, which are not present in this patient. Her symptoms are most consistent with OA.Topical capsaicin (Option C) would not be the most appropriate treatment for this patient with OA of the hands and knees. Data supporting the efficacy of topical capsaicin for knee OA is limited, and no direct evidence supports topical capsaicin in the treatment of hand OA; furthermore, eye contamination is possible when it is used on the hands.",
  "key_points": [
    "Topical NSAIDs are safe and effective for treatment of hand and knee osteoarthritis and should be considered before oral NSAIDs because of their favorable safety profile."
