  "question_text": "A 32-year-old woman is evaluated for a 2-year history of dry eyes and dry mouth. She wakes up in the morning with a foreign body sensation in her eyes. She cannot eat dry foods without consuming large amounts of water. She notes that her cheeks appear bigger than they used to. A previous ophthalmology evaluation revealed abnormal ocular surface staining consistent with dry eyes. She uses artificial tears as needed. She has no other medical problems and takes no other medications.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Examination of the oral cavity reveals multiple dental caries and no pooled saliva under the tongue. Bilateral parotid enlargement is present. The remainder of the examination is normal.Laboratory study results are negative for antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. Testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus is negative. Serum IgG levels are normal.Chest radiograph is normal.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next in this patient with suspected Sjögren disease is a minor salivary gland (lip) biopsy (Option B). A diagnosis of Sjögren disease is typically triggered by symptoms of ocular and oral dryness (sicca), an increase in dental caries, or parotid swelling. Patients report gritty eyes or a foreign body sensation, difficulty eating unmoistened food, and may have noticeable symmetric parotid enlargement. Other exocrine glands can be involved, leading to skin and vaginal dryness. Exocrine gland involvement in the upper respiratory tract may lead to symptoms related to the nose, sinuses, and posterior pharynx. The diagnosis of Sjögren disease requires objective confirmation of exocrinopathy plus demonstration of autoimmunity (see Table: Classification Criteria for Primary Sjögren Disease). When initial laboratory evaluation is uninformative, a minor salivary gland biopsy is recommended. Characteristic histologic features include a focal periductal aggregate of lymphocytes, collectively termed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. This patient presents with clinical evidence of exocrine insufficiency but lacks autoantibodies, so additional diagnostic testing is necessary. Minor salivary gland biopsy is relatively noninvasive, can provide sufficient evidence to meet the diagnostic criteria for Sjögren disease, and may assist in ruling out other causes of sicca with parotid or lacrimal gland enlargement (e.g., IgG4-related disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lymphoma, amyloidosis, and infection). Minor salivary gland biopsy is the least invasive and most informative next step for this patient.Fecal pancreatic elastase (Option A) is decreased in the setting of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, but it is not a useful test to evaluate for salivary gland dysfunction.A parotid gland biopsy (Option C) would also aid in the diagnosis of Sjögren disease and the exclusion of other conditions, but it is more invasive than a lip biopsy and risks damage to the seventh cranial nerve.Serum complement levels (Option D) are elevated in most inflammatory conditions but depressed in certain immune complex–mediated diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus; cryoglobulinemic and urticarial vasculitis). They can be useful in the evaluation of these disease entities, but they do not play a role in the diagnosis of Sjögren disease.",
  "key_points": [
    "Sjögren disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder primarily affecting salivary and lacrimal glands, and characteristic signs and symptoms include sicca and parotid/lacrimal gland swelling.",
    "A minor salivary gland (lip) biopsy should be considered in a patient with sicca and suspected Sjögren disease when initial serologic evaluation is uninformative."
