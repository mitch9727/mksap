  "question_text": "A 33-year-old woman is evaluated for a rash. Over the past 6 months, she has developed plaques on the neck, lower abdomen, and lower extremities. The lesions are mildly painful, and she reports difficulty moving her left ankle. She has no other symptoms. Medical history is noncontributory.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Large, oval, yellow, indurated plaques are present on the right side of the neck, the right lower abdomen around the belt line, and the lower extremities around the ankles. The plaques have an erythematous rim and are mildly warm. No sclerodactyly, telangiectasias, or Raynaud changes in the digits are noted. Range of motion in the left ankle is limited.Laboratory results:Antinuclear antibody panelNegativeFindings on biopsy of the plaque on the lower abdomen are consistent with scleroderma.",

  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is morphea (Option C). Morphea, a type of localized scleroderma, is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that leads to sclerotic changes in the skin. Morphea plaques occur on the face, head, neck, trunk (especially around the belt line), and lower extremities. They are usually oval and initially are indurated, with a yellow to brown color. When the lesions are active, they are surrounded by a violaceous halo. Over time, the plaques may appear more atrophic and less indurated. Several different types of morphea are recognized, including localized (one to three lesions), generalized (four lesions affecting two separate anatomic sites), pansclerotic (diffuse skin involvement sparing the fingers and toes and affecting deeper tissues), and linear scleroderma. Patients with morphea lack Raynaud phenomenon as part of the disease process. Morphea spares the internal organs, lacks sclerodactyly and nailfold capillary changes, and does not present with scleroderma autoantibodies. In severe cases, adjacent tissues, such as muscle, fascia, or bone (rare), may be involved. Patients with morphea affecting the neck, face, or scalp should undergo MRI of the head to evaluate for possible involvement of adjacent brain tissue.Eosinophilic fasciitis (Option A) is considered a scleroderma variant because of the fibrosing nature of the disease. However, the area involved in eosinophilic fasciitis is the fascia, not specifically the skin. Eosinophilic fasciitis affects the extremities with painful diffuse induration and spares the hands and feet. A groove sign along the course of larger superficial veins is characteristic. The skin may also have a peau d’orange (orange peel) appearance.Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (LcSSc) (Option B) is associated with scleroderma autoantibodies, specifically anticentromere antibody. Manifestations of LcSSc may include calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasis. Localized plaques are not a feature of LcSSc.Scleredema (Option D) is a scleroderma-like disorder characterized by fibro-mucinous induration of the upper back, neck, upper arms, and occasionally the face. In adults, it is most commonly seen in association with diabetes (scleredema diabeticorum) but also can occur with paraproteinemia. In younger patients, scleredema may follow a febrile infectious illness, and the skin changes may resolve over time. Given the pattern of skin involvement in this patient, which also includes the lesions on the lower abdomen and lower extremities, and the fact that the patient does not have diabetes or a recent febrile illness, the diagnosis of scleredema is unlikely.",
