  "question_text": "A 78-year-old woman is evaluated for 10 years of worsening left knee pain due to osteoarthritis. Her ability to ambulate is limited, and she is now experiencing pain at rest and at night. Symptoms substantially interfere with daily activities. Physical therapy, yoga, and tai chi have provided minimal benefit. Her symptoms are partially relieved with NSAIDs; however, acetaminophen and duloxetine were ineffective. Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections no longer provide substantial or sustained benefit.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Range of motion testing of the knee elicits crepitus. There is medial joint line pain. No meniscal or ligamentous abnormalities are noted.Radiographs reveal marked narrowing of the medial compartment of the left knee joint and moderate narrowing of the patellofemoral joint. Osteophytes at the joint margin with subchondral sclerosis are present.",

  "critique": "The most appropriate next step in management is total knee replacement (Option D). Surgery for osteoarthritis (OA) may be considered when nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches fail to control pain or improve functional limitation. Typical indications for total knee replacement (knee arthroplasty) are debilitating pain and major limitations in fundamental activities of daily living, such as walking, working, and sleeping. The 2023 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons clinical practice guideline for the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate to severe OA conditionally recommends against delaying total joint arthroplasty to pursue additional nonoperative treatments in patients who have symptomatic and radiographic moderate to severe OA for whom nonoperative therapy was ineffective. Total knee replacement relieves pain and improves function, with excellent long-term outcomes. This patient's symptoms and functional impairments are refractory to recommended nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions. Therefore, proceeding with total knee replacement is appropriate.Arthroscopic debridement (Option A) is not recommended in the treatment of knee OA. Several large, randomized studies have found that this arthroscopic intervention does not offer therapeutic benefit at 6 months or at 1 or 2 years postoperatively compared with a sham surgical procedure or an exercise control.Opioid use should generally be avoided in the treatment of OA because evidence shows only slight benefit and a high risk for toxicity and dependence. Opioids should be considered only when symptoms are intolerable and when no other therapeutic alternatives exist. Hydrocodone (Option B) is not the most appropriate treatment option for this patient.The ACR, the Arthritis Foundation, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommend against the use of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections (Option C) in patients with knee OA because studies showing benefit are lacking.",
