  "question_text": "A 32-year-old man is evaluated for a 4-month history of progressive polyarticular joint pain. He experiences morning stiffness lasting 45 minutes. His only medication is ibuprofen, which he has been taking three times daily for the past month.On physical examination, vital signs are normal. Swelling and tenderness of the second and fourth metacarpophalangeal joints, wrists, knees, and ankles are present bilaterally. Tenderness on compression of the metatarsophalangeal joints in both feet is noted. No rashes or skin changes are observed.",

  "critique": "In this patient suspected of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most useful diagnostic tests will be measurement of rheumatoid factor and anti窶田yclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies (Option D). RA, a chronic inflammatory condition, most characteristically affects the metacarpophalangeal joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet in a symmetric manner. Wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles can also be involved. Rheumatoid factor is an immunoglobulin, usually IgM, directed against the Fc portion of IgG. Rheumatoid factor occurs in approximately 70% of patients with RA. Because rheumatoid factor can be associated with other diseases (e.g., viral hepatitis) and because its presence increases with age, the specificity of rheumatoid factor is limited at about 85%. Anti-CCP antibodies are highly specific to RA; in a patient with typical joint symptoms and findings, the specificity is 95%, making this a useful confirmatory test. However, anti-CCP antibodies are present in only about 70% of patients with RA. In patients suspected of having RA, anti-CCP antibodies are more predictive than rheumatoid factor for erosive disease. Positivity for either or both tests increases the likelihood of RA.Antinuclear antibody titer (Option A) abnormalities are associated with many autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and some juvenile-onset forms of inflammatory arthritis. Therefore, it may be a useful test to rule out alternate potential causes of symptoms, but it is not useful for diagnosing RA in this patient.Many patients with active RA have an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (Option B) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); abnormal findings can support a diagnosis of RA when this condition is being distinguished from noninflammatory joint disorders. However, CRP and ESR are nonspecific markers of inflammation and are not the most useful diagnostic test for this patient.A positive HLA-B27 antigen (Option C) result is present in most patients with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and other spondyloarthropathies. It is not uncommon in healthy individuals and is not associated with RA. Thus, HLA-B27 antigen testing is not appropriate for this patient.",

    "Rheumatoid factor and anti窶田yclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies are each approximately 70% sensitive for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, but anti-CCP antibodies are more specific (95%)."
