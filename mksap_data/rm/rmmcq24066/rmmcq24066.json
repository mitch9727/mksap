  "question_text": "A 69-year-old patient is evaluated in the emergency department for 1 day of progressive pain and swelling of the left knee. They have hypertension treated with daily hydrochlorothiazide.On physical examination, temperature is 37.3 °C (99.2 °F); other vital signs are normal. The left knee is warm, red, tender, and swollen. The joint has limited range of motion due to pain. The remainder of the examination is normal.Laboratory studies:Erythrocyte sedimentation rate62 mm/hHLeukocyte count12,300/μL (12.3 × 109/L)HUrate8.3 mg/dL (0.50 mmol/L)HThe left knee is aspirated, and 20 mL of cloudy yellow fluid is removed. Synovial fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 22,000/μL (22 × 109/L), with 83% neutrophils, and rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent crystals under polarizing microscopy, including intracellularly in neutrophils. Gram stain is negative; culture is pending.Radiographs of the knees show mild medial compartment narrowing, with small osteophytes and faint calcification in the menisci bilaterally.",

  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (Option A). Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout) typically presents as a monoarticular or oligoarticular inflammatory arthritis, characterized by rapid onset of swelling, pain, loss of function, tenderness, and warmth of the affected joint (commonly a knee or wrist). CPP cartilage calcification (chondrocalcinosis) appears on radiographs as a linear opacity below the surface of articular cartilage. Definitive diagnosis requires identification of CPP crystals along with an inflammatory cell infiltrate in the synovial fluid. Crystals are rhomboid-shaped (occasionally rod-shaped) and are positively birefringent.The diagnosis of acute CPP crystal arthritis in this patient is supported by consistent clinical findings; the presence of positively birefringent crystals extracellularly and in neutrophils, indicating that the crystals are driving the inflammatory state; and the presence of meniscal calcification (chondrocalcinosis) on radiographs. Because crystal arthritis and infection may coexist, it is important to assess for infection even after acute CPP crystal arthritis has been diagnosed. In this patient, concurrent infection is less likely because the Gram stain is negative and the synovial fluid leukocyte count is less than 50,000/μL (50 × 109/L). Nonetheless, the joint fluid culture results are needed to definitively rule out infection.Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) deposition (Option B) is rarely associated with inflammatory arthritis, most classically manifesting as “Milwaukee shoulder” with progressive destruction of the rotator cuff and glenohumeral joint. BCP crystals are small and amorphous and not visible on plain or polarizing microscopy. Inflammatory knee arthritis is an unlikely presentation of BCP deposition, and this patient's crystals are consistent with acute CPP crystal arthritis.Although this patient may have gout (Option C) given their hyperuricemia, monosodium urate crystals, which are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent, are not present. Therefore, acute gout is unlikely.Although the patient appears to have mild osteoarthritis (Option D) on radiographs, osteoarthritis is not typically a highly inflammatory condition. The presence of CPP crystals and an elevated leukocyte count in the synovial fluid make osteoarthritis an unlikely explanation for the patient's current signs and symptoms.",
