  "critique": "This patient's knee radiograph shows typical changes of advanced osteoarthritis (Option A) with severe medial joint-space narrowing; there is almost bone-on-bone contact with subchondral sclerosis. Mild medial osteophyte formation and an osteochondral lesion in the medial femoral condyle are also present. In addition, there is linear calcification of the lateral meniscus suggestive of chondrocalcinosis. However, the patient's history does not suggest pseudogout (acute calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis), as the patient does not have a history of an intermittently painful or swollen knee. Hence, chondrocalcinosis is an incidental finding in this case.",
