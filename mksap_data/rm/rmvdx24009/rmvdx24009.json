  "critique": "This radiograph shows findings consistent with psoriatic arthritis (Option C), including the simultaneous erosive changes and lysis of the terminal phalanges with periostitis and new bone formation, often within the same joint. This frequently leads to ankylosis and gross destruction of isolated joints. When advanced, these changes may cause the characteristic pencil-in-cup appearance of some joints associated with psoriatic arthritis, as shown in the radiograph of this patient's hand.",
