Sclerodactyly is a localized thickening and tightness of the skin of the fingers or toes. The skin appears shiny, tight, and closely adherent. Sclerodactyly is frequently associated with atrophy of the underlying soft tissues.In addition, this patient's comorbid conditions are typical findings in systemic sclerosis. Most patients with systemic sclerosis have Raynaud phenomenon, which usually precedes the development of skin changes. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is also common in all forms of systemic sclerosis and may be an early disease manifestation.",
