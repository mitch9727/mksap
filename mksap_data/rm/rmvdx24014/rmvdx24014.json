  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis (TA) (Option D). TA causes inflammation of the large vessels, most commonly the aorta, followed by the subclavian, common carotid, and renal arteries; the pulmonary arteries also may be involved. TA manifestations include constitutional symptoms, carotidynia, limb claudication, reduced pulses, bruits, and blood pressure discrepancies between the arms. This patient's aortic angiogram demonstrates high-grade stenosis of the proximal right subclavian artery (white arrow) and left subclavian artery just below the origin of the left vertebral artery (black arrow). Incidentally noted is anatomic variation with a common origin of the right brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery.",
