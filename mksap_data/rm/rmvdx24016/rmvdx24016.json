  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis for the rash shown is subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) (Option D), which is characterized by annular or papulosquamous (psoriasis-like) lesions that are typically light induced. The annular lesions are bright red with central clearing, as seen in this patient. The papulosquamous lesions are bright red plaques with sharp borders and fine scaling. SCLE may be induced by medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and terbinafine. In systemic lupus erythematosus–associated SCLE, other common clinical manifestations include arthralgia and serositis. Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are seen in the majority of patients with SCLE.",
