  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis (Option B). This patient demonstrates the characteristic prominence and squaring of osteoarthritis involving the thumb base due to osteophyte formation and subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint. The hand joints most commonly involved in osteoarthritis include the first carpometacarpal, distal interphalangeal (DIP), and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. The metacarpophalangeal joints are usually spared in osteoarthritis. Findings on physical examination typically include bony enlargement and malalignment. Heberden and/or Bouchard nodes are terms used to describe the ossified growths at the medial and dorsolateral aspects of the DIP or PIP joints, respectively.",
