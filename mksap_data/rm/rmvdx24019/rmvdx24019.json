  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is immune complex–mediated vasculitis (Option A). Although any tissue or organ may be affected, the classic finding is invariably in the skin, as seen in this patient. Immune complexes form from cross-linking of multiple antigens and antibodies. If not cleared, immune complexes deposit in tissue, leading to complement and neutrophil activation with inflammation and tissue damage. Inflammation and erythrocyte extravasation from involved vessels result in nonblanching palpable purpura, usually in dependent areas. The lesions in immune thrombocytopenic purpura are not palpable.",
