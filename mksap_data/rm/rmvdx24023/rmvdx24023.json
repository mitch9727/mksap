  "critique": "This patient has manifestations of calcinosis cutis, and the most likely diagnosis is limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (Option A), formerly known as CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome. Calcinosis occurs in approximately 25% of patients with systemic sclerosis. Present in the hands, forearms, elbows (as in this patient), gluteal region, and iliac crest, these deposits can be seen or felt and are easily detected on a radiograph. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is commonly associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Knowledge of the patient's history is often sufficient to distinguish calcinosis cutis from other nodular skin diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and tophi.",
