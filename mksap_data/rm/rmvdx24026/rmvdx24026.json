DLE consists of slowly progressive, scaly infiltrative papules and plaques or atrophic red plaques on sun-exposed skin surfaces. Other chronic lesions may be hypertrophic or verrucous appearing. Most patients with DLE, particularly those whose lesions are only on the head and neck, often do not have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is estimated that 5% to 25% of patients with DLE have coexisting SLE.",
