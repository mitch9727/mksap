Mechanic's hands are a dermatologic manifestation unique to antisynthetase syndrome and are characterized by hyperkeratotic, fissured skin on the palmar and lateral aspects of the fingers. Unlike in eczema, there is no pruritus, vesicles, or hand dominance. Antisynthetase syndrome occurs in approximately 30% of patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis.",
