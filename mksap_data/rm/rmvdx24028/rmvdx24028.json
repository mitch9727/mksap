ACLE can present as the classic butterfly rash, which is characterized by confluent malar erythema with sparing of the nasolabial folds, as seen here. ACLE can also present as generalized, red, papular, or urticarial lesions on sun-exposed skin. ACLE is found almost exclusively in patients with symptomatic systemic lupus erythematosus and positive results on serologic testing.",
