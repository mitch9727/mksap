This patient has Milwaukee shoulder, a classic manifestation of intra-articular BCP deposition. Milwaukee shoulder is a destructive, chronic arthropathy often associated with a large, noninflammatory effusion and commonly occurring in older women. This patient's radiograph demonstrates glenohumeral joint degradation and a “high-riding” humeral head.",
