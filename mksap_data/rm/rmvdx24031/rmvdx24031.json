  "critique": "This patient has rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Option C). RA characteristically affects the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and proximal interphalangeal joints but spares the distal interphalangeal joints. Wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles can also be involved, and the disease tends to affect joints symmetrically. This patient has swelling in the left wrist, the MCP joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints but no obvious swelling of the distal interphalangeal joints. The presence of intrinsic muscle wasting shown in this image is typical of more longstanding RA. Additionally, ulnar deviation of the MCP joints is beginning to develop on this patient's left hand. Prompt therapy with disease-modifying agents is necessary to prevent further damage.",
