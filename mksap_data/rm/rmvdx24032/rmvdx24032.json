  "critique": "This patient has subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) (Option C). SCLE is a photosensitive rash typically appearing on the shoulders, back, arms, and neck after sun exposure. This rash can appear as ring-shaped lesions with scaly borders or scaly red bumps. The rash is not pruritic or painful and resolves without scarring, but dyspigmentation may occur. SCLE can be drug induced or a manifestation of underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. Most patients with SCLE are positive for anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies. Treatment includes photoprotection, topical glucocorticoids, and, if needed, hydroxychloroquine.",
