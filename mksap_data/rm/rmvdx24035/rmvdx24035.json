  "critique": "The most likely diagnosis is IgA vasculitis (Option B). IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is a small-vessel vasculitis that is most common in children. Patients classically present with palpable purpura that typically develop in dependent areas of the body. Biopsy of these lesions demonstrates leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition. Other common findings in IgA vasculitis include arthritis and arthralgia, abdominal pain or gastrointestinal bleeding, and glomerulonephritis, which is more common in adults than in children.Immune thrombocytopenia can produce lesions of similar size and location, but they are not raised or palpable. Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis affect large vessels, not the small postcapillary venules seen in leukocytoclastic vasculitis.",
